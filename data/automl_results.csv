Intel,nice to see that Intel is actually putting resources into fixing cpu overhead,Positive
Intel,"Fixed/improved in some cases, on a game-by-game basis.  Better than nothing, but far from actually *fixed* fixed. Steve says he'll be testing more games and resolutions shortly, but I'd also like to see direct comparisons between a pre-fix driver and the newest.",Neutral
Intel,"While it's great to see improvements, those still seem to be on a case by case basis.   The root cause is still there and if there are more powerful cards coming (big if), then the issue will shift up again.   But hey maybe Nvidia can start prioritising the overhead issue as well while we're at it.",Negative
Intel,"Huh, didn't expect that. Good job, Intel.  B580s mostly aren't super-worth buying atm, but this is a really good sign for future Intel products (assuming there will be any of course) as well as obviously good news for people who bought B580s.",Positive
Intel,How is idle power usage?,Neutral
Intel,"What I took away from the video: more or less fine with 5600 and up, still struggles with 2600. Intel is doing per game optimizations, so your mileage may vary. Space Marine is still struggling, Spider man 1 is running great, SpiderMan 2 does not.  Drivers are constantly improving, HUB has bright outlook. The bigger issue is 9060XT8 within 10-15% price range, but delivering 30% better perf.     Edit: A lot of people talking about how old or slow 2600 is in replies. And that's part of the point, I obviously didn't get across well. The issue is not the absolute performance, but the relative loss compared to AMD. In CPU bound scenarios they both should be close, since the limiting factor is CPU. But in this scenario 9060XT is even further ahead than when they are unconstrained.",Neutral
Intel,"Lol, just in time for the Panther Lake announcement. But credit where it's due.",Neutral
Intel,Mildly interesting B580 news! There seems to be some improvements to the CPU overhead problem,Positive
Intel,Could this have been a bug on Ryzen only? Did they ever test the 12400 or something like it in comparison to a Ryzen 5600?,Neutral
Intel,"I thought people were pretty sure it was an entirely hardware problem that can't be alleviated with driver fixes.  Guess they were wrong somewhat. I think the claim that it can't be completely fixed still seems to stand, but it can be alleviated alright.",Negative
Intel,"Meanwhile Intel Vulkan drivers on Linux are absolute garbage, they provide less than 50% of the performance of what's available on windows. It's so bad, that usng WineD3D (DirectX to OpenGL) gives better performance than  DXVK (DirectX to Vulkan).",Negative
Intel,"I bought an Arc A380 for $100 when it first launched, have been comfy 1080p gaming ever since, graphics / software maturity and improvement has been amazing.  I can't wait to see the B770 (or whatever they decide to call it) and also Arc C580 based on Xe3-HPG (Celestial)",Positive
Intel,72 up upvotes on a duplicate post when someone posted it an hour earlier. WTH Reddit.,Negative
Intel,"I still remember the day when amd took over ati and finally got to hd 7xxx series aka the first trully new microarch since the purchase and they launched the first multithreaded version of the drivers for the tahiti? One version of the hd 7850xt, then the 7950 and 7970 giving everyone basically a massive perf improvement, less frame to frame latency and like a two digit perf uplift... Sounds a lot like what intel is going through. Who knows maybe in 10 more years intel shows their 1080 or whatever ends up being called and is competing in the high tier. It's been impressive, considering 10 year ago hey were basically on worthless igps only good for quicksync h264 low quality encoding.",Positive
Intel,"> Fixed/improved in some cases, on a game-by-game basis. Better than nothing, but far from actually fixed fixed.  :(",Negative
Intel,unrelated but whats up with the 1488 in your username,Neutral
Intel,I'm noticing the 8gb card has better averages & lows than 12gb,Positive
Intel,which version is this,Neutral
Intel,Thats terrific from Intel.  Hopefully they can still improve on it and ofcourse continue releasing & developing GPUs. Maybe two generations down the line we would be considering Intel GPUs over AMD.,Positive
Intel,"I mean that’s ok, but for Spider-Man, which was the most detailed view, it looked more like the 9060 xt performed inconsistent with the 5600.  20% uplift on lower and higher quality CPUs. I would have expected there to been a consistency across all of them if this was the case.   I would still not even consider recommending a 570/580 to a friend over even the 8 gb models of nvidia and amd.",Neutral
Intel,"TL;DR improved, but far from fixed, clickbait title.",Negative
Intel,"I can't reccomend Arc to anyone, there's 0% chance the arc driver team still exists in 2 years.",Negative
Intel,"Intel is really turning things around, looking forward to what they have moving into the future",Positive
Intel,Should've used RTX 4060 instead. Previous tests also showed that AMD GPUs too can suffer from CPU overhead.,Negative
Intel,Intel: lets make amd cpu work slow with code-compiler tricks  Amd cpu: slow and make overhead in games but only for Intel gpu.  Intel: can't sell low-end gpu for high-end cpu  Intel: removes amd-cpu dampener.,Negative
Intel,"this is so sad,  because intel just officially ended arc :/  remember, that nvidia wouldn't have intel use nvidia graphics chiplets in apus, if arc wasn't dead dead.  so you can't suggest arc anymore, because intel sure as shit won't properly support it longterm at all.  and this SUCKS, because the b580 at least had the barest minimum vram, that works rightnow.  in a different timeline arc would still be cooking and the royal core project didn't get nuked by an idiot.  but well it is what it is.",Negative
Intel,"Probably Nvidia engineers helped them make better drivers, since Nvidia owns them",Positive
Intel,"a lot of people dog on them and spread fear mongering info about their GPU division and ARC support, but they've been doing quite well in terms of support. I got a Claw 8AI+ and they've been pushing updates with performance optimizations for mobile arc as well.",Positive
Intel,The CPU bottleneck didn't happen universally either. Some games others tested didn't suffer from it.,Negative
Intel,There is a direct comparison between driver versions in the video.,Neutral
Intel,"Remins me of the first Alchemist GPUs which were abysmally slow in older games and there were headlines of like ""new drivers bring 30% more performance!"" every few months an then it turned out it got that benefit in some DX9 game nobody play anymore than the rest barely improved...",Negative
Intel,"Once Intel figures out how to make QuickSync use the full potential of these cards, they’ll be unmatched for anyone that does video work.",Neutral
Intel,They are worth if they're at MSRP. 12GB for $249 is great.,Positive
Intel,"Since 2600 is Zen+, I would've been more interested to see where 3600/Zen 2 landed between the Zen+ and Zen 3 CPUs since my old 3600 is in my brother's PC as an upgrade from i5-4460 and his GTX 1060 is starting to fail (one of the vram chips has errors in nvidia mats after running mods so it sometimes runs fine in idle but under load it randomly freezes [can take seconds or an hour] and/or artifacts and then either TDR manages to reset the GPU or not and PC crashes) so he's also now rocking my old GTX 960.",Neutral
Intel,">still struggles with 2600  as someone who upgraded from Ryzen 3800X -> 5600X -> 5800X3D -> 9800X3D, I noticed all upgrades in CPU-heavy games even at 1440p (hello, MMORPGs or Escape from Tarkov) and if you're playing with Ryzen 2600 in 2025(almost 2026) you'll end up with mediocre experience even without considering overhead problem - I agree with your point, I just think that in 2025 Ryzen 2600 is an outdated CPU and considering AM4 upgradability, it should be changed to 5600/5600x3d/5700x3d/5800x3d to get a proper experience without being CPU-limited in some games.

Intel,Imagine buying a brand new current gen GPU in 2025 while still gaming on 7 year old Zen 1+ fabbed on that delicious Global Foundries 12nm.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, in EU the 9060XT is 20€ more, and for that you get:  * noticeably more perf. * more mature driver, game support, feature,... * no random issues like this (and several more)  IDK whether anyone would even consider the B580 here.",Neutral
Intel,2600 is slower than haswell in games,Negative
Intel,At 1080p.   Now have HWU go test TLOU2 or any other memory intensive stress test they’ve done in the past with any other 8gb card.   B580 scales excellent up to 1440p.   The 8gb cards are going to fall flat on their face.,Neutral
Intel,Don't know about discrete but integrated graphics are fine on Linux with DXVK.  Played GTA IV with Tiger Lake Iris Xe using Proton and got 40-60 FPS at 1080p High settings with the random FPS drops I get in Windows completely gone.,Positive
Intel,Good thing the drivers are Open Source so The Community(TM) can improve them.,Positive
Intel,I’m guessing this is because of the dumpster fire that is Xe drivers,Negative
Intel,"Share the post you're talking about, I shared this video in \~5 minutes timeline after it was released on YouTube, and your scenario is not realistic.",Negative
Intel,I'm Scottish and it's related to [Battle of Sauchieburn.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sauchieburn),Neutral
Intel,"Well, that's to be expected if a game doesn't actually require more than 8GB.  But there's also the second issue (at least in some games) that a game simply reduces texture quality etc. automatically without your consent if it would go above the VRAM limit otherwise or some textures actually take a lot longer to load in properly which is not reflected in the framerate comparison.",Negative
Intel,"He's using 1080p medium to lower the stress on the gpu and better reveal the driver problem.  Use a more demanding setting and maybe the vram becomes relevant, but that's a different video.",Neutral
Intel,See for yourself:  https://youtu.be/gfqGqj2bFj8?t=700  7028 and up seem to have that fix.,Neutral
Intel,"What do you mean in two generations? Arc at MSRP is a perfectly viable choice. It has pros and cons, but Arc is competitive.",Neutral
Intel,actually previous tests have shown amd to have less overhead than nvidia [https://youtu.be/JLEIJhunaW8](https://youtu.be/JLEIJhunaW8),Neutral
Intel,"The change happened in August with the 7028 version driver release, odds are they've been working on this for months.  Intel has really good engineers too. Nvidia has nothing to do with this.",Positive
Intel,"I really hope you’re joking here. You know an announcement of future products doesn’t automagically mean what you wrote, right?",Neutral
Intel,MLID is a clown,Neutral
Intel,8AI+ is an underrated handheld.,Neutral
Intel,intel *should* be dominating the handheld space.  their mobile cpus are plenty good and their strategy of offloading gpu work to the cpu makes tons of sense on an igpu.  honestly i was surprised the 1st gen claw wasn't competitive.,Positive
Intel,"But it still does suffer in many games in the video.  The video title is misleading. This should be celebrated, but not as a ""fix"".",Negative
Intel,For one game. I'd like to see which games improved and by how much.,Neutral
Intel,"I mean, that's how drivers mature.  Some game saw 30% boost, but everything else using that code maybe saw a 1% boost.  And then you do the same for another game and so on until you've covered the weird cases and everything else gets a stack of little 1% boosts that collectively add up to their own big boost.  It's a bunch of work and doesn't happen overnight.",Neutral
Intel,I think that was just them bolting the open source dxvk into their driver.,Neutral
Intel,"> abysmally slow in older games  This is still the case in some games. One that Ive had first hand experience with is Resident Evil Revelations 2.  For some reason theres a shader caching issue where for the first 3ish minutes on every level its single digit frame rates. After it ""loads"" everything its perfectly normal.    Never had that issue on my older, far less powerful, system.",Negative
Intel,"They're already the fastest card for AV1 and other codecs outside of industry-made FPGA/ASICs for television studios. Primere Pro, DaVinci, and other editing software have to support it.",Neutral
Intel,"Maybe it's region-dependent, but where I live the 8Gb 9060XT is 10% more but it's a \*lot\* faster.  I don't think either of those represents great value. One is crippled because of the VRAM, the other one is just slow for the asking price.  IMO the 9060XT 16Gb is the cheapest GPU genuinely worth buying right now. The B580 and the nVidia and AMD options closest to it have too many drawbacks.",Negative
Intel,"CPU is king if you're looking for a smooth and responsive system - sure, gpu well likely dictate average fps, but fps dips tend to be due to cpu and in the cases where they aren't, you can just adjust graphics settings.",Neutral
Intel,"Hardware Canucks made a whole video on the [5060ti vs 9060xt on multiple CPUs](https://youtu.be/NqRTVzk2PXs)  Even Nvidia and AMD cards to an extent suffer from notable performance losses particularly on more CPU reliant games like spiderman from the 2600's level of performance. The CPU is just too weak to run with midrange and higher cards in 2025. I remember my 2600x struggling to maintain 165fps in valorant of all games. The moment I moved to a 5600 it shot up to 300 fps, and this was just on an rtx 2060.",Negative
Intel,"> and if you're playing with Ryzen 2600 in 2025(almost 2026) you'll end up with mediocre experience  If you were playing CPU heavy games, it was a mediocre experience even back when it released.  Anyone who cared about CPU performance when it came to gaming. Didn't eve look at Zen before Zen 2. That's when they started getting some wins in ST heavy games thanks to the cache. But the double CCX layout still limited performance. Then with Zen 3 is when they finally reached parity with Comet Lake.",Negative
Intel,"I have a 5600x and plan to get the 5800x3D soon, did you notice much performance gains when you upgraded?",Neutral
Intel,"If you have a limited budget, you would upgrade part of the system at a time and whatever limits you hit.  Not everybody have unlimited money glitch to upgrade everything all at once to the latest and greatest.  I prioritize my upgrades to CPU, so but had to upgrade my RX480 earlier this year when game (e.g. Indiana Jones) start requiring raytracing to run.  I upgraded my CPU after fing a good deal on 5800X and also due to Windows 11 won't official run on my 1700.",Neutral
Intel,"Entirely plausible, if you can't afford a rig overhaul but your GPU shits the bed.",Neutral
Intel,It's a budget GPU; I'm not exactly sure why you think that's not a valid use case.,Negative
Intel,>IDK whether anyone would even consider the B580 here.  Media and productivity tasks.  Quicksync is way more faster and more quality especially in AV1. More formats like HEVC 10-bit 4:2:2 are also supported.  Blender score is much higher for B580 than 9060XT.  And 12GB VRAM makes a difference compared to 8GB.,Positive
Intel,"It's slower than 6700k and 7700k at max boost frequency in many games but Haswell (core 4000 series) is a stretch. Maybe it's slower than a highly overclocked 4770k in specific titles that are highly frequency dependent. But not overall. There are enough modern games that benefit from 12 threads over 8, back when 2600 launched there definitely were not.",Negative
Intel,Bullshit. Based on what?,Neutral
Intel,">B580 scales excellent up to 1440p.   Despite its VRAM deficit, the 9060 XT 8 GB is 23% faster than the B580 at 1440p with maximum settings according to [TechPowerUp](https://tpucdn.com/review/powercolor-radeon-rx-9060-xt-reaper-8-gb/images/relative-performance-2560-1440.png).",Positive
Intel,"I have an Intel Arc A380, it's supposed to be more or less equal with Radeon RX 6400, but for example Guid Wars 2 runs at around 80-90 FPS on 6400 in some of the older zones (outside of Lion's Arch), but only 38-39 FPS on Arc A380. It's not a problem for me, because I didn't buy it for its Vulkan performance, I just needed a GPU that can run 3 monitors and ideally with hardware encoding and A380 is great for that.

Intel,"Welp my comment was about gaming (as the video)  But even if you consider productivity and media, the Arc still got dunked on by Nvidia card.  * The 5050 (240€) is 20€ cheaper, similar gaming performance, 20% faster blender perf. * The 5060 (280€) is 20€ more, 20% more gaming perf, **more than 50%** perf in blender.  You also get the whole DLSS RTX shebangs, for media NVENC is at least equal if not better than QuickSync. The only thing the arc got going for it is the 12GB.

Intel,"It's an nVidia problem, well-known for years, which exists for both Intel and AMD processors.",Neutral
Intel,"Intel has been putting in work on their drivers. They've been playing catch-up with AMD and Nvidias years of experience.    ...but lets not pretend they're making maracles here.

Intel,"Of course, and as I said, it should be celebrated.",Neutral
Intel,"Not really... If you only game it's worth upgrading the GPU more often, if you mostly work, the GPU can be upgraded every console cycle or less.  Unless you mess up with bad choices, e.g. buying the last 4 threads cpu ever made.",Neutral
Intel,"Quicksync has less artifacts/blockiness in actual AV1 side-by-side comparisons. And encoding speed is faster. And it has two encoders.  Also 8GB is very bad for the price, you could have 8GB RX480 for $220 in 2016. Plenty of games have issues with 8GB already and it will only get worse.",Neutral
Intel,"I think they mean the range lacks a high end, or even a midrange.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes but I am specifically looking for a lot more performance, the B580/9060XT isn't enough performance for me.     I'm saying within 2 generations because i'm hoping within those 2 generations they'll be at an affordable price while being similar to a 5090 performance.",Neutral
Intel,"I thought about it and you're right. I was thinking about it in the context of either not having any system, or having one so old that it's useless for your intended use case.. where you would buy parts every few months before finally having a complete system a year or two later. In that scenario, I'm 100% right. On the other hand, if you have a workable system, then sure, it makes sense to upgrade where needed, and in that context, you're the one that's right.

Intel,"They aren't, though. FSR Frame Gen works on Nvidia Hardware",Neutral
Intel,Honestly we are gaining more from proprietary features than we lose from them being locked behind certain brands.

Intel,"Yes but FSR support is all over the place. Look at what optiscaler is doing, we could have had an open standard for upscalers that FSR XESS and DLSS could have been built on top of meaning much wider support across games instead of every game needing specific implementation and leaving us with outdated upscalers that we need driver overrides and DLL swaps to get around.  Microsoft is only now working on a directX based upscaler API that solves this problem. We should have had something like that years ago like we did for RT.",Negative
Intel,"I mean, surely it depends on when they have to share it. If they can release with the feature exclusively first, but then have to share at or after release, then it can still help the current generation of their cards until it's time for the new gen.",Neutral

Intel,The DirectX RT spec and SDK came out in 2018. The blame lies entirely on AMD. Imagine Nvidia waiting for AMD to agree,Neutral
Intel,I would imagine intel has to at least get celestial out the door before cutting off their GPU line. it's been so long in development that it would be more of a waste of money to cancel it then finish it and see how it sells. at least getting it to the public means some kind of ROI and a solid position in the lower end of the GPU market that AMD and Nvidia are abandoning to the used market.,Negative

Intel,"You have to look at this from both sides.  This would give NVidia the ability to offer OEMs a tightly integrated on SOC gfx solution vs a separate discrete gfx package as it is now. This would lower costs for NVidia's customers as well as improve performance and Intel's cpu's get to ride that train.   Intel has a long track record of using integrated gfx so it's certainly right up their alley to take this on.  Could Xe gfx coexist with NVidia? Yep, I think so.  Xe could be the budget igfx option and iNVidia is the premium integrated solution. That's basically how it is now with Intel Arc/Battlemage & GTX.   On the DC side, Intel has absolutely no gfx solution at this time and won't have anything for at least two years.  Intel already sells NVidia when a gfx solutions are needed so tighter integrated products will benefit both sides in that DC space as well.",Positive
Intel,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work. And even if NVIDIA wants to keep Intel's fabs open, I doubt they want to run them either.",Neutral

If you are referring to AIB Partners, then that can hardly be called an actual partnership. That's more of a contracted labor and distribution agreement.

Intel,"That really is up for debate. That they are losing money on them when you account for RNE and RnD amortized by unit, sure. That I have no doubt about.

We all know with RTX tech those Laptop CPUs will sell a whole lot more and make intel way more profit. Anything with Nvidia's tech sells like pancakes now.  So going forward they can't recover Xe development costs through the laptop iGPUs using like they did before. Remember laptop iGPUs are the highest volume ARC sales.  Without those sale it's hard to justify full on Xe spending needed for dGPUs. Especially with Intel's financial situation.",Neutral
Intel,"This deal seems crazy.  For Nvidia that's an easy way to get custom x86 CPUs for datacenters and a way to directly compete with Strix Halo tier products.   If the products suck they can just blame Intel and walk out as if nothing ever happened. They don't really have much to lose here.  Even if they cancel their own CPU cores as a result of this deal, they can still use stock ARM cores in the future when/if the partnership ends...  But for Intel? For Intel this seems like a complete nightmare.  What did it take for them to convince Nvidia? It's hard to believe this won't have any impact on Arc... In the worse case scenario they'll be giving up on high-end graphics, just for Nvidia to abandon them right after when x86 isn't as important anymore...

Intel,There are definitely more Intel ARC iGPU users than Arc GPU users. This will lead to a cut in workforce (already happened) and more in the future. This also means less investment into things like XeSS.,Negative
Intel,The thing is that Intel barely sells any dedicated ARC cards. Almost all of their graphics userbase comes from Intel integrated graphics with their new XE tiles on them.

Like, the volume for both ""launches"" is supposed to be low, actual devices probably won't be available to purchase until the next year, but. Companies are supposed to be receiving samples of Panther Lake. Now. Presently.   For them to say their roadmap isn't affected, isn't changed at all. Unless that's a massive lie, that's only possible if samples of integrated Xe3 have already been fabbed, are already in working silicon.   ...Like, not to get too into the rumor mill, but supposedly the early Panther Lake samples aren't doing great. The CPU side isn't very efficient compared to Lunar Lake, and the GPUs sometimes don't work. But, when they do work, supposedly, the performance is really good, and, again, rumors, but the problem is supposedly more about Intel's drivers than the hardware or architecture itself.   ...I can completely believe that Intel would panic and would rather kill their GPU division entirely than. Invest in their software stack. Developing good technology and then abandoning it instead of advancing, because abandoning it is cheaper and easier is an extremely Intel move.

Intel,"I think client inference is kind of stupid. It's limited in capability by your local memory amount, and it's economically inefficient because you can't batch requests.  No AI system that exists is ""there"" yet, all of them can be improved enough that people would switch over to a better one. The current top of the line commercial models are hundreds of GB for the weights. To use client inference today you need to use a severely castrated model. Alternatively, if you ship all those hundreds of GB of DRAM on every device, they will be very inefficiently utilized because a single user rarely has the token flow to keep them working, and when they do it's all serial so you can't even batch, you just have to do a linear read over the whole model to get a single token out. And when there's an improved model next year that takes twice the ram you have to roll out whole new machines to the whole fleet.  In contrast, centralized inference can fit as much memory as you put on it, there are no power constraints, you can batch hundreds of requests in one go, and you can update the whole system much more easily. Client inference won't even win in latency because even though you have to pay for network latency, the centralized solution is probably much faster.  The only real advantage client inference has is privacy, and that's not a problem in business, they just get their own inference server. For office work, that even makes latency very fast.",Negative

AMD has done pretty well with it, but it took them years.  PC gaming / PC building hobbyists seem to drastically undervalue how good Intel graphics really are. They're low power, stable, and have sufficient performance to make the entire category of discrete graphics a niche market in PCs.

Intel,Quicksync and power management if I were to guess. Spinning up a dGPU uses a lot of power.,Neutral
Intel,Quick sync on a $150 Intel CPU is better at transcoding then anything Nvidia offers under $600.   A SIGNIFICANT portion of intel sales are because of features like this.

Intel's CEO is a customer-pleaser, so if there's demand for mainstream SKUs w/ RTX, I can't imagine he'll say no. And Nvidia winning more of Intel's business?

Intel,"Thats just more of AMD failing to work with OEMs. Placing a large iGPU tile on a CPU is lower BOM costs than two separate chips with two separate memory pools. And it's easier for OEMs to source a singular chip and cool that single chip.   Strix Halo's failure at using these lower BOM costs to aggressively gain market share, and instead positioning itself as a premium ""high-VRAM"" option is besides the point.

Now the Intel+RTX looks more expensive right by costing 25%? WRONG   Cause if the two laptops are built with exact same components and Intel+ARC laptop costs $1000, the Intel+RTX laptop would cost $1100.  Suddenly the Intel+RTX becomes the obvious choice at only just 10% more money.  It gets worse the higher you. $1500 intel+arc v $1600 Inte+rtx. Or $2000 v $2100  This is also why AMD sucks at OEM and Prebuilts  If a 9060xt built desktop costs $900 the equivalent RTX 5060 Ti desktop would just cost $970.

Intel,Here is the kicker. You didn't need to sub and then buy games.  If you bought a game you can play it without a sub.  But google failed spectacularly to market it that as you didn't even know that.,Negative
Intel,The sub was optional. You could buy a game and play it indefinitely without any extra costs.,Neutral
Intel,"It was good. Not as good GFN cloud gaming but surprisingly good and very playable.  GFN has lower latency than consoles btw on MnK. That's because consoles rely on Bluetooth controllers which adds more latency.  So if anyone is fine is consoles, they will be more than fine on GFN.",Positive

AMD and Nvidia treat drivers like video game releases. They ship at the last possible minute and then need patches a week later for bugs, then they kind of get abandoned.

Intel,">Only if your marketing plan is to sell 0 gpus because who will buy gpu with bad driver and application support?  Good driver and application support is not possible to deliver without a significant install base of your product in the wild. PC configurations vary wildly and usually driver issues are about some bad luck combination of hardware, driver versions, and application versions.  The incumbency advantage in this market is immense. Devs will validate that their stuff works on all manner of configurations including an Nvidia GPU, so they get the perception of having bulletproof drivers.",Negative

Intel,"It's a really good general purpose card. Perhaps not the best card if you want to squeeze out the most fps out of games, but it performs really well in a wide range of tasks including gaming. And yes 12GB VRAM really comes in handy.  It can easily be found for under $250. B580 is still cheaper than 5060 and 9060 XT and even RTX 5050 and RX 7600, especially in the UK where you can find a B570 for only 20 pounds more than RTX 3050. That's way cheaper than RX 6600, it's a no brainer. But the prices could only go down thanks to economy of scale mostly. It's been produced for a while, that's why.  Also one of the big reasons it's still selling now is thanks to good publicity. Imagine if it came out as the same time as RX 9060 XT. HWU would tear a new hole regardless of how much of an improvement it is over the Alchemist cards and the impressive productivity performance.

AutoDesk for example will tell you to go pound sand if you try to get support and you aren't running a workstation GPU with ECC VRAM. So for businesses running AutoDesk software in a professional capacity, or businesses needing SR-IOV, you could offer them a 3090 or a 5070 Ti Super to them for $100 and it still won't be an option for them, because for their needs they might as well be paperweights.",Negative

Intel,"iirc, SR-IOV and VDI support in the coming months, toggleable ECC support, and it is ISV certified",Neutral
Intel,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction. Very important when running 24-48 hour simulations.",Neutral
Intel,Software support is a thing. CAD applications like solidworks and inventor don’t officially support the GeForce rtx or radeon rx line of gpus and they’re considered untested unsupported options.

Intel,"SR-IOV is Virtual GPU (SR-IOV is IO Virtualization used to split PCIe lanes into virtual functions so their physical function can be shared between VMs). No consumer cards support Virtual GPU right now besides Pascal/Turing with driver hacks. AMD's SR-IOV offerings are [very limited](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#virtualization-support), [And Nvidia has a bigger selection](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/gpus-supported-by-vgpu.html) but their budget VGPU options are being phased out (P40).  I believe VDI is Microsoft's implementation. I believe I've done VDI on my RTX 2070 before (I have done seamless sharing between host and VM), but I don't know if it's possible with AMD. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm more familiar with the Linux side / vGPU than VDI.  ECC is Error Correcting RAM. I generally don't understand the use case for ECC either, but it is ubiquitous in HPC. All server boards support ECC RAM.  In modern environments most of these features need 16GB of VRAM minimum, but if you ever wanted to try it on a consumer card, you could get an old RTX 20 series and try it out with some driver mods. Optionally, the P40 is still pretty cheap ($250 used) and doesn't need those hacks at the cost of drawing a lot of power, which Intel has solved with their Battlemage Pro platform (by far the cheapest VRAM/$/W you can get).",Neutral

Intel,"It's needed whenever the work you're doing matters and a single-bit error could cause significant harm.  Something like audio or video, a single-bit error probably isn't very noticeable.  Calculations, it absolutely depends on what you're calculating and which bit gets flipped; flipping the low-order bit in a number might not matter much and flipping the high-order bit could cause a big error.  Networking, it depends on whether the protocols you use have more error checks at a higher level (TCP does; UDP does not).  If in doubt, you want ECC, but market segmentation to mostly restrict ECC support to ""server"" chips and boards and charge more for ECC memory means you'll overpay for it.",Negative

Intel,"The problem with Gaudi (I know, I've written code and run training runs on it) is simply that the programming model is not oneAPI, or whatever oneAPI becomes. Yes, pytorch works, but people care a lot about software longevity and long term vision when buying $5mm+ of GPUs (and these are the purchases Intel cares about that can actually start to offset the cost of development).   The whole purpose behind Falcon Shores (and now Jaguar Shores, if it will even happen) is to put Gaudi performance (i.e. tensor cores) in an Xe-HPC package. Unifying graphics and compute packages is what NVIDIA was able to achieve but not yet AMD, and it's really great for encouraging ML development in oneAPI.

Obviously fixed pass though is an option, but even that isn't without issue. NVIDIA only recently removed the driver restriction, they could add it back at any time. Plus you are limited on virtual machine by the physical GPU count. It works with Intel GPUs and is FOSS with them.  SR-IOV on Intel fixes all of that.

Intel,"LMAO, I actually have quite a bit of knowledge in this area.  If all you care for is VDI for a small number of VMs, then you'd go GPU passthrough. vGPU / MxGPU often requires higher levels of hypervisor software tier (i.e. VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus), requiring more money. For KVM hosts, setting up vGPU is a lot more difficult and time consuming than just straight up GPU passthrough.  Only two groups of people would be interested in GPU virtualization / splitting:  * Enterprise, in which they wouldn't care about the used card prices.  * Enthusiasts, in which they wouldn't want to pay for vGPU prices anyway. So why bother catering to this crowd?",Neutral
Intel,"Full GPU passthrough is not a solution that many people would consider because it is clumsier than using sr-iov (or potentially VirtIO GPU Venus). Plus for each extra passthrough instance I would have to add in another GPU and this greatly increases power consumption, heat output and cooling requirements. The process is not all that much more complicated at least on Turing GPUs with a hacked driver on KVM guests at least. Plus for passthrough, you probably still need an NVIDIA card because last I checked AMD cards still had a random kernel panic issue after being passed through.  My assumption is that sr-iov on the b50 will allow users an affordable way to have multiple guests on one host GPU without increasing power draw and paying for expensive alternatives and expensive vGPU subscriptions.",Negative
Intel,"...first time I heard people prefer SRIOV over GPU passthrough because it's ""clumsier"" lol. I'm sure setting up mdev devices in KVM, finding the correct corresponding GPU instances, making them persistent through reboot, then edit virsh xml for each individual VM is a lot easier than just doing IOMMU passthrough. /s     Again, enthusiasts don't care about power consumption / heat output / cooling requirements for their lab environment. Enterprise that do care about them are very willing to pay extra cost to get a production ready driver. You're creating a hypothetical situation that simply does not exist in the real world.",Neutral

Intel,"The E core having more improvements than just 50% larger L2 is a nice surprise, but damn the efficiency and performance of it is insane. 29% and 22% more performance, at the same power draw is insane, clocking like 6.7% higher too. They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown. As that can probably handle like another extra watt of heat and performance. Battery life is very nice, the fact that it can match other phones with like over 1000mAh bigger battery is funny. As people always flexing over how they have like a 4000, 5000mAh+ battery, of course having a bigger capacity is better, but the fact that Apple is more efficient with it and can have the same battery life at a much smaller battery speaks volumes about it.",Positive
Intel,"The occupancy characteristics of A19 Pro are quite incredible. 67% occupancy for a RT workload.  Look at Chips and cheese's SER testing. 36-44% ray occupancy with SER in Cyberpunk 2077 RT Overdrive.     Assuming NVIDIA can get this working on 60 series an effective a 52-86% uplift. After OMM and SER this seems like the third ""low hanging"" RT fruit optimization. Anyone serious about a PT GPU architecture NEEDs dynamic caching like Apple. And no this is not RDNA 4's Dynamic VGPR, it's a much bigger deal. Register file directly in L1$ has unique benefits.",Positive
Intel,"Nice been waiting for this. P-core frontend improvements and branch, and a wider E-core with it's newer memory subsystem shows great YoY gains as usual. Though I am not surprised since it's been years leading up to this that Apple has steadily have been increasing power/freq to get the rest of it's performance gains, although IPC YoY is still class leading. The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that. The base iPhone 17 looks like a reaaly reallly good option, more than ever, wished they didn't drop the Plus model. But man, I feel like waiting another year, hearing rumours about N2 and new packaging tech excites me.  That said, looking forward to QC, MT, and Samsung.

Intel,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.  Its either Qualcomm or Apple. AMD is too far behind Oryon and Apple's uarchs. They consume similar or even more area for their core architecture while lagging in performance while using significantly more power. The x86 ecosystem and compatibility is the only reason they'd survive Oryon.",Neutral
Intel,Having so many SoC makers on arm competing against each other by one upping each other yearly is bearing fruit vs x86. i don't know how Intel and AMD long term can fare at this rate. Arm CPUs are still showing double digit gains yearly.,Neutral
Intel,Most of apples RT gains are from optmsiing how the GPU deals with divergence.  This is not dedicated RT silicon so much as making the GPU be able to maintain much higher throughput when there is lots of divergence.  RT operations have a shit tone of divergence.,Negative
Intel,I can't wait to see die shots and measurements for these chips. The A18 Pro and A18 die shots were really interesting to see what was compacted or lost for the base model chip. I have a feeling that there will be bigger differences for the A19 Pro and A19 with that giant SLC on the former. Die areas will also be interesting. Cache isn't cheap for area and I'd also love to see inside the new E-cores and GPU.,Positive
Intel,">Growing the E core into a medium core is really important and something I was worried apple might miss out on, but this means they should be able to keep up in multicore as trends point to flooding CPUs with E cores.  I wouldn't say its a medium core yet tbh. Apple's E cores are still sub 1mm2 in area usage. Compared to other ""M cores"" they are still relatively small. I imagine the A19 Pro E core is fairly larger but the A18 E core was around 0.6/0.7mm2 in size. I'd imagine its not grown a whole lot.  >They really ~~buried~~ deleted the lede by not even mentioning the E core improvements beyond the cache and undersold the GPU.

Intel,> just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  When you take a look at GPUs doing RT task you see that they tend to be very poorly utilized.  GPUs are not designed for short running diverging workloads. But RT is exactly that. So you end up with a huge amount of divergence and or lots of wave like submissions of very small batches of work (so have a large scheduling overhead).     There is a HUGE amount of perfomance left on the table for this type of task for HW vendors that are able to reduce the impact on GPU utilization that divergence has.,Negative

Of course this is not as impressive because those are desktop chips which draw 100W+, and there have been historically gaps between desktop and laptop chips in ST for AMD (even though laptop technically had the TDP to sustain ST).  M2 and Zen 4 launched around the same period. The desktop chips score around 5-10% faster in Geekbench while using 20W per core power and 30-40W more for the I/O die. Taking the ST crown by a hair's width while using 5-10x more power isn't a win at all imo.",Neutral
Intel,">Considering Zen 5 is designed to clock way higher, I don't think it's that bad really.   I'd agree if they performed as well as their clocks suggest. Whats the point of clocking to 5.7Ghz if a mobile CPU clocked at 4.4Ghz leads you in absolute performance by 15% (Geekbench) while using a tenth of the total power.",Neutral
Intel,This snapdragon era is Microsoft's third time trying arm (windows rt and surface pro x). Hopefully third times the charm,Positive
Intel,Their E-core is faster than something like Tiger lake per clock. It’s about 60-70% as fast as the best desktop CPU from 2020 and probably as fast as a U-series chip from then under sustained loads.  The real takeaway for me is that the rumored A19 MacBook is going to dominate the $600 laptop market segment if it releases before Christmas.,Positive
Intel,"Weirdly enough, I feel like them not letting the E core balloon in size has helped them in the long run. Seems they're focussed on maximizing performance within a limited area. Their E cores have had exceptional jumps in performance since the A12 almost every generation being 25%+ in improvements.  I'd wager that E core dominance is the primary reason why the iPhones are able to match Android manufacturers using super large and dense batteries in terms of endurance.",Positive

Intel,Its a bit unlikely. Maybe for a version of the M series dedicated for a Mac Pro. But one of the main reasons they can get away with this design is because its very scalable.

Intel,"the shader re-ordering is different. (apple also do this).  Even with shader re-ordering you have the issue that you're still issuing 1000s of very small jobs.    GPUs cant do lots of small jobs, they are designed to do the same task to 1000s of pixels all at once.     If  you instead give them 1000 tasks were each pixel does something differnt the GPU cant run that all at the same time... in addition the overhead for setup and teardown of each of these adds even more void space between them.   So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",Neutral
Intel,"While RT does have lots of branching logic (and CPUs are much better at dealign with this) you also want to shader the result when a ray intercepts, and this is stuff GPUs are rather good at (if enough rays hit that martial)   We have had CPU RT for a long time and so long as you constrain the martial space a little GPUs these days, even with all the efficiency  loss are still better at it.   (there are still high end films that opt for final render on cpu as it gives them more flexibility in the shaders they use) but for a game were it is all about fudging it GPUs are orders of magnitude faster, you just have so much more fp compute throughput on the GPU even if it is running at 20% utilization that is still way faster than any cpu.",Positive
Intel,"Its not just useful for RT but also for a lot of other situations, being able to just call out to functions on the GPU and not pay a HUGE divergence penalty (you still pay some) opens up GPU compute to a load more cases were we currently might not bother.",Neutral
Intel,I'm a bit confused. You think lagging 15% behind in P/W the competition for an entire year is not being a generation behind?  ARM themselves have managed only a 15% jump this year. So it will essentially be 2 years before we get an E core that matches the A19 pro. And this is just considering the Xiomi's SoC. Mediatek's and Qualcomm's which dominate the majority of the market lag even further behind.,Negative

Intel,"I agree to some degree; Geekerwan notes they are testing mainboard power, not core power (if you Google Translate their legend).  For me, I assume all the major power draws on the motherboard *are* contributing to the overall SPEC performance, too.   If the faster LPDDR5X-9600 in the A19 Pro eats more power, it's fair to include that power because ***all*** A19 Pros will ship with LPDDR5X-9600. That was Apple's choice to upgrade to this faster memory.    Now, you're very right: we can't purely blame the uArch at Apple. It may well be the DRAM or the boost algorithms (like we saw at the A18 Pro launch last year) and—at Apple specifically—even the marketing overlords.  It's also why I'm a big proponent of JEDEC speeds & timings & volts in desktop CPU tests, much to the chagrin of a few commenters.",Neutral

Intel,"While the efficiency for this is BAD, I dont think its 20W per core.  When we look at results by [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-zen4-zen4c-scaling/2) we can see \~7-8W per core for this (not great numbers, because its a weird chip and different node), which is still very bad. AMD certainly has some power issues, but many of which, i.e. inefficient I/O dies, are not really dependent on the CPU uArch and could switch at any moment. They certainly have much more inefficient chips at the moment than both Apple and Qualcomm. For Zen 6 we expect a major update to the desktop chiplet architectur which could bring some much needed improvements in terms of I/O though.  They have reasonably fast cores, and I think they are not in a terrible position, even though it is far from good. I think what is interesting for AMD to look out for is that they keep moving fast, instead of intel who didnt move fast since like 14nm, and AMD has strong cores. Additionally AMD has (including from the datacenter) an enterprise need to make the CPUs more efficient.  So yeah, very bad CPUs efficiency wise. A bit behind, but not terribly on perf per node wise, efficiency on the desktop is an afterthought for AMD, clearly, but they are moving constantly and are improving. It might be AMD Laptop Zen 6 has again like 35W TDP, for 3000 Geekbench and be dead, but with some client oriented tweaks I see chances (maybe just from the patterns in the tea leaves in my mug)",Negative

Intel,Apparently Cinebench 2024 GPU is not compatible with RDNA4 cards lol. So I can't find any scores to compare.,Negative
Intel,"So does dynamic caching ensure that the total size will ""always"" be the same as whats being called? As in certain cases it is still possible that there can be wastage like for the example you said ""Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers. But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time."" on that, there would be 10 registers wasted doing nothing, if it cant find any else thats <10 registers to fit in that.",Neutral
Intel,Yeah you're right. Should've said branchy or low occupancy code.  Combining such a HW side change with change on SW side with GPU work graphs API could indeed open up many usecases and new possibilities that are well beyond the current way of doing things. I can't wait to see what Apple does when Work Graphs arrives in a future Metal release.,Neutral
Intel,"Well when you put it like that (13-14% behind in efficiency) saying ""generations behind"" certainly sounds misleading.

Intel,"It's not ""generation**s**"" behind as you originally wrote. It's being compared to cores from **a year ago** already, mate.

Intel,"Because we don’t have the tools. On macOS Apple provides powermetrics but Apple states that the figures can’t necessarily be relied on.

Intel,one will think the massive vram capacity just override the disadvantages.,Neutral
Intel,"dynamic caching would let more copies of the shader run given that is knows the chances that every copy hits that point were it needs 30 registers is very low.   If that happens then one of those threads is then stalled but the other thing it can do is dynamicly at runtime convert cache, and thread local memroy to registers and vice versa.   So what will happen first is some data will be evicted from cache and those bits will be used as registers.   maybe that shader has a typical width of just 5 registers and only in some strange edge case goes all the way up to 30.

Intel,"Yeah, I guess that wasn't clear. What I meant is that the IPC of the E-core is so much higher than Tiger Lake that it's performance at 2.6GHz is surprisingly close to desktop Tiger Lake at 5GHz.  I know it's not fair to compare with Intel 10nm (later Intel 7) with TSMC N3P as it's 2 major nodes apart, but this goes way beyond that because these chips are using only around 2.5w for just the E-cores. TSMC claimed 25-30% power savings from N7 to N5 and another 30-35% from N5 to N3.  Using these numbers, we get these 4 E-cores using somewhere around 6-7w PEAK, but this is all-core turbo. Intel's CPU at it's most efficient 12w configuration won't hit it's 4.4GHz turbo required to win in single-core performance and is going to hit closer to its 1.2GHz base clock in all-core sustained performance at which point the E-cores not only have their giant IPC advantage, but double the clockspeed too.

Intel,"Reordering of shaders has a cost, if for a given martial you just hit 10 rays you will not want to dispatch that shader with just 10 instances as the cost of dispatch and scdulaing will be higher than just inlining the evaluation, so you will merge together the low frequency hits into a single wave were you then use branching/fuction point calls.    You will also use this mixed martial uber shader to use up all the dregs that do not fit within a SMD group.      Eg you might have 104 rays hit a martial but that martial shader can only fit 96 threads into a SIMD group so has 8 remaining thread, you don't want to just dispatch these on there own as that will have very poor occupancy (with 88 threads worth of compute ideal) so you instead inline them within a uber shader along with a load of other overflow.",Neutral

Intel,the 3060 is still a better value than this card bc its about same speed but 12gb vram and higher bus,Positive
Intel,"Maybe a product for non-gamers who want/need multiple display setup, like me. Even then, if you bother to spend that amount of money for 5050, better add some more to get 5060, and if bother to get 5060 just better get 16GB one. Furthermore, you may feel why not add bit more to get 5070 series rather than 5060 16GB. That's how these things are priced.",Neutral

Intel,Humiliation for the RTX 5050 is well deserved. It's good this gets curb stomped by the Intel B580.  More market share for Intel because AMD also introduced a useless 8 GB card.,Positive
Intel,">128 bit bus  Seems like this isn't the main issue with 5050's performance. 4060 has lowest memory bandwidth out of all 3, yet it's the fastest card. The die is just too cut down.",Negative
Intel,Unfortunately it will still sell like hotcakes in pre-builts to people who don't know much about computers.,Negative

Intel,"I just looked at PCPartPicker and the cheapest B580 on there, in the US, is $299 (and the brand is Onix). The Intel Limited Edition is $340.

Intel,"Where I live none of the main sellers stock the B580, a round of applause for Intel.  The B580 isn't faster on the CPU's owned by the people who are in the market of a budget GPU.

Intel,"> with lower performance,  even on lower end cpu? Holy crap nvidia wtf",Negative
Intel,Because it will sell a shit load. Probably will be one of the highest selling Nvidia GPUs this generation,Negative
Intel,"At these small die sizes, yields can be really high. High enough that if they wanted to have supply for a 5050, they might not have enough GB206 dies that can be cut down to 20/36 SMs.  The 5060M is probably catching the bulk of the bottom-level GB206 dies at 26/36.  There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory. And I'd agree. But I'm sadly not anybody who can make that decision.  Personally, I can't wait to see what becomes of the cut-down GB207s. The 5050 is a ""golden"" fully-enabled die. There will be some with only 18, or 16, or even fewer working SMs. Hell it could lose an entire GPC and be down to half-working. Those will be some absolutely sad little GPUs.",Neutral
Intel,> It's also a 50 series card that costs $250.  I'll believe that when I see it in stock for 250. MSRP is meaningless if the product isn't available for that price.,Neutral
Intel,And will be even worse since it's vram is 8gb. In many many games the b580 would Perform even better,Negative
Intel,Yeah it would be interesting to test with a more real-world CPU pairing.,Positive
Intel,"Yeah, that was my question, did that ever get fixed? It seems like nobody remembers that anymore",Negative
Intel,"TBH, they should have made THIS card a 75W SKU. It probably easily can be, without losing much performance. That would make it a very viable upgrade path for low-end systems. And kind of make the price more attractive, because it would require zero additional changes.",Positive
Intel,Margins go crazy,Neutral

Intel,They're using the same cpu for the 5050 too. What a weird comment to make.,Negative
Intel,"Don’t forget how everyone is shitting on the 5050, calling it the worst nvidia card ever, but were praising intel non stop for the b580.  Even using purely stats from the article, b580 is 3% better with 4gb more VRAM than “worst gpu ever”, so I don’t see how this translates to a win for the b580. Being better than a terrible product by a hair doesn’t exactly make it good.",Negative
Intel,Same can be said for the 5050 no? Both have CPU overheads unlike AMD which any mid-range AMD GPU can easily outperform Nvidia's 5090 at 1080p.   The 12GB VRAM however are better suited for people who are stuck at older Gen3/Gen4 PCIE speeds.,Neutral
Intel,"It'll run nearly every game in existence at 1080p with playable framerates with the right settings. IDK why it would be a product for non-gamers. Calling it that means the B580, 4060 and 7600 are products for non-gamers, too.  Only game I could think of it wouldn't run properly would be oblivion remastered, which has terrible performance on anything.",Negative
Intel,3050 released with the exact same specs and msrp. The 70w variant only came out 2 years after. The first variant was in top 10 of steam's hardware chart.,Neutral
Intel,"This is not a card for 1440p, as it would have issues with getting even 60 fps there, and in 1080p 8gb is mostly enough.  There is a difference between choking on VRAM with 80 base fps (5060ti) and 50 base fps (5050). Yes, second case is still annoying, but you might want to dial down the settings anyway, and then you would be fine.",Negative
Intel,Nvidia RX7600? That a new GPU? 😂,Neutral
Intel,"Funnily enough the 8gb 9060 XT is the best brand-new alternative at $300 and below, hands-down, and that includes the B580. It's x16 interface means it's less restricted by the vram compared to the 5060/Ti 8gb. The B580 still has overhead issues, VR issues, game issues and is rarely available at MSRP.  But people trash it anyway and praise the B580 without actually looking at its performance. In the benchmark linked by the OP alone it loses to the 4060 lol",Positive
Intel,"Performance is fine I'm sure it'll perform just as good as the 3060 maybe slightly if you lower the power to 75W, call it a 5030 and sell it for $150. But these are different times and Nvidia doesn't do reasonable things like that anymore.  Bottom line, it's just the price and TDP that sucks.",Neutral

It's so bad that even the prebuilts with the 16GB 9060XT will be outsold by prebuilts with a 5050 at the same price range, as companies like to pair trash GPUs with ""high"" end CPUs like a 13700F to clear stock but the ""i7"" allows them to mark up the price.",Negative

Intel,The 12 GB of RAM in the B580 will age more gracefully for a truly low end gamers. On purpose of 8 gb is retro gaming.,Neutral
Intel,"Hate to be that guy but to call this a 30-class card is insane. The 1030 was 25% the performance of the 1060, and the 1630 was around 45% the performance of the 1660. This card is 80% the performance of a 5060, which should probably be called the 5050.  To take it a step further, the GT 1030 was 13% of the 1080ti, the 5050 is 20% of the 5090. The 1050 was 25% of the 1080ti, so it would be reasonable to call this a 5040 or I could even be satisfied with 5040ti.",Neutral
Intel,That would be an interesting card,Positive
Intel,I think a big thing about prebuilts are the aesthetics. Does it look good? is the cables managed? Is the RGB controllable?  Slapping a PC together is easy but building something that looks beautiful through the side panel is not as easy.,Neutral
Intel,The 4060 is 2% and DLSS did plenty of work for the even slower 3060. DLSS is going to be great for this card. Frame gen will be good in games this card can run at good base framerates.,Positive

Intel,"I'm looking into this now, and you are correct. I am just reading this for the first time.",Neutral
Intel,Lol no. For truly low-end gamers the B580 will perform worse because of its CPU overhead that still hasn't been fixed more than half a year after release.,Negative
Intel,"I mean not really. The b580 is low end enough to the point where it'll become obsolete in performance long before it runs out of VRAM.  It's the equivalent of saying buying a 16gb 7600xt in 2025 is ""more futureproof"" than buying a 12gb 3060 in 2025.",Negative
Intel,an 8 GB card is obsolete at day one for modern games.,Neutral
Intel,"It's not about the performance vs XX60. It's about the CUDA core count and bandwith vs biggest die in the lineup. You can find those numbers on Gamer's nexus latest shrinkflation video on this topic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caU0RG0mNHg). Considering those things, the 5060 is essentially a 5050 and the 5050 is a 5030.  The GT 730 had 13.3% as many cores as the full GK110 die, with a 50W TDP.  The GT 1030 had around 10.3% as many cores as the full GP102 die, with a 30W TDP though this one was impressive.  The GXT 1630 had around 11% as many cores as full TU102 die, with exactly 75W TDP.  The RTX 5050 has 10.7% as many cores as the full GB202 die (RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell), and around 11.7% vs the 5090 (which is the number you'll se on Gamer's Nexus video, he rounds it up to 12%, I think that was a mistake on his part? I'm not gonna try and correct him though), but it has a TDP of 130W somehow, just 15W less than the 5060, that's absurd.  Hence why I'm saying it SHOULD be a sub 75W TDP card, and priced way below that. My theory is that it was OC'ed past its efficiency curve to make it at least moderately better than the 3060 and still be able to call it a XX50 card.",Neutral

When it comes to die size the top Pascal card is closer to the 5080 than 5090.",Negative
Intel,The point is more VRAM =/= aging better. The b580 having 12gb isn't saving it from becoming obsolete in a few years.,Negative
Intel,"They re not the same price tier either bro... They could have called the 5090 a 5095ti if that makes you happier.  The guy you quoted is right.   Also comparing the performance diff between the 1030 vs 1060 because guess what the 5060 should have been the 5050 looking at die size and memory bus.   Not sure why people keep defending these naming schemes, do you think the engineers use them internally lol? Its bullshit that marketing comes up with",Negative
Intel,"Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍 Doesn't matter if die sizes get bigger, that's up to Nvidia. Just because the halo product got bigger doesn't mean they can get away with moving their product stack (below the XX90) one tier up in prices.   I guess it is a dog shit methodology to use, only Gamer's Nexus uses it and I'm sure #1 Nvidia apologist u/Alive_Worth_2032 knows more than him.   It's a shit methodology to use if you love conformism and shrinkflation in GPUs, I agree.  And it's a shit methodology to use if you're an Nvidia executive.  If you can't see that Nvidia is putting all the effort into binning high end chips for AI cause it's 90% of their income, then I don't know what to tell you. Obviously it's a good move for them, and it works, but there's 0 reason for a gaming customer to defend them for it. We used to get much more out of their chips in the gaming cards for more reasonable prices, why's it wrong to want that?   You can't just draw a conclusion based on relative performance between 2 underpowered products, you compare them to the ""best"" Nvidia COULD give us (which is the full top die for each generation) and go down from there.  Edit: just look at the 3090/ti and how the chips were proportionally fine still compared to it and that die was 628mm^2. That's not even an excuse.",Neutral
Intel,"> It's a shit methodology to use if you love conformism and shrinkflation in GPUs, I agree. And it's a shit methodology to use if you're an Nvidia executive.  You can chose one methodology.   You can decide on comparing what hardware you get at a certain price point.   Or you can ignore price/bom and look only at arbitrary model numbers as if they mean something.  You cannot do both at the same time.  Personally I prefer to look at die area. The 5050 today is roughly comparable to the 1050 Ti, comparing it to the top cards that are not comparable is irrelevant.  Pascal did not have a analogue for the 5090, period.  >Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍  That changes nothing. The Pascal Titan are using the same die as the 1080 Ti. The whole tier of die that is used in today's consumer top SKUs and for the RTX 6000 Blackwell, DID NOT EXIST back then.  >Edit: just look at the 3090/ti and how the chips were proportionally fine still compared to it and that die was 628mm2. That's not even an excuse.  What are you even trying to say? Ampere also did not have a analogue to the 5090. The 3090 Ti, even it is sitting almost a tier below the 5090. The 2080 Ti and 5090 are unmatched in other generations.",Negative
Intel,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear. What I don't agree with is using the die area excuse to justify shrinkflation just because the 5090 is such a halo product.",Neutral
Intel,"> So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  Do you even listen to your own madness?  You realize that what you are saying. Is that the lower end 5000 series would be ""better"". If Nvidia removed the 5090 entirely. And renamed the 5080 the 5080 Ti, and made the 5070 Ti into the new 5080.  Suddenly, you would praise the lower end cards for being ""better"". Purely because the high end is less powerful. Nothing else changed, no one is getting more hardware for their money.  Jesus Christ the mental gymnastics you people go trough.   The hardware Nvidia gives you for your money, is all that matters.

I don't think it has anything to do with AI it's been like this  forever.  AMD is nice consumer hardware that they just don't provide the tools to use in any advanced capacity.",Negative
Intel,"i thought nvidia grid got semi replaced by MIG. then again, MIG is only supported only on a specific subset of datacentre cards.",Neutral
Intel,"Hyper-V supports GPU partitioning without the need for SR-IOV, which is almost perfect on nvidia cards (at least for what I need). It doesn't support VRAM partitioning though, so every VM has full access to all of the VRAM. It also disables checkpoints for the VM (or at least says it does, apparently there's a way around this), and doesn't support dynamic RAM allocation.  In my limited use of other brands of GPU, it has some infrequent but major bugs with AMD IGPUs and frequent but minor bugs with Intel IGPUs (I've never tried a dedicated card from either brand with Hyper-V).",Neutral
Intel,"I think the future way around is to make the vm look like any other application from the gpu drivers point of view. On Linux (both host and guest for now) there exists virtio native, but for now it only works on Amd and is still in Beta and not yet really well documented how to get it working.",Neutral

Intel,Surprised AMD just acted like Nvidia while Intel is the one actually doing this for so much GPU stuff.,Negative
Intel,The problem is they're not super available either,Negative
Intel,"PCIe Passthrough is not the same as GPU splitting. All 3 have support for PCIe Passthrough. I use it all of the time. The main goal of SR-IOV is to remove the need for multi-GPU setups in virtualization which from a market segmentation point would be detrimental to profits at the consumer level because a host may only need 1-4GB of VRAM and the rest can be allocated to the guests. This would be very impactful in ""Prosumer"" markets where someone may need more than 2 GPU outputs (typical for iGPUs) but may not want a multi-GPU setup as a multi-GPU setup has higher power draw.",Neutral

Intel,TLDR:    Geomean: RX 9060 XT 16GB is 46% faster (mixed settings).     Raw performance closer to 30-40% faster.          Cheapest RX 9060 XT 16GB in EU is ~400 euros (VAT included)     Cheapest Arc B580 12GB in EU is ~294 euros (VAT included),Positive
Intel,Does the B580 still suffer from the massive CPU overhead or was is ever fixed?  Considering that noone reasonable will pair something like a 9800X3D with a B580 something like a 7600 or even 5600 or 5700X3D this is something a lot of people would have to keep in mind when it comes significantly worse on the kind of CPUs you would actually see in a budget build.,Negative

Intel,I own both. The 9060xt is better use of money.,Positive
Intel,hot take   intel arc b580 is a better value then the 9060xt 16gb reason   your going entry level gpu   9060xt is a weird spot because if you can find at retail 9070 smashes it at 100 150$ more it makes it EXTREMELY HARD TO SUGGEST YES some people supposendly cant afford the extra 100 150 (although its very very likely not off the bad just a extra month of work or so) especially when your going entry you can argue fps is higher but my argument is 250$ for a 12gb gpu that competes properly against what its trying to compete against the 4060 while the 9060xt is a messy pricing and i also argue no one wants to give intel a realistic chance which is another issue if more people gave intel a chance i fondly believe it would be great for most people,Negative
Intel,"Question is:  They have a deal in few days where i can get BF6 free with intel GPU. It's a game i would have bought anyway so it's like getting a 90$CA off the GPU price    Currently, i can get a Arc B580 for 360$CA which would mean an effective price of 270$CA. A 9060 XT, the cheapest comes at 490$CA (but it's on sale right now so the real cheapest would be 540$CA).   At this theorical price, i guess i can't go wrong with the intel one right? I will pair it with a Ryzen 7 5800x probably.   I'm currently running a Ryzen 7 1800x and a GTX 1070ti and playing at 1440p and i really don't care about running 4K ultra.

Intel,"Yes, but as he says in the video, there are some major outliers in the results due to things like Vram going past 12GB, and certain games just not liking Arc GPUs. Looks like a more ""typical result"" is 30% to 40% faster when not going over 12GB VRAM and not in a game that Arc has issues with.

Intel,"have a b580 and 9800x3d combo, and am perfectly happy with it. it even does some 4k gaming stuff just fine.",Positive
Intel,"As long as the zen3 era CPU can hit 58gps average and 46fps 1% lows in whatever game you are referring to, then it would make no difference vs having the 9800x3d. You only see a difference if the CPU frame times take longer to compute than the GPU frame times.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, as someone trying to build a new PC for 1080p/1440p it makes no sense to go for the 9060xt since the 5060 Ti is only slightly more expensive and gets me the new DLSS, better ray tracing, etc. I guess for pure raster performance one could also include the 7800xt but it's not as ""future proof"" that's for sure.",Neutral

Intel,I’m in your shoes. I just bought my B580 with the Intel bundle for BF6. I have a Ryzen 5 3700X and tbh i’m not super super impressed with how much tinkering and adjustment is needed to get the Arc card to run “properly”. I’ve only had mine for a few days so hard to justify but i’m on edge of returning it possibly.   It seems every game is a hit or miss on how it runs and by saving only $100ish dollars i’m starting to think it’s not worth it. Don’t get me wrong majority of my games are running fine but the few that are inconsistent it’s like was this really worth it?  TLDR; Card is a hit or miss with the game you play. IMO spend the extra $ and get a reliable card from NVIDIA or AMD and feel secure,Negative

Intel,I would rather take the 5060 and play with lower textures than the b580 and be cpu bottlenecked with driver issues and no DLSS.,Negative
Intel,"You still aren't saying which test you are referring to, so my answer has to say general rather than specific, but you seem to not fully understand how this works. If the CPU computes the frame faster than the GPU, then an even faster CPU will not improve the frame time. If in this particular test a lower end CPU could not compute the frame faster than the GPU, then the faster CPU is helping. But a faster CPU does not always make a difference. It only matters if the weaker one is actually limiting the performance, which is often not the case.",Negative
Intel,"HUB tested very thoroughly and even did a follow up video about it because some russian tech site called HUB liars.

There are many AI cases where the 48GB card is going to trounce any offering from nVidia, and every card Intel sells to AI folk is one more nVidia card available to gamers.   So whether or not you are personally interested in buying a B60, it IS going to be a crazy important card to gamers because this is going to permanently shift the supply/demand for nVidia cards as well as force nVidia to start increasing vram to compete.  Bonus, because Intel has their own foundries, the upcoming celestial line will not be competing with nVidia for foundry time, so this will also increase the total number of video cards produced!",Neutral

I mean the original Xe produced on TSMC under Raja is certainly gone but feels like they've re-calibated with Xe3P quite a bit.  Honestly if Xe3P performs \*very\* well in labs I'd do a N44>N48 style die upscaling of a probable 256-bit part they're working on and just double the spec of it. If it still struggles in gaming Vs RTX 60 & UDNA/RDNA5/GFX14 PPA wise then they can just reuse said dies for AI easily. Especially could fill in the gap left by Falcon Shores to an extent.

Intel,This is shit. Hopefully they still make the mid range 700 series. I was sort of holding out for that but it's taking too long.,Negative
Intel,"This does suggest that Intel GPU unit will likely get the axe.  It also suggests that ARM doesn't have the HPC ability of x86.  ARM was half as fast, at the same power, as AMD EPYC.

Intel,B580 is significantly slower on weaker cpus like your i5. Get a 9060xt,Negative
Intel,Neither. Get used if those are your only new options. 8gb is not enough for a new card and Intel GPUs are e-waste and are plagued with driver issues.

Intel,"Looks like you hit the nail on the head for a budget ddr5 gaming system, maximising performance per dollar IMO.   You could try a 9060 xt, to get 16gb of vram to help give your GPU more legs to play longer since a 7500f should still be well suited for that GPU. It is likely about $100 more though.   I see nothing wrong with this build for what your assumed goal is, you could probably squeeze more out of your budget with a different mobo, case, and cooler and upgrade the GPU at most and stay in budget.",Positive

Intel,"you can shave of like $25 off the SSD with a 2tb $100 SDD instead. You can also shave 17$ off the cooler by getting a regular assassin instead of the double radiator version, since you don't need a double radiator to cool the 7500f. And you can save money on the power supply by opting for a 650w supply instead. Gives you plenty of wattage overhead as well.

Intel,"buy a better gpu because it sounds like you're really only interested in playing games at max fidelity, so a good GPU will take you way further than any monitor currently can. IMO, a good/great monitor should be the last thing that you get because if max frames is the goal, it's smarter to see where your personal cutoff is (in regards to resolution/fidelity with your current setup) and whether or not you're really wanting to buy pricier hardware to max out your current monitor or upgrade to a monitor with higher specs or a different panel type like W/QD-OLED",Positive
Intel,I mean in short i have 2 choises intel arc B580 and QD/W-Oled monitor or Rtx 5070/5060 ti and a normal not good not bad monitor but is the monitor worth it? cause im not sure is an OLEd that big of an diffrence,Neutral
Intel,"There is definitely a noticeable difference between a nice IPS panel monitor and a QD/W-OLED monitor, there's absolutely no debating this. But where objectivity ends, subjection begins and this is where your personal standards come into play. For me personally, growing up playing games on low resolution CRT monitors, I only care that I can play my games of choice, so I would personally be happy with a decent IPS monitor because the games won't care if I'm playing on a nice monitor or not, but they will care what hardware I'm playing on. So I would go with the 5070/60 Ti and a decent monitor. The B580 will struggle more with a nicer OLED panel anyway due to the more demanding specs.",Neutral
Intel,A B580 won't be able to properly show off such a nice monitor because it will run so slowly and you won't be able to turn the graphics settings up.,Negative

Intel,"Everybody was talking about it when it came out. At MSRP, it’s a good value   It was just a bitch to get because it sold out instantly everywhere. I’m sure that’s changed now. It’s a good purchase   It also requires a decent CPU, that’s the only issue",Positive
Intel,They make up something like 2% of the total GPU market.  You don't see a lot of talk about them because so few have them.  They are ok for what they are.,Positive
Intel,They’re really good for what they are and are pretty universally well received.   They’re budget tier cards with a limited lineup that simply don’t have the same recognition and acclaim as Nvidia or AMD.,Positive
Intel,"The Intel arc GPUs used to be avoided because of the drivers. Some games straight up don't work with them, some had way worst performance than the competitions. Intel's driver has improved leaps and bounds, it's a great one to get unless you have a really dated CPU.",Negative
Intel,"I just got one and it’s awesome, $395 AU and I got a nice increase at 1080p. Made it very cheap to upgrade!   I think my end game is to try get the next line of graphics card at early retail price, or just hop on the next Intel… tbh done me great. The only problem I have had so far was tabbing out of helldivers caused a few glitches on my mates end for the 15 seconds I was gone.",Positive
Intel,"Their A series gpus had some major issues alongside drivers still being pretty raw. The a310/380/580 have some niche uses in video encoding or for driving 1080p displays.   The B series cards have turned out to be really good budget gpus for 1080/1440p. The drivers have come a long way since launch, theyre still not as refined as Nvidia but theyre mostly stable now. They both require more modern platforms to perform well but not the top end hardware alot of reviews claim they need. The b580 has had alot of issues staying in stock since it offers 12gb of vram at a price point that almost exclusively offers 8gb cards.  Ive had my b580 since around launch. I got it on launch day for MSRP and aside from an unstable driver update i had to roll back its been a great upgrade from the 1070 i had previously. If you play on 1080/1440p displays at high settings theyre good cards",Neutral

Intel,No they aren’t. The b580 in particular is praised for its great value at its price range,Positive
Intel,As long as your CPU and motherboard supports RE-Bar it's a great option for 1080p/1440p for the price,Positive
Intel,Idk but I take it as a good sign because people will only post if there is something wrong with the product. This also applies to other subreddits.,Neutral
Intel,"They're good and I have one that I use for a rig that only plays games like esport titles and multiplayer steam games. They aren't the best for any type of AAA game.  The bigger deal is that intel has announced some pretty heavy changes and cuts coming and there is good speculation that intel's gpu sector might be cut. If it doesn't happen, it's no big deal, but if it does get cut or restricted, any type of updates or driver updates that are needed for future releases will probably be unlikely to come out. That's probably the only reason I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but for the price its great for someone who only enjoys current multiplayer games or indie games.",Neutral
Intel,"Intel Arc has physical hardware that works ok, but it's not high performance yet.  But MOST importantly, this is a new company in terms of graphics drivers and industry cooperation in software development. So what? NVIDIA and AMD partner with game developers to optimize graphics, sample and super-sample textures in AI for optimization for best performance. This is an ongoing development of specialized software and tools to improve performance to the maximum with the given hardware. This software is NOT available to Intel and they will have to spend years catching up to their competition.  In short, Intel graphics cards will work fine for low demand popular programs. They may eventually get there for high end performance, but it will take years for them to catch up.",Positive
Intel,"Have you considered 9060 xt at all? There has been a price decrease recently, you might be able to get one for the same price as a b580 (8gb model 9060 xt).  Except for the vram department, the 9060 xt is pretty much better in every way and performs better too.  Was on the same boat with you. The b580 was $360 CAD, and the 9060 xt 8gb was $380. After going through countless benchmarks (especially at 1440p), I eventually decided to pick the 9060 xt sapphire.   In only like 1 or 2 games the b580 scored higher, and everything else was in 9060 xt’s favour. Idk much about the driver issues on the b580, but at least the 9060 xt seemed like the safer bet. I wish it was at least 10gb though…. Amd really missed an opportunity. Otherwise this gpu is a beast! I’ve never seen an 8gb gpu do so well at 1440p. Amd did score with that.",Positive
Intel,They are good for 1080p gaming also if you have a really low budget and want to game. For slightly more money you can pick up a 9060xt 16gb which is good for 1440p and has better long term returns.,Positive
Intel,"They're okay, if you hate yourself get an Intel Arc GPU otherwise get an AMD Radeon GPU or if you have the money to burn literally and figuratively speaking an Nvidia GPU.",Neutral
Intel,I think better price to performance can be found on a used card.,Neutral
Intel,"Has driver issues with more dated and/or less popular games, but they've made it a point that major AAA titles and esports games usually have good drivers. It also basically requires a fairly beefy CPU and it will at least slightly negatively impact the CPU performance too. But when I say fairly beefy I basically just mean AM4 5000 series or basically any AM5 CPU even the 7500f, I personally don't know the Intel comparison but I imagine any Core Ultra or 12th gen would absolutely crush it and be fine.  But the B580 is basically competing in the 60 series tier and is alright, but definitely if you can get it for MSRP or within I'd say even $30 over MSRP it's a steal. Something of note too is at least from my experience and seeing benchmarks, the Arc GPUs normally do this split the middle kind of thing, where they tend to outraster/render Nvidia GPUs of their tier, but get outrastered/rendered by AMD GPUs of their tier, but on the other end XeSS upscaling/frame gen performance and raytracing usually outperforms the comparable AMD GPUs, but loses to the comparable Nvidia GPUs. Although FSR4 and the better raytracing on the 9000 series might've changed that, a lot of those comparisons were from when we were still comparing to the RTX4000 and RX7000 cards.",Neutral
Intel,B series is getting a bit old now. Eagerly awaiting what the C series will bring.,Neutral
Intel,No idea about the drivers but B570 and B580 which released some months ago are very good value and also very efficient.,Positive
Intel,"The B580 is actually very good for a $250 card as it performs similarly to the 4060 and more importantly has 12GB memory instead of 8GB. Even today it's still better value compared to the 5050 at the same price.  The main issue with the card is availability in certain regions, which impacts it's price. Where I'm from (Bangladesh) availability is actually pretty decent and so most B580s can be had for at or near the $250 msrp. The other issue with the card is it's driver overhead, which mostly shows up on the AM4 platform where the performance delta can sometimes be so massive that the card ends up slower than the 3060 12GB.  The issue is far less rampant on AM5. It performs around the 4060/5050 on a cheap R5 7500F, and is already beating the Nvidia cards in terms of value. It can still go faster if you pair it with the fastest CPU on the planet, but not by much and I personally don't think it's that big of a deal.   Alternatively you can play at 1440p and eliminate the driver overhead; the card has the performance and memory for it anyway, so why not. You can even go all the way upto 4k Balanced with XeSS 2.1 which is actually pretty good and supports frame gen. Kinda insane for a $250 card if you ask me.  Driver support and game compatibility is nowhere near as bad as Arc Alchemist, and people have even played the Battlefield 6 Beta on day 1. Older games such as those on DX9 or DX10 may still struggle compared to a 4060/5050, but the card is so fast you should still get highly playable framerates. We're talking 150 fps instead of 300fps, big deal.",Positive
Intel,No one buys them because people truth internet myths even from years ago but the reality is that those are very good gpus and near to MSRP are a great value.,Positive

I was still using the 566.36 driver until the Battlefield 6 beta made me update and since then I've encountered the flickering display and sudden black screen issues a few times that have been going on with pretty much every driver version since the 50 series came out.,Negative
Intel,"Rebar isn't all it needs. It needs a good CPU. I bought one to replace a 7600, paired with an i5-10400. After extensive testing it didn't really offer any improvement, and even performed worse in CPU-heavy/multiplayer titles. I thought the overhead issue was overblown, it isn't.",Negative

Intel,Like which one ?,Neutral
Intel,B series launched literally under a year ago.,Neutral
Intel,Depends. For gaming? Not really. Better bargains. But for a home server the a310 is the champ of media encoding,Neutral
Intel,"In gaming, the B series will generally be better in pretty much every way. It just runs faster, cooler, and cheaper. Outside gaming it gets a bit weird, but actually favors A series. The 310s are *very* good at media encoding for the price. The A770 can also outperform the B series in some non gaming tasks (generally its inferior, but it can get 4gb more vram and has a wider bus, which can make it better, or sometimes close enough that it being older and thus cheaper can make up the difference.) For gaming, B series is strictly better",Positive
Intel,The b580 is close to the a750 in performance. Not worth buying that. The a770 is better but I wouldn’t recommend them now with the amd 9060xt out.,Negative
Intel,"The median net worth in the US is 200k and the US accounts for more of Nvidia’s revenue than the rest of the world. Speak for yourself, big bro.   Regardless, what even prompted you to say this? I’m just answering OP’s question about Intel’s popularity lmao",Negative
Intel,Totally fine.,Positive
Intel,"Given you dont need to run DDU or (in some cases) do a fresh install of Windows to get the cards to run decently id argue theyre pretty well refined.   Even compared to AMDs drivers Nvidias just tend to work without much effort, from what ive been seeing it sounds like bf6 has had a ton of issues regardless of which gpu youve got. Having a set of rough updates off the back of 20+ years of development doesnt discount the amount of time theyve had to work on getting things working well. Intels 1st dgpus came out in 2022 IIRC",Neutral
Intel,Sure it can. You can get a 3070 at the cost or a 3070 Ti for a little more and it beats the B580.  I just sold my 3070 Ti for $290 a month ago because that's all people were willing to buy at. Some sold the card for even less.,Neutral
Intel,"A used b580 is better price to performance, they’re just kinda speaking arbitrarily",Neutral
Intel,3070 or 3070 Ti. One may cost more. I sold my 3070 Ti for $290 and others are selling for less.,Neutral
Intel,"Wrong, the B580 outperforms the A770 in every case i know.",Negative
Intel,You’re comparing the used market to the new market. You can get a used B580 for $170 on ebay as the first listing I see.,Neutral
Intel,"Not arbitrary with my assumption they want to spend $250 on a new B580. I don't know for sure they wanted to go new, but in case it was their plan, I'm saying instead of spending $250 on a new one if that's what their plan is, just spend $250 on a used card which will have better performance. It's really common sensical as to what I am saying. Don't understand what is arbitrary about that.",Neutral
Intel,"Wrong. The A770 has more VRAM and works better for AI/ML workloads.  That's why they're releasing other cards to help with loading models.    As for gaming performance, the A770 and B580 are very close in most benchmarks.  It's game dependent which one does better, but in scenarios more vram is needed the A770 wins.  12GB isn't terrible for 1080p/1440p workloads but it's just OK.",Neutral
Intel,"Indeed, that was my intent and my assumption that OP was going to go for new. $250 spent on a used card is spent better than on a new B580.  I don't think this point is invalid to the point where it should be downvoted.",Neutral
Intel,"Ok… but if OP is willing to buy used cards, $170 is better spent on a used B580 than $250 on a 3070 as you can spend the extra $80 to get other components that are better as well",Neutral
Intel,"Sure this is true, but I was only talking about going for a brand new B580 versus a used GPU. I naturally assume at such a low price point that people will go brand new on that GPU rather than used.  You can argue different scenarios with a different good answer, but what you stated wasn't exactly relevant to my assumption.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, but your assumption is inherently flawed is all I’m pointing out.",Neutral
Intel,"No, my assumption isn't flawed when I had no evidence to suggest that OP was going used on that card. How can I possibly know what OP intends on doing without it having been explicitly stated? I would personally expect them to go for a new card and not used as the card is already cheap enough to get it new (without considering budget constraints, but they also never stated any details on a budget and other essential info).   Hindsight and what comes after the comment was made is different, but my comment was based entirely on a very specific scenario. I think it's clear from my comment that I was specifically discussing differences between a new B580 and a different used card. I wasn't talking about anything else.",Neutral
Intel,"Your comment here already dismantles the scenario you thought of. You claimed you assumed they would be going for a new card. This assumption automatically means that going for a used card is out of the question, so comparing the new card to the used card doesn’t make sense. If OP were to be considering going used on cards, why would they not consider going used on the B580? The problem is that you didn’t think to expand the logic you presented beyond one specific card, which is inherently flawed.",Negative
Intel,For what purpose? Because if gaming is your goal this is not the play unless you’re refusing both AMD and Nvidia graphics for ideological reasons.,Negative
Intel,"So my goal is to get you to a RTX 5070 which requires $280 of reallocation.  - Downgrade the CPU to a 9600X. $160 saved  - You have three M.2 slots on your motherboard, you don’t need 4TB to start. Drop to 2TB $130 saved.  - Replace the Arc with an RTX 5070  Alternatively you can make a less severe CPU cut with the 7700X ($60 saved) and get the other $100 from your peripheral budget because frankly you don’t need $500 for all that. You could also downgrade the case to something with less fancy rgb (Montech XR, Phanteks XT View) but I understand some folks are very passionate with their case selection.",Neutral

Intel,"My idea was to buy a singular one now and another one later when I have the money for it. But dual variants look cool too if you can afford it. $2000 USD sounds too much though. I feel like the supplier in your area is jacking up the prices since it is difficult to find them.  I asked a friend of mine who does business hardware deals. He couldn't even get a quote. I guess it is not even available on many regions now.  Anyway, thanks for the info :)",Positive

Waiting on 5070Ti super - 24GB card with almost 1TBps VRAM bandwidth.",Positive
Intel,24GB VRAM for 500$ sounds super nice and not offered by any other GPU manufacturer. Plus they advertised a card with dual B60s (48GB VRAM total) sharing one PCI-E x16 slot (x8 each).,Positive
Intel,"I went down a similar route and ended up with a 5090. Less RAM than the Maxsun card, but the performance is insane.",Positive
Intel,"Then price the GPUs that have Tensor cores. I'm just wondering because Intel GPUs aren't traditionally for gaming, though that is slowly changing",Neutral
Intel,"Tensor cores is not the only thing that matters when it comes to performance. B60 performance was looking pretty good in the demos but now there is nothing on the internet, no benchmarks, no prices, no people with crazy connections showing off a hardware others cannot buy, nothing.",Negative
Intel,You have a very narrow vision of speed. What you are saying is like your truck is faster than my audi because it has more horsepower. Nvidia is the top dog right now but that doesn't mean you get more from nvidia for 200$. VRAM size and speed is something you cannot ignore. If you have to load half of the model to system memory it is gonna decrease your speed significantly. And guess what? If you can't fit the model into your memory you won't be running it even if you have a billion cuda cores. This is why intel is offering 24GB VRAM for 500$ while you need to pay 2500$ for the same VRAM size in nvidia (rtx a5000 for example).,Negative
Intel,"B60 is similar performance like 5060 in language of HW numbers. In language of TOPS it's slow, because CUDA... and FP4 optimisation of 5xxx cards... No, you really don't want to screw around for days to make OpenML or how is theirs ""engine"" called working...",Negative

Intel,"that should be good depending on the game. cpu intensive games can be tough, but if youre planning on 1440p and/or 4k the gpu gets taxed alot more anyway. the 9070 is a great card, ive owned one for about 4 months now and im very impressed with it. theres some OC headroom too.",Positive
Intel,When they inevitably do a refresh they better call it necromancer,Neutral
Intel,"Assuming the thing competes with a 5070 it's going to be bigger than a 5080 (the 4060 and B580 trade blows  the Arc is 70% bigger).  There's no way they can get any decent profit selling a 400+ mm2 die for 500$ (probably even less once the 5070 super launches). It will probably end up like the B580, a paper launch with most of the cards actually selling for 650$.  They're better just selling those dies to professionals with 32GB of VRAM.",Negative

Intel,All I know is we gonna lose,Negative
Intel,I have been saying for quite some time Intel will abandon Arc. They abandoned the GPU market in the past.  It is past embarrassing at this point what Apple offers with the integrated GPU in the M series of cpus and what Intel delivers.,Neutral
Intel,Let Intel Suffer for all the BS they did with their CPU division while they were a Monopoly and even after they declined still continued their BS  But i like Intel GPU division,Negative
Intel,Even before this announcement Intel Arc faced an uncertain future. Even their most successful GPU the B580 at the very least had razor thin margins if not outright being a loss leader.  Intel simply ran out of both time and money and they can't keep bleeding money on their GPU division with the company's current situation. If Intel actually managed to execute and follow their initial roadmap and release Alchemist GPUs during the COVID pandemic we'd probably be looking at a very different Intel GPU division but here we are now.,Negative
Intel,I don’t necessarily think that it’s that dramatic. The Arc GPUs are aimed at a market that Nvidia no longer competes in (the budget GPU space). If anything you’d think Nvidia would be more supportive of the Arc stuff getting off the ground because it means they can dedicate more fab space to producing the higher end stuff that’s in demand for AI and industry use and commands better margins.,Neutral
Intel,I wonder if this is specifically to go after the handheld pc gaming space where amd basically has a monopoly.,Neutral

Intel,I truly hope Intel won't drop their GPU division.,Negative
Intel,"Such a weird thing going on in this thread. Did people forget when AMD acquired ATI it was to make a complete package APUs and for both respective companies to compete with Intel and Nvidia.   Now Nvidia probably wants to do same thing in the CPU market and intel gets the benefits of being with Nvidia in the GPU market.  Only reason it did not happen sooner was because Intel was still king marketwise then.  Intel could have easily acquired Nvidia in 2006 when AMD acquired ATI, or even in 2011 when AMD stopped using ATI branding.",Neutral

Intel,"I think it would be pretty sweet, if they could cook up something like the apples M series.",Positive
Intel,Uh...why?  Nvidia have consistently had the most power efficient GPUs on the market for years now. That technology in an APU? That's promising stuff.  It wouldn't surprise me if we start to see 4050/4060 performance on a single chip. Imagine what that means for handhelds.,Positive

Intel,"How would they suffer? Intel isn't a living entity, and the executives that led the downfall of Intel left, who is gonna suffer except intel's employees and us?",Negative
Intel,"> But i like Intel GPU division    The problem with the Intel GPUs is they are clearly struggling with the technology. The B580 needs a much bigger die than equivalent Nvidia cards, meaning it must be expensive for Intel to make the chips and uncomfortable to sell them at such a low price.   That might be ok initially to get a foot in the door for their GPU brand, but if they can't get the efficiency up then from a business point of view they just can't continue it.",Negative
Intel,Nvidia still sells gt710 and and rtx3050 for the low end,Neutral
Intel,"Make no mistake, this will be marketed for AI before gaming",Neutral
Intel,"Yes but AMD didn't have a GPU division when they bought ATI last I checked, what became of ATI is AMD's Radeon division, CPU or GPU both remained with two major players. The problem here have here is that Intel IS a player in the GPU space, they are the opportunity to have a 3rd company for extra competition but Arc is still in a vulnerable stage where it could easily get axed if it isn't bringing in more money than what they spend. Nvidia investing and putting in RTX iGPUs is the sort of thing that could devalue Arc iGPU investment.",Neutral
Intel,Maybe they want competition. Unlike NVIDIA now wants to have 100% share to everything. Monoply at its finest,Neutral

Intel,"That's roughly the power on the amd ai 395+ max whatever the fuck that chip is called. It's mostly ai oriented, not gaming, but the apu has 4060 or above performance in most games.  The real question is whether nvidia would make such an investment for handheld devices which they dont seem to care for all that much, or mabw they just want their foot in the ai tablet market where amd has taken the lead.",Neutral

Intel,"True like now that they are at the Top where are Ryzen 3? Where are CPUs for the Budget Gamers? Im have money so i dont need ryzen 3.

Intel,"Yup, I'm someone with an all AMD build, and Intel going down the shitter and the possibility of Arc being axed is not something I'm happy about at all.   Even if I was one of those weirdos with diehard brand loyalty and didn't care about a monopoly/duopoly being solidified, it's still going to suck for me as an RDNA3 user because Intel is still the only only making an (officially supported) upscaler for my card that isn't completely dogshit.

Intel,"They were actually eating some of AMD's shares, Nvidia didn't budge",Neutral
Intel,"You’re not wrong, but that’s not entirely the point. It was a sign that a big company like Intel was willing to dump significant resources into R&D in a new and heavily dominated market segment. The A series was a good if not sloppy start (general driver & performance issues, many were fixed over time), and the B580 was an amazing bang for your buck card. They were improving fast in the technology, and while they are still on larger dies than NVDA & AMD they were offering cost-performance in the budget/mid range sector that the others weren’t.

Intel,">  and Apple doesn't want to directly open their OS to Vulkan or Directx. Everything needs to go through metal in some way.  Without buying out MS apple cant support DX. (and even if they did the flavor of DX used by PC titles is not compatible with apples GPUs).  And while apple could support VK, remember VK is not HW agnostic, a PC VK backend (the small number to titles that have these) will be written expliclty to target AMD/NV GPUs and would require rather large changes to run well (or even at all) on a VK driver for apples GPUs on macOS.    The work needed to add a metal backend to a modern engine (if it does not already have one... most do) is not that large.  All modern engines are written to be mutli backend enabled.  The amount of a games engine that directly calls a graphics apis is intently tiny since we need this to run very fast within the Redner loop, idealizing keeping the entire loop within L1 Cpu cache.     Adding metal support to an engine is not were the work is.  All the other changes, user input, file system, Audio, networking, digital signatures, color spaces (Mac users expect proper HDR)... this is all way more work than adding metal.    (also most engines already have metal backends).     from a graphics side of things there is a LOT of work but this work is API agnostic and relates to making changes to target the HW (you would need to do this regardless of API as all the modern apis want to remove runtime overhead of the driver reputedly making these optimizations over and over again on each frame).",Negative

AMD will definitely take the foot off the gas with Intel continuing to crumble, keep sales up and fatten margins.

Intel,"To deliver that price/performance they had to sell at cost, the B580's die is 20% bigger than a 5070 and Intel is selling them for less than half the price. Heck, the thing competes with a 4060 and it's 2x the size.  As long as they can't get even remotely competitive on die size they'll be stuck in this situation and personally I'd rather have them spending money on figuring their shit out on the CPU side to avoid  a monopoly instead of selling at cost low end GPUs than don't work well on low end CPUs.",Negative

There’s never been a time in the last 20 years I’ve been watching the gpu market Nvidia has not filled the lowest tier with older generations of cards. If there’s a shortage of manufacturing capacity at the bleeding edge, they can just use older manufacturing processes so there’s no reason not to fill lower tiers if people are buying them. This is what AMD does for their lowest tier CPUs, they use older manufacturing processes, like 7nm and 14nm",Neutral
Intel,"Die size is important, it's the main driver of the cost. Also the point is not the size itself, it's the fact that it performs like a 150mm die from the competition so it has to be priced accordingly.

Intel,"For what it's worth my 4070 system can generally hit 4k 60fps (w vsync) with dlss performance and settings on medium with some on high. No FG.   The 4080 I can get 4k 100-110fps with dlss balanced and mostly high settings w FG.   The 4090 rig I hit 140fps at 3440x1440 with dlss quality w everything maxed except volumetric fog/cloud, direction shadow quality and foilage density are on high, the 4090 is also undervolted.  Game is pretty playable overall, performance is okay not great but no where near as bad as reddit would make you think.",Neutral
Intel,"Crazy that the Twitter account had the B580 as recommended.  Other than that, what's considered playable nowadays? Usually I expect 60fps for single player or PvE games. Which doesn't seem hard to get based on these metrics.  Doesn't anyone remember that new games always tax the best hardware? Like, I remember when Crysis came out and it was nearly impossible to play at max settings without the best of the best.  Randy is an idiot and ass, and the game needs to be optimized better, but this doesn't seem like the huge deal people are making it out to be.",Negative

Intel,"I really like BL4, and I wish it ran faster. I have to use framegen with balanced FSR",Positive
Intel,Maybe newer drivers or specific optimization? I think it does have somekind of lumen rt?,Neutral
Intel,Could be FSR4 vs FSR3,Neutral
Intel,my guess is it loads in the entire region all at once and all the background effects & shit probably chugs the UE5 engine. other UE5 games ive had doesnt have as much of a hit than this game,Negative

Intel,All of my Nvidia friends keep saying when they load somewhere it's like 50/50 they have to compile shaders for some reason. I've only had to do it once at the start on my 9070xt.,Neutral
Intel,"No discernible difference is definitely not true. In any environment consisting of a low light area with light sources such as wall lights, floor lamps, neon signs, etc, there is very noticeable grainy and bouncy lighting effects emitted from these sources that look horrible when the setting is not maxed. The game was built around it being maxed unfortunately. I still would drop it to medium but you do lose a large amount of visual fidelity.",Negative

Intel,"I have a theory that might be because the drivers for AMD are less processor heavy than Nvidia's. So a game like this, which is very heavy on the processor, punishes AMD less on that front.",Neutral
Intel,No. The 3090 is usually around 4070 super/5070 type performance. 9070 is usually around a 4070ti super/7900xt type performance. The 9070xt is usually around a 5070ti/7900xtx/4080 and sometimes 5080 type performance.,Neutral

Intel,"Didn't notice grainy/bouncy(?)/flickery lighting effects, which I've been seeing in a lot of Lumen stuff. I'll try to compare High vs Medium tonight but as far as I can see in Hub's video, medium is only darker because there's less GI bounces.",Neutral
Intel,"It’s likely downstream of differences in shader compute - UE5 moves many (but not all) visual features over to running entirely on compute, rather than raster/RT pathways, and a huge portion of frametime is now spent here on stuff like nanite, VSMs and software lumen. This is quite different from how most other engines have historically behaved frame-to-frame. It creates an opportunity for divergent performance characteristics from what we might ordinarily expect between IHVs; RDNA is often ahead in graphics-concurrent async compute, which could be contributing here to overall performance and frame health, but there are a lot of architectural differences potentially at play.  We see this behavior still at very high resolutions and lower framerates, which indicates it’s not generally a driver overhead thing (as a primary cause - it definitely contributes though, increasingly so with higher framerates)",Neutral

Intel,"The faster PCIe 4.0/5.0 and future iterations mean that dedicated SLI/Crossfire bridges are obsolete. The PCIe bandwidth nowadays is more than enough. And PCIe is the generic industry standard interface, easier to program for than proprietary hardware that's different for every vendor.   For games multi-GPU is gone for good (too few users, too large cost of development, no return of investment for game Studios). But in simulation/HPC/AI software multi-GPU is very common as it allows to go beyond the VRAM capacity of a single large GPU for cheaper.",Neutral
Intel,"sli/crossfire were killed for good reason, its just a bad time all around if half of your gpu's core/cache is located a foot away from the other half, unless your baseline performance is so damn low that the microstutters just get lost in the noise.  ultimately chiplet cpu/gpu designs are basically just an evolved form of sli/crossfire, and we're happily starting to get quite good at those.

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers.

And these consoles are pretty power constrained and pared down compared to PCs. So this APU here could easily double the performance of a console.   That's tapping on 4070/7800 levels of performance.",Positive
Intel,Never gonna happen as long as they use DDR memory.  The only powerful APUs are those that use GDDR or HBM. See: every AMD-powered console and the MI300A.,Negative
Intel,"Radeon iGPUs are mostly limited by the shared RAM bandwidth. I was thinking of getting an 8700G a little while ago, and the benchmarks varied wildly depending on RAM frequency and overclocks.  Maybe they'll improve it by hooking it up to a wider GDDR bus in laptops, similar to how the current PS5 and Xboxes work (IIRC?)",Neutral
Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks. Intel is already moving on it and I think the main thing holding AMD back is that they rely on 3rd parties for memory packaging so the capacity goes to the more lucrative enterprise chips first.",Neutral
Intel,"The iGPU uplift is extremely underwhelming, I guess this is why Asus did the ROG Ally X model instead of waiting for these chips. I wouldnt be surprised if Lunar Lake with Xe2 passes Zen 5's iGPU at lower power levels, at higher ones im sure RNDA 3.5 will be ahead.",Negative

Intel,"It'll need to be a custom tooled APU like Aerith/Van Gogh if it is to take full advantage of the 890m.     Nearly all of the configs that release of 16cu Point APU or 40cu Halo will be an APU slapped in a chassis without an adequate power or memory bandwidth setup for the igpu.     What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra. Its desktop tower chip is behind the entry level mobile OS chip from its competitor. It is a decade behind the desktop chips of its competitor, itis hardly Monster class.",Neutral

And AMD ""can make"" such APUs -> PS5 Pro (as a more cost effective solution). AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative
Intel,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",Negative

If Intel can be competitive in the budget market it will at least put a fire under amd to lower their prices/make a better valued product.",Negative
Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't.

Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral
Intel,"This was a graphics card, not a ‘GPU’ in terms that we understand them now, just to bolster the point about how much of a disparity this comparison reveals.",Neutral
Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so?

I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Intel,"And I'm over here struggling to keep an Nvidia T4 passthrough to work reliably on Hyper-V to Ubuntu 22.04. :(  Is there a specific software combination that works more reliably than others?   Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.

Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.

We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line.

Intel,"I’ve been buying ATI / AMD since the ATI Rage 128, and I think my next GPU will be Nvidia. I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

Also some other games having driver timeouts to, but i have games that also never timeout.

I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.  Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical. I guess that's why nobody is already doing it.",Neutral

I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?

Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with?    My own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures.",Neutral

Intel,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

Intel,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

When you run several machines off of a single unit, suddenly there's workloads that has to be completely in due time for things to move ahead.  I just want to contextualize the issue you are making (a tadd) fun of.  So in the basic but common example above, you can't really complete your job because the entire main system has to be shut down. That's like stranding 6 people because the bus broke down. And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.  I think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable. There need to be a proper high-grade (and low grade) reliable way to avoid that.  Just sucks it took this long, and so much effort to get AMD to pay notice to the issue at hand here.

In Linux - *in some cases, but it very common* - you get more VRAM usage on Nvidia compare to AMD because this how Vulkan driver implemented in Nvidia and overhead of DXVK.  P.S. For context - Unity VRAM usage is - Unity allocating ""how much it want"" and in case of two different GPU Unity may allocate less or more in DX-API, or DX-API have some internal behavior for Unity case on Nvidia so it allocating less.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

Intel,"Firstly, i am barely even able to find any posts about this issue. Which means that issue is extremely case specific, so you should not categorically blame AMD and Adrenaline. With how many people this happen with, it is not problem of Adrenalin itself (otherwise it would've been reported A LOT more than i can find).   They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.     From global issues with CPU OC was only one i mentioned. When AMD integrated Ryzen Master, old GPU OC presets did reset CPU OC values to default.

Intel,"Use Radeon Image Sharpening at 50% in the game's Radeon Settings profile when running native. FSR2 has its own sharpening pass. Many TAA implementations are blurry as fuck, which gives the illusion of better image quality when upscaling.",Negative
Intel,Okay fair enough! To me any upscaling has always looked worse than native in the games I've played and I've left it off.  Though it has undoubtedly gotten better recently - to my eyes it's never looked **better** than native resolution.,Negative
Intel,"I've used both FSR (2160p desktop) and DLSS (1080p laptop) and the loss in quality is noticeable to me. Always a softer image with less detail - yes, even DLSS. Performance always has a cost. Temporal upscaling is no different. DLAA and FSRAA actually are better than native, since they replace terrible TAA implementations and render at native.  However, this better than native upscaling narrative seems more like a belief (or a marketing push/tactic) than reality.   - If action is high enough, it probably won't matter much, but in single-player games where I like to look around, I just can't deal with the resolution loss. I'd rather turn RT off, as I did in Control (for AMD and Nvidia HW), which actually has decent RT effects.",Negative

Intel,> Enthusiast   > 1440p [...] with FSR Quality [...] 60 FPS  1440p + xxxx Quality upscaling is just another way to say 1080p you cowards. It's 2023 and enthusiast level is 1080p @ 60 FPS.

So sick of the awful PC ports and such. 6800xt is still a very powerful card yet I'm seeing more and more games require it for 1440p 60fps high or even 1080p 60 fps high. Ridiculous.  The reliance on upscaling tech instead of properly optimizing the game is becoming a problem. And it seems this game has forced RT which is idiotic. RT destroys performance and should always be an option.",Negative

Intel,so I'm doomed to use FSR even at 1080p ? what a shame pc gaming has become.,Negative
Intel,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?  (I'm not talking about this game in particular, just in general, it was same outrage w/ AW2 and that turned out better than expected)",Neutral

Intel,"Another garbage with forced upscaling at baseline. When upscaling winded up - everyone was ""Hell yeah, high refresh rate AAA gaming""  Fast forward to today: ""FSR performance just to hit 1080p 60fps - yay..""   I fucking knew it.. it was so obvious upscaling will turn into this and replace game optimizations. Why optimizing shit, when you can tell people to turn on fucking FSR / DLSS / XeSS performance??   What a fucking shitshow... And few weeks back when I said I'm not gonna buy AMD GPU again because upscaling is getting mandatory and DLSS is just objectively superior - I was laughed in the face. Every major AAA game onwards will be shoving up upscaling as base line performance - so your typical 60fps marks (and 30fps - yes apparently that is still a thing on PC in 2023).

Also, displaying system requirements with upscaling is a bad joke. This is basically saying you’re not getting native 1080p 60fps without a 6800xt or 3080.

Intel,"I think we're at a point in gaming where DLSS / FSR will be mainstream in pretty much every game now. I mean even my 4080 can't get 60FPS 1440p in the Witcher 3 or Cyberpunk maxed out with ray tracing, have to use DLSS to increase to above 60fps. I do think DLSS / FSR is actually good technology, but for those enthusiasts who like to play native, I feel like having a $1200 GPU that can't run 4K or even 1440p ULTRA settings at 60fps depending on the game, is just a cash grab.",Neutral
Intel,Is vrr fixed with frame gen then?,Neutral
Intel,"Will someone please get a message to developers that FSR/DLSS should be *optional* and used only if you want to sacrifice some visual fidelity in order to run 144 FPS+ on high refresh rate displays, and let them know FSR/DLSS should never be *required* to get a 90GB bundle of spaghetti code to *barely* reach a blurry ass 60 FPS?  K? Theeenks!",Negative
Intel,"Yet another AMD sponsored game without DLSS....      EDIT: Nm, it appears this game will offer DLSS thank god.",Positive
Intel,Hoping with my 7800x3d and 7900xtx fsr 3 4k maxed is around 120fps for my tv refresh rate. To be honest at my age I barely notice the quality difference of any input lag.,Neutral
Intel,They recommend upscaling even at 1080p.. disgusting ew,Negative
Intel,pretty much this we all knew they would start using upscaling as a crutch.,Negative
Intel,Welcome to modern times and how you can’t just brute force everything anymore. Or you can go buy a 4090 and not complain about how expensive that is.,Negative
Intel,"Yeah, I'm not crazy about using upscaling techniques on everything to gauge it's performance and requirements. I think more time needs spent on optimization but I could be ignorant for stating that.",Negative
Intel,My thoughts too…,Neutral
Intel,Thanks to all of you that were screaming dlss looks better than native lmao.,Positive
Intel,"I tend to be much more picky than those around me. A group of people I play with were all playing Remnant 2, and I FSR was driving me crazy, they all have way less powerful computers than I do, and none of them cared at all FSR was on. In fact they were impressed with how well it ran and how it looked. I think there is a general 80% of the PC population that doesn't mess with graphic settings and just wants the game to play. I'm a min/maxer when it comes to graphics where I constantly tweak it until I get the perfect output for me.     I'd love to have real data from games like this on how many people actively change graphic settings.",Neutral
Intel,and a year ago i kept saying this here and i got downvoted to hell   its so obvious that the game engine devs and game companies pressured both nvidia and amd for this because they can release games faster and somewhat unoptimised,Negative
Intel,"Upscaling, once a promising and beneficial tech, now abused by almost every dev cause they are lazy to optimize. :(",Negative
Intel,Nope we as a community abused a nice thing,Positive
Intel,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",Neutral
Intel,Didn't take them long to make upscaling worthless.,Negative
Intel,i smell a burgeoning cottage industry of game spec reviewers!,Neutral
Intel,"I've hated upscaling since the beginning.   Now, it's being proven right in our faces that companies are no longer making 100% they're making 45% done games, and then they rely on upscaling and fake frames to do the rest.   Why have a fully optimized game that runs well natively when you can just lower the resolution by 3x then have frame generation help?   Full force ahead to frame generation= Every game will be optimized so badly that you're forced to upscale",Negative
Intel,"It’s literally right there in the hardware specs. 1080p fsr2 quality is 720p input resolution, so at native the game runs at 720p low on a 1070 or 5700.  It is the inverse of what reviewers have been doing with their benchmarks - if you are a fan who really has a stick up their ass about native res, just do the math yourself. They’ve given you all the pieces you need to calculate it out yourself, but that’s not how the game is supposed to be run so they aren’t going to put native res in the official marketing material.  Games are optimized around upscaling now and it is unhelpful and misleading to pretend otherwise. Rendering 4x as many pixels is *obviously* going to throw things off with more intensive effects, and lead to a generally unplayable experience.",Neutral
Intel,"Judging by how games work on 4090/7900 xtx, these cards turn from 4k 60 fps to 1080p 60 fps",Neutral
Intel,requirements have been a joke for over 20 years at this point i dont know why people are surprised.   on the other hand crappy devs using fancy upscaling and fake frames to get the game playable instead of just making a well made game is infuriating,Negative
Intel,yeah this is the new standard,Neutral
Intel,"RT is the future. With this game and Alan Wake 2 using software RT at all times and hardware RT for anything beyond ""low"", RT is the future.  At some point GPUs will be so powerful and game engines will have RT in the bag that RT will be used in basically all indie games...and then suddenly nobody will talk about RT anymore because RT is in everything for years.",Positive
Intel,and with fsr now standard on consoles it(or a similar tech) will be standard on pc :(,Neutral
Intel,"people also forget both AMD and nvidia didn't really offer a generation leap in GPU performance this gen, sure it's popular to call games ""unoptimized"" (I know many AAA releases are, not denying that) but the issue compounds with the fact that game devs couldn't predict a GPU generation to be this bad caused by inflated crypro-boom margins a generation prior",Negative
Intel,"As with almost every game release recently, expect the game to perform a bit better than the requirements.    Sometimes the hardware can achieve 60 FPS most of the time but drops below that in other times, so the devs just say it's guaranteed 30 FPS and call it a day. If you look at the 5700 vs 6700XT, the gap is almost 50% in most titles, this means that if the numbers for the 5700 were accurate then the 6700XT will be getting around 45 FPS at 1080p low (unless the game utilizes special hardware only available on the 6700XT) but the game targets 60 FPS at 1080p high on the 6700XT which leads me to believe the 5700 is gonna perform much better which should leave room for turning off upscaling.",Positive
Intel,"It does state ray tracing in the top right, we don't know if that's included in the requirements or not. I would definitely reserve judgment until we find out.",Neutral
Intel,Don't forget about Frame Gen too. IMO that's the worst part because that means it's 30 fps without it. Imagine the input latency...,Negative
Intel,The actual true crime here is even having fsr to begin with. It should just have dlss,Negative
Intel,Seems like they tried to cover every basis with these.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah it's kinda weird, even games that had a massive difference of performance when using dual channel RAM never listed it on their requirements :/",Negative
Intel,"I've noticed that many developers do this, for some reason developers seem to have some kind of secret passion for the 1070 lol",Neutral
Intel,It's because the minimum settings is with software RT enabled and thus they're using the fastest cards without hardware RT that can reach 1080p30 FSR2.,Neutral
Intel,"GCN support is over, RDNA1 is the lowest currently supported arch.",Neutral
Intel,"In 2023, RX 5700 performs equally or better than the RTX 2060 Super/2070. The 5600XT is more like a 2060 competitor.   Either the game runs like shit on AMD hardware, or the system requirements are wrong and they just write down the components that they tested with.   Another thing is that the game is doing is software based RT by default and that might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.",Negative
Intel,"They're not, those are the cheapest/slowest GPUs that have 8 GB of VRAM. Clearly game devs are done pandering to people who bought Nvidia's e-waste.",Negative
Intel,What do you mean forced raytracing?,Neutral
Intel,1440 + upscaling looks better than 1080p because you're on a 1440 resolution monitor.   Do you even 1440p?,Positive
Intel,"Honestly RT has a lot of fluff and the majority of which is the most costly for the least amount of noticeable fidelity increase. Try path tracing in Cyberpunk with reduced rays & bounces and you'll still get great soft lighting and GI without most of the performance hit when full tilt. If games only leverage certain aspects of RT then the performance is still comparable, that's also why the 3080 and 6800XT perform similarly in Fortnite with full RT/nanite/lumen settings.",Neutral
Intel,It's actually 960p :(,Neutral
Intel,"can advertize pushing all the triangles and RT if you dont stick with a low resolution, certain things launched WAY before they should have in the consumer space.",Neutral

Intel,Seems pretty good to me given it is at 4K with RT,Positive
Intel,"Likely includes the RT features , its also 4k",Neutral
Intel,"Its ubishit, what do u expect, however, since the game has RT reflections, shadows and GI, then i would say this is based on AMD shit RT performance, so lets wait and see how the 4080 is gonna perform.",Negative

Intel,">Really disliking this trend of all new games having ""with FSR/DLSS"" in their PC requirements tables. T  its not much different for consoles , like alan wake 2 uses Low to mid settings and FSR balanced on PS5 even on switch titles use scaling and no man sky even FSR and stuff.",Negative
Intel,"I agree with this, that’s not that outrageous if this does include RT. Non RT would be pretty bad to need fsr but that is the quality mode.",Neutral
Intel,This is going to be the exact same situation as with Alan Wake. The game is going to come out and the requirements are going to make sense. People just aren't used to seeing games with mandatory rt.,Neutral
Intel,I would say pressured bc they announced it over a year ago and promised we will get it in september. Thats the problem with games an tech they all make promises and then cant keep the deadline. Just make smth new and when it works then announce it and make the last fine adjustments. If you make promises to early you set yourself up for failure.,Negative
Intel,"Maybe on the lower end, but for enthusiast and ultra... no, they're not ""significantly"" better. These are pretty on-par comparisons (outside of RT).",Negative
Intel,"How so? The 4080 and 7900xtx are neck in neck, same as the 6800 and 3080.",Neutral
Intel,"It's 4k, it will take another 5-8 years to be mainstream.  1440p slowly creeping to 10% marketshare give it another 2-3 years to be mainstream",Neutral
Intel,"Consoles use fsr as well, and not just fsr but often at low precision making the upscale rougher. Its an industry wide trend.",Neutral
Intel,">what a shame pc gaming has become.

Intel,"> what a shame pc gaming has become  I mean, PC gaming is in the best state ever. So many amazing games that run so well. Just don't buy all these shitty games, not like there is a shortage.  Tbh this game looks like standard movie cash grab shite anyway. Solid 4/10 game I bet.",Negative
Intel,Which means if all games will require upscaling it will force AMD to improve there's. I'm on board with you though will see way less optimization going forward which is not what we want.,Negative

Intel,"Mirage is PS4 game, Avatar is PS5",Neutral
Intel,"Update: I must've read that wrongly somewhere! Apparently, it uses their own Snowdrop Engine 😳  Well AC: Mirage is nowhere near a next-gen game. Avatars of Pandora, on the other hand, uses Unreal Engine 5 with hardware ray tracing. So it's only natural it needs more horse power. But it'll look 10x better than AC: Mirage. So there's that 😉",Negative
Intel,Timed epic exclusivity? Aww man.,Neutral
Intel,Was guaranteed to happen when up scaling was announced... It's an excuse for less optimisation or to push fidelity more.  I saw a video of this avatar game it got an insane amount of plants visible at all times.,Negative
Intel,You... are.. joking... right..?,Neutral
Intel,Because it’s not coming to steam. It’ll be an epic games exclusive so everyone will pass on it until it hits steam in 18 months. At which point no one will buy an 18 month old game for full price and will wait for a 50% off sale at the minimum.,Negative

Intel,Yea I know nothing about optimizations and if it could or couldn't fix this or that. I just want them to tell me exactly what I need to run the game at X resolution a Y preset with 60 fps. If that calls for a 14900k and a 4090 then just say so.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, I think we're really beginning to see a trend here with abusing upscaling for free mileage.  Not that upscaling isn't great but...  Apart from RT, on medium settings, I can't really see    massive improvements on visual quality that would warrant such a massive increase on requirements.  UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  We'll probably see this continuing to be a trend for a while, and then as tech novelty wears out, some devs will come out with more optimized and scalable titles.  With hardware prices being as they are, and with 60fps now being highly requested in consoles as well, it's pretty much a given.",Negative
Intel,"People accepted upscaling with open arms, so now devs know they can rely on people using it. Thus they don't have to care about optimizing for native res anymore. Oh you have a 4k card? Okay well we'll make sure it can run the game at 1080p so you can upscale it.",Neutral

Intel,They have really long way to go. Take for example Lords of the Fallen - UE5's TSR is better than FSR. Take Alan Wake 2 and you get ton of shimmering on the edges. It's also not like nvidia not improving - so while AMD makes a step forward so will do nvidia..   There's also question how much they improve without dedicated accelerators that both Intel and nvidia is using. Intel jumped late to the party and they're already ahead - which just shows how much AMD cares. It's rally embarrassing considering both XBOX and PlayStation are also relying on FSR - ant that's bigger market than what nvidia has.,Neutral
Intel,I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?  I mean the facts are the facts. I need to play on lower settings till we get a 5070 or 8800xt.,Neutral
Intel,"It uses their own in-house engine, Snowdrop. The last game this developer did was The Division II which was excellent.",Neutral
Intel,"Took a look at some gameplay on YouTube, and it does look nice enough, though water looked like ass, and as mentioned already, it's an in-house engine (which is nice to see TBH).",Positive
Intel,"Next gen seems promising so far, low native rez hidden by upscaling, 60 FPS target on +500$ GPUs, traversal stuttering thanks to the glorious UE5. But hey, we have great reflections on puddles so at least we can take good looking screenshots.",Positive
Intel,You will never see a high production game from Ubisoft ever on the Steam store ever again at initial launch.  They are the anti-christ of the gaming industry seriously.,Negative
Intel,Consoles are the baseline in most multiplat games and they've been using upscaling since forever. The real reason is just that we don't have GPUs anymore that are 10x faster than consoles like last gen. You can't bruteforce high resolutions in games that run at like 720p on consoles with GPUs that are only 2-3x faster.  If upscaling didn't exist on PC the minimum here would just be 720p at the minimum and 1080p-1440p at the max.,Negative
Intel,Next-gen doesn't mean that current gen can run it well. It means it's so far ahead that most curren-gen hardware can't run it properly + top-end hardware can only barely run it well.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly. These paid exclusive games launches only make me care less whenever they actually release.  It's not just Epic, Meta has done it with several games (Moss Book 2) and when a proper looking pcvr port comes a year later it sells bad because people forgot about it.",Negative
Intel,"Is that with significant RT? I assumed it was ""normal"" ultra settings.  Still I can play Far Cry 6 and RE4 with AMD sponsored RT at 4k native with 100fps. This game will have to look amazing to justify what... a quarter of that performance?",Neutral
Intel,"You are correct. I overlooked the part where, under Ultra settings, it said that was with FSR2. Now it doesn't seem as bad. I mean, it's still not good because it's rendering somewhere between 1080p and 1440p, but at least it's not 30 fps without Frame Gen/60 fps with it like I thought.",Neutral
Intel,"It might be, AFAIK neither Nvidia nor AMD still support their implementation of it in their drivers.  But I've tried it on a few games and it is pretty cool to me, much stronger than almost any modern 3D movie (IMO why 3D has gone into hibernation), and I gather that Cameron designed the franchise around 3D.  Plus the Avatar 1 game was in 3D.  FWIW.",Positive
Intel,This is what I am thinking too.,Neutral
Intel,"You say that, but they specifically mentioned FSR3, and just DLSS, so i have a feeling DLSS3 will have to go via a mod again.",Neutral
Intel,"i have a believe that even 4C8T will survive for the decade, like the case of that 4790K. But turns out these newer UE5 games are wrecking even newish CPU like the 3600. i mean cmon it's still a 4 years CPU old which i think it's not old yet",Neutral
Intel,Let's hope so. 30fps is far from recommended for FSR 3,Negative
Intel,Yeah I heard it works with that hoping it works with fsr3 now,Positive
Intel,"I've noticed that for some reason newer games look blurry at 1080 even without any kind of upscaling and I'm not sure why, older game look much sharper at 1080p",Negative
Intel,"Just lazy optimisation, that’s pretty much a PS5 equivalent GPU and you can be damn sure that the console version won’t be 1080P 30fps with FSR",Negative
Intel,"No it says 5700. NOT 5700XT, and yes there is a difference. Quite literally the difference between a 1070 and 1080ti. Or a 2070 and 2080.",Neutral
Intel,no no my 7 year old card needs to be able to play at high settings. so does my low end card from today. gotta be high or its just bad,Negative
Intel,Crazy expectation? A game released in 2023 should be able to run at 1080p low 30fps on a low end card like rx6500xt (lowest end modern card you can buy now).  Optimization matters.,Neutral
Intel,"Yup, these cards came out around the time of ps4 I think..that's a long time ago in the graphical quality of games we are seeing.  People should be happy to a point that those cards can even run some of these games if upscaling helps them run that's a bonus as it means they don't need to upgrade if those graphics settings are acceptable to them.",Positive
Intel,"I have a 5700 and it does better at 1080p on these games than what is normally posted. Now it does need quality fsr but its not the worst thing, anything lower than quality is. Bottom line is these are not 100% correct and never have been.  I have zero interest in this game but the specs seem fine even though I wish upscaling wasn't what was relied on for optimization.",Neutral
Intel,"well you dont know what they mean by 30 fps. It could be de 1% lows or the average, we dont know. The easy assumption is that it will be 30 fps average. but that's crazy that a game at 1080p low cant be run by a 5700. It better be a new Crysis.  edit: apparently it uses raytracing only for lighting which would explain the hows and why it crushes the framerate so bad especially on a gpu that doesnt have hardware raytracing like the 5700.",Negative
Intel,"Or in the case of games like Alan Wake 2, you will get unplayable fps if you try to running it at 4k native max settings. Even with a 4090, you will get a glorious 20fps.",Negative
Intel,Assassins creed origins and odyssey side quests/collectibles oh my god,Positive
Intel,Yeah it doesn't give us a actual gauge to understand what we need for set native parameters. I mentioned optimization out of concern that they rely too much on upscaling and it seems like it's the lazy way out of something. It's unrealistic that a usable gaming experience be in a top tier hardware setup that costs $2k+ and top tier hardware of just the last generation are just barely cutting it anymore.,Negative
Intel,I appreciate your insights and opinions. Thank you.,Positive
Intel,">UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  Because they market how ""good"" it looks, not how ""well"" it runs. There's a big influence from marketing perspective to place high focus on ""eye candy"", it's what sells.  The how ""well"" it runs is usually restricted to the small % of us gaming nerds. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flip_out)",Neutral
Intel,console games started upscaling way before PCs .,Negative
Intel,This sub is rife with crazy conspiracy theories. I don't think it was this insane a couple years back.,Negative
Intel,you forgot who owns one of the most popular engines out there?,Neutral
Intel,"I guess technically it would count but then everyone would flame it for looking bad. But seriouly, what happened when Ultra settings ran real smooth on top of the line hardware? Gone those times.",Negative
Intel,downvoted by devs lol,Neutral
Intel,> RTX 4080 is 50% Faster than RTX 3080.  The msrp is 71% higher too.,Positive
Intel,"Yeah at 1200 bucks and above you got one, that's true but many cards below didn't offer much.",Neutral
Intel,that's stoopid but it's somewhat more understandable. Why a 5700 would struggle so much since it doesnt have hardware raytracing,Negative
Intel,Yep it's like a 10/15% performance uplift in some games but I'd guess they would prefer to keep the requirements sheets somewhat simple.,Neutral
Intel,Why is there a dialog message about unsupported hardware when you try and run a 390X?,Negative
Intel,It can do software based RT just like every other modern GPU out there.,Neutral
Intel,Well then no wonder rx 5700 can't manage 30 fps lol,Neutral
Intel,"Wait so we are finally getting games made only with ray tracing in mind? This is actually great, 2023 is officially the year the new generation started",Positive
Intel,Avatars uses a Lumen like software RT solution.,Neutral
Intel,"yeah they never finished the sentence for some reason. The full sentences is ""its better than native, when native has forced taa!"" which is why dlaa/fsraa at native look so much better than the upscale versions. normal basic TAA is just so bad, that even upscales not using it look better than native using it",Negative
Intel,"The AA side of things might be better, but I swear no matter the resolution textures become a blurry mess even with Quality mode etc, and it irks me that most people don't seem to notice that.",Negative
Intel,Some people seem to have very low sensitivity to added blur. See also *depth of field blur* and *motion blur* being on by default in every game. It's funny how much people rage against FXAA/DoF/Motion blur but ignore DLSS.  Of course only one is tied to someone's purchasing decision :),Negative
Intel,"Yeah, thatsl happened.",Neutral
Intel,">every time I tell them that I can tell the difference between native and upscaled and it's not better then natibe they call me a liar and downvote  Well, yes, you are using shitty FSR which is literally unplayable no matter resolution instead of godly DLSS that is literally better than native even at 720p/performance. The only way you could have seen the ever unmatched DLSS for PC kings instead of the plebean FSR is through a compressed youtube video so your opinion is literally invalid. I hope I am being sarcastic enough.",Negative
Intel,"The problem is some (if not most) games have such a bad TAA it might as well be true, and if often cannot but turned off.",Negative
Intel,"""We could"" but not profitable. Just let imagine these games does not exist in our reality.",Negative
Intel,You didn't understand. It's another Swiss knife engine,Negative
Intel,"It is indeed not a great situation. Things like this shouldn't be forced on, and it leaves me feeling like they haven't given the devs enough time to optimize the settings.",Negative
Intel,It works because most consoles players are noobs they don't care about the tech. They just want to sit on the couch and play. I'm hoping we see them start working more on FSR3 and upgrading older games to it. And you are right nvidia will keep moving forward but so will AMD. They may never catch them since they have a head start.,Positive
Intel,AMD just released drivers for Alan Wake 2 that fixed the flickering while using FSR.,Neutral
Intel,The PS5 has a 6700.,Neutral
Intel,">I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?   Not exactly. It's a custom quasi-RDNA2 design (has the improved RDNA2 compute units, but it's missing a few features such as fully-DX12-compliant mesh shaders and VRS-capable ROPs).  For most purposes, it's pretty comparable to a 6700 (non-XT), with the same number of CUs (36), and similar clockspeeds.",Neutral
Intel,"Oh, wow. I didn't know that. But it'll likely be on a similar level as UE5, right?",Positive
Intel,Next gen DOES NOT MEAN that your CURRENT GEN hardware can run it well for sure... Why don't people get that?,Negative
Intel,That reminds me to grab moss 1 and 2. I just got a quest 3.   Agreed though. I’ve been waiting for kingdom hearts 3 to come to steam for so long that I’m basically going to skip it at this point. It’s still stuck on the epic game store.,Neutral

Intel,TAA,Neutral
Intel,Temporal anti aliasing.,Neutral
Intel,"TAA is the devil. it forces a blur on every frame, and only gets worse as the resolution goes lower. its why fsr, xess, and dlss can look better than """"native"""" because it doesnt use the horrid plain taa solution so many games do. and why dlaa, and fsraa are so important and need to replace taa completely",Negative
Intel,"Ahh, welcome to r/FuckTAA",Neutral
Intel,Even 4K looks blurry with some implementations of TAA,Negative
Intel,they're giving you the bare minimum until your upgrade!,Neutral
Intel,Because they are built with upscaling in mind so they have a blurry looks intentionally as it works best with aggressive upscaling.,Neutral
Intel,"Not even close, you're completely out of your mind. The 5700xt is 9% faster than the 5700. The 1080ti is **32%** faster than a 1070 and the 2080 is **19%** faster than the 2070.   Source from techpowerup: [https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-5700-xt.c3339](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-5700-xt.c3339)",Negative
Intel,"Well the difference is only 256 shaders more on the 5700xt. The 5700xt has 2560 shaders and the 5700 2304. That's 11% more. That's not that much.  The 1080ti has 86% more cuda cores than the 1070, as well as more and faster memory. I would not compare now so haha",Neutral
Intel,"The 5700 and 5700xt is more like a 1070 and 1070ti situation. It's not that big a gap, and you can close it even tighter because the majority of RX 5700 cards can be flashed to a 5700xt bios tightening the gap farther.",Neutral
Intel,"The 1070 was released in 2016. Its already the end of 2023. That card belong to ps4 era. Wake up.   People in this sub are delusional, really.",Negative
Intel,Those are some dumbass expectations. Maybe you should correct them instead of blaming the developers for it.,Negative
Intel,"The 6500XT offers $200 2016 performance. In fact its often worse because of how gimped it is interface wise. Its one of the worst products released in recent years.  Its not the game developers fault AMD pretty much rebadged the RX 480 4 times and they can't be expected to sink their optimization to that level.  RX 480, RX580, RX 5500XT and RX6500XT are virtualy the same product performance wise. RX 5500XT is the most consistent one of the lot offering a somewhat more modern arhitecture in its 8GB variant. The 6500XT on the other hand while on a newer arhitecture is an unmitigated disaster that is on par at best and sinks even below the RX580 when memory, bus and PCIE interface constrained.  The console baseline is around 6700XT/2070 Super/3060ti level. People better get used to that as its gonna become or already has become the norm for 1080p high settings gaming. The 5700 is upwards of 30% slower by default while also having less hardware features. Its gonna become the minimum norm going forward alongside the 2060's of your time.",Negative
Intel,"the 1070 was 2016, the 5700 was 2019. While both not new its not 10 years old like the PS4 (2013)",Neutral
Intel,This is literally only true if you use path tracing. I think you're trying to insinuate the game is unoptimized when it just scales really high with visual features if your hardware supports it. It straight up runs great for the visual features it uses.,Neutral
Intel,"That was exclusive to console releases, no? And never to the point of replacing AA sharpening and rendering the game from 720p…",Neutral
Intel,No I havent. AMD is bigger than Epic.,Negative
Intel,"Right, you'll have different complaints but complaints none the less even though the new Ultra might still look slightly better prior gen games and offer high FPS but people would complain that the graphics are not advancing fast enough, they look the same etc etc.  Yah those days are likely gone but it's hard to say if it's because the game is unoptimized or if the dev is really pushing the limits of what they can do graphically and use upscaling as a buffer because what they have in mind, or what they intend to show is too taxing for current hardware. We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it. This is why I've never in my life ever pre-ordered a game. I still don't understand why people do it (esp now that games are digital) but lot of people do. Then again I've never really paid for a ""skin"" or some other visual add-on so maybe that's what attracts people.  I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets. The presets are all relative anyways. There's no universal settings that define what each preset represents.  I just don't get the outrage on these minimum spec sheets compared to what the game is showing graphically. At least wait until it releases and we have some hard data.",Negative
Intel,"I'm also a dev dood sometimes it's literally a ""foutage de geugle"" I had a friend who talk about how shit devs in EA (the people who's making the engine) code and doesn't optimise",Negative
Intel,"The commenter I replied to said there wasn't a big generational improvement for GPUs, while I said there was. But I agree that 4080 is expensive for what it offers.",Neutral
Intel,It was the same price as a 3090 at launch and offers 90% more performance.  It was definitely a generational leap.,Positive
Intel,It's software ray tracing which isn't accelerated by hardware.,Neutral
Intel,and i guess it can be hard to tell if ram is dual or single rank with just two sticks of it too.,Neutral
Intel,>might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.  I was pointing out that 1070 doesn't have hardware RT either.,Negative
Intel,So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?,Negative
Intel,"Why not make it toggleable though, you can choose other graphics settings so it makes no sense. Most people don't play games with RT enabled",Negative
Intel,Still kinda weird that they put the RX 5700/A750 on the same ballpark as the 1070... Being that the newer GPUs actually perform closer to a 1080(Ti).,Neutral
Intel,Sounds like improperly configured negative LOD bias. If you have Nvidia you can fix it with nvinspector. On AMD there's nothing you can do IIRC if Devs mess it up.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly what I'm telling them all the time, that I can see difference in textures, in hair, fences, powerlines etc. And every time I get downvoted by the army of ""but it looks better then native"". I feel like majority of that sub needs to go get a prescription for new glasses",Negative
Intel,"So if you stopped measuring who's bigger, why do you think I have no access to DLSS? Tested on rig with 4080 on a C2 42"" screen. Once you stop thinking with the tip of your head where probably Nvidia's logo is tattooed or maybe Jensen's face, who knows, you could come to realization that one person have access to more hardware then only his personal rig.  Do I say that FSR is better then DLSS? No! Both of them have their issues, but none of them is better then native. Keep on fanboying mate, instead of providing normal convoy as grownups",Neutral
Intel,I don't think YOU understand what you're talking about.  Did you seriously expect Snowdrop to be something used in like one game and then discarded completely?,Negative
Intel,"The thing is: creating good looking lightning with RT is much easier than with prebaked illumination. I can fully understand, why developers of new games are using RT as the basis of their game.",Positive
Intel,Minimum requirements go up as games get/look better. They probably made this game with the series s as the minimum. Low settings probably looks better than high in most games.   Rt for the last few years has been added on top of already complete games. Now games are being made with rt as the standard and they would have to manually do a ton of extra work to support 7+ year old hardware. It's the same as having to drop support for last gen consoles to be able to deliver a better game.,Neutral
Intel,"And still - superior upscaling makes it worth paying extra, RT on higher end is worth paying extra. AMD even this gen doesn't undercut price by enough, especially in EU where power efficiency also play a role. For example, assuming I'm gonna use GPU for 2 gens, then I save ~90-100€ with my usage just on electricity alone. I know it's over period of 4 years, but still it's price difference that will recoup over time, even if I have to pay extra upfront. AMD is simply no longer a value proposition.",Neutral
Intel,"They did not, lol - that fixes completely different thing, not the FSR caused shimmering edges.",Negative
Intel,Both excellent 👌 Down the Rabbit Hole was another solid one.,Positive
Intel,"RE4 came out this year.  Anyway the difference between us is I don't think any lighting effect is worth a $1,000 GPU using 1080p resolution and 60fps, but I know many disagree. That's life.",Neutral
Intel,"3600 and the 3300x was built with the TSMC 7nm if i recall, that was 2018 cutting edge tech. and somehow in gaming it's already obsolete. i was planning to replace mine with 5700x  but i cancel it because it's still very much capable for what i do now. but now after UE5 i think i'll reconsider it again, maybe even as far as 5800X3D",Neutral

Intel,"Out of curiosity what resolution do you usually game at and at what distance? I find taa usually looks pretty good in modern games, but I'm also playing on a TV (48 inches but I'm not at monitor distance anymore). When I played on my 1920x1200 monitor I HATED TAA, well, not as much as fxaa, but moreso than smaa, and I missed msaa or SGSSAA with a passion. Now on the TV at 4k (lol, usually not on a 6700xt), 1440p, or even 1080p I find TAA can do a pretty decent job paired with varying levels of the Radeon sharpness adjustment in the adrenaline drivers. But again, probably due to viewing distance.  Looks leagues better than FXAA and I prefer it to SMAA now. But again, I'm sitting further away and tweaking sharpening to my liking. FSR2 seems to be a wash most of the time but the performance gain is worth it.",Positive
Intel,You dumbass do understand that even the console version of the recent games are total mess? Alan wake 2 have to run on reduced settings to even reach 30fps on xbox/PS. Callisto protocol used to have frametime issue on consoles. Console ports still targets 30fps on quality settings with upscaling while target should be 60fps with 120fps for performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, seems you are correct, it was the ps4 pro that came out in 2016, still, I wouldn't expect that to be capable of running some of the games we are seeing now without some serious compromises.",Neutral
Intel,I never said that Alan Wake 2 is unoptimised. I just said that even a 4090 can’t max out the game at native 4K resolution.,Negative
Intel,epic is tencent...,Neutral
Intel,"In terms of absolute numbers sure, 3090 always had a stupid price tho for being 10% faster than a 3080.   In terms of performance per dollar the 4090 even at 2x 3080 performance was worse value since you pay 1600 not 1400.",Negative
Intel,"Yes, you either have to get the spec sheet of the RAM modules (That even then it may not specify if it's a single/dual rank module) or test it in a system and use HWinfo/CPU-Z. Not as straightforward as dual channel that's mostly just using two identical modules.",Neutral
Intel,You don't need RT hardware to do software RT. That's what I'm saying.,Neutral
Intel,"For this particular game, there is a software fallback. Also, even if we did get a game that mandated hardware support for RT they'd still likely build it with console in mind so even RDNA2 GPUs shouldn't have issues",Neutral
Intel,"The first RT/DLSS capable cards are 5 years old now, way older than the current consoles. You are definitely not being left behind if you're only outdated by 1 gen lol",Neutral

Intel,Games running poorly on computers weaker than current gen consoles isn't exactly anything new.,Neutral

Intel,You are stuck playing older games. Unless someone can find a way to disable it with a mod.,Negative
Intel,> So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?  A gen old is second gen RT e.g. rtx 3000.  We're halfway through the third RT/matrix generation right now.,Negative
Intel,Yes hah,Neutral
Intel,"The 3090 or 6950xt will very likely run this game extremely well, they're a gen old.",Positive
Intel,"For the AMD GPU, it's probably because minimum will be the max it will support. Medium probably requires Hardware RT.  For Intel, I don’t know. Perhaps it signal not so great optimization for Intel GPUs...",Neutral
Intel,DLSS is very strong in thin lines like fences & hair. Much better than most TAA solutions. Not sure about FSR in general.  An example: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6erA6BVkAAuf_M?format=jpg&name=large  Only DLSS resolves the lines properly.,Positive
Intel,"I mean, it's not that black and white. Quality upscaling to 1080 will obviously be more noticeable than 4k. Maybe you *can* tell the difference between 4k native and dlss quality, but people aren't gonna believe you unless you prove it with some kind of blind test, but I doubt you'd be willing to go out of your way to do that.  Even if you could, the benefits of better aa might outweight some negligible drop in textures or whatever it is upscaling reduces.

Intel,Nice. It’s on the list. Thanks man,Positive
Intel,Yes.... 7nm was but 4 cores the actual important thing was obsolete like 10 or 12 years ago.,Neutral
Intel,Probably because TAA is (unfortunately) more prevalent than it ever was.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, most people are FINE with it. Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  The thing is, you have sharpening filters today. You can adjust the sharpening for TAA. You can make it look oversharpened if you want. There's driver level sharpening for both AMD and NVIDIA. Both also have software sharpening filters.  And DLSS and FSR bot have sharpening sliders.  There's 3 ways to adjust how blurry and how sharp the game looks for everyone. It's a non issue and even Digital Foundry acknowledges the benefits of TAA for game devs vs things like the blur. At the end of the day, these games are looking great...in this era, with exceptions. Not all games are blur. The whole blur thing was like in the past 4 years since upscalers started and TAA became the norm. But with all the sharpening options, and with devs actually used to making TAA not so soft looking, things are definitely getting a lot better for TAA.",Neutral
Intel,Oh my bad if I read that wrong,Negative
Intel,And I'm saying 1070 doesn't have hardware RT so it's just as gimped as AMD cards when doing RT.,Negative

Intel,I'm on a 6700XT. 🙇. I just feel very shocked that I would probably need a gpu upgrade soon. With the demands of new games. Also 1440p ruined me.,Negative
Intel,"Technically makes sense, but they can just make RT something you can toggle between Software/Hardware and they also could just add the Vega 56 in the requirement sheet being that was AMD's competitor to the 1070 or they could've added the GTX 1080(Ti)/RTX 2060(Super) into the sheet.  On Intel's side they only have the A580 as the closest GPU to a 1070, even when it's too similar to the A750 performance wise :/",Neutral
Intel,"It is that black and white for me. I can immediately see the added image softness from upscaling, and it's especially prevalent with DLSS 2.5+ unless you enable a sharpening filter. DLAA also has weird issues like blurring textures (almost like it reverts to initial mipmap) while moving, usually at mid-distance from camera. It's too distracting and I have to go back to regular TAA. Immediately goes away.  1440p to 2160p is better than 720p to 1080p, but it's still noticeable. Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible? No. Actually changing monitor resolution outside of native and having all UI elements scaled looks terrible. That was what we used to do and upscaling is much better than that alternative. LCD panels need to stay at native signal resolution and GPU should scale render resolutions.",Negative
Intel,"And you look at static image all the time while gaming? It's different story when movement is involved, that's where you find all the artefacts you get. Static image doesn't tell a thing when it comes to gaming",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, and that's driving me crazy. I really couldn't stand it in Cyberpunk (in other titles it's either hit or miss), that I play it in native 4k instead.",Negative
Intel,"Wouldn't phrase it like that tough. I had that choice too in January, and actually by going 4070Ti instead of 7900XT I would be able to play Cyberpunk in higher fidelity and better frames then on mine, because AMD cooked FSR3.0 almost a year in the oven, and God knows how long it will take for CDPR to add it to the game, if ever considering that active development on game is ended and they are on bug fixing sprint right now. Also AMD needs to fix FSR in general, because how it works with smaller details like hair and fences is awful. But don't get me wrong, I love my card, just feel I git sold on features that would come handy right kow instead of when I don't need them anymore",Neutral
Intel,"Sorry mate, guess I need to read comments early morning instead of late night, just saw that last bit. My apologies. I'm just tired of upscalare wars whatever sub I go, and green team fanboys screaming that ""FSR is shit, DLSS is better then native"" and then throwing around static images for comparison",Negative
Intel,"It's for textures, not object edges from FSR use, lol. Two completely different things",Neutral
Intel,"people echoing the same shit like ""ooh 4C is obsolete, you need to upgrade that geriatric cpu"". 4C is still solid for gaming (ofc no UE5) and literally anything beside doing compute intensive professional workloads.",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening makes the image less blurry, but it doesn't recover the texture detail lost from TAA blur.",Negative
Intel,"""Even Nvidia foundry""   \---   they are like chief proponents of blur-tech and they don't care about how sharp and easy-to-see the image is. TAA flattens the image so you can't see which objects are far and which are near, you have to strain your eyes and mind to determine that which is unbearable to many. Just give us option to disable it even if it breaks some effects (which is just lazy thing to do on the side of devs)",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening fixes blur, not clearity. That is TAA destroys+add significant ghosting no matter the implementation.      Sharpening looks was worse than the normal cleairy of games, it's not the same thing at all.      >Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  We are mad because it being forced 1 and 2 it's being used to hide lazy effects that break without temporal frame smearing. People are now punished for turning off forced frame smearing.",Negative
Intel,And I'm saying that maybe the GTX 1070 is better at even software RT compared to AMD cards with no RT hardware. GTX 10 series card did get RTX support through CUDA even though they were horribly bad at it. Older AMD cards with no RT hardware didn't get any support like that from AMD.,Neutral
Intel,"You're not forced to use upscaling though. Unless you replied to the wrong person this is about ray tracing, which can be run at native just fine. If your GPU can't handle RT at native res, then just use upscaling.",Neutral
Intel,The minimum requirements for this game includes de 1070: a 7-year-old gpu from 2016.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm not really shocked, and was out there telling people not to buy those cards on day 1 in large part because of their deficiencies in RT performance and complete lack of matrix accelerators (which Nvidia and Intel have both made a large part of their architecture and got shockingly good results with - DLSS and matrix-XeSS are twice as good as FSR)",Negative
Intel,5700 was probably the lowest AMD card they had to test with.,Neutral
Intel,"It also looks better in gameplay, less ghosting, less shimmering, less aliasing.   So which one looks better? You clearly see the difference in textures/fences/powerline, right?  I even made it easier for you, both images are 1080p output.",Positive
Intel,I personally didn't try DLSS even once but FSR 2.0 does have shimmering I notice to various degrees. It was very noticable on fur in Ratchet & Clank cutscenes for example. Overall I am just happy my 5700xt could still keep up with 1440p.,Positive
Intel,Hmm yeah whatever you want to believe and let's you sleep.  Have a nice day.,Positive
Intel,AMD CAS is aimed to restore detail,Neutral
Intel,"They aren’t chief proponents of anything, TAAU has been popular for well over a decade at this point and it’s the default approach for consoles (checkerboarding has moire and aliasing issues) and digital foundry simply recognizes this is the reality of how the console world has settled on doing graphics.",Neutral
Intel,The problem with Nvidia is they are massively overpriced. One 4080 would probably cost the same as my whole build or more.,Negative
Intel,"Yes I see which one looks better, and as I said before it's a static image. While I didn't use upscaling in this same exact example, I can go by my own experience and tell that it doesn't look better then native let's say in same Cyberpunk or any other game. And I will beleive my own eyes on my own screen then static images tossed around. TBH, in my opinion it all depends on screen and screen size too, as to me that difference between upscaled and native was less noticible on my old 27"" 1440p screen then it is now on 42"" 4k. DLAA tough, that's another story",Neutral
Intel,"I tried both, and neither of them are better then native as people tend to claim. In my testing FSR have big problem with smaller details like hair, fur, fences, powerlines and as you mentioned, you get severe shimmering effect. I really hope AMD will keep on working on it, an try to get away from that. But DLSS also adds shimmer, it's just less visible then in FSR (atleast in my testing on Cyberpunk pre 2.0), and whatever upscaling method I've used I also could see that image is upscaled (lower res textures here and there etc.). I like idea being upscaling tech, it helps prolong life of GPUs, and for more powerful GPUs to run higher settings with more fidelity, but there's still work to do on them as they aren't perfect yet.",Negative
Intel,Yeah but a 3060ti didn't,Neutral
Intel,"In Cyberpunk you are not comparing upscaling vs no upscaling at the same settings though. You are comparing low RT native vs path traced upscaling and at 4K, the decission there is absolutely clear. On my 4k OLED screen, upscaled PT is so clearly the way to go, there is no competition.",Neutral
Intel,"The gameplay looks exactly like the image + your typical TAA/DLSS smearing. And as I said, in my example DLSS also looks better in gameplay, because as you see... native has a ton of aliasing which is super noticeable while playing (shimmering). There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling. Talking about native is nonesense, just image quality counts and thats were DLSS or even FSR 2 (some games) gets better and better. There is a reason why consoles use it... it looks better than without it.",Positive

Intel,"I mean, Path tracing is to Ray tracing, what Ray tracing is too rasterization.",Neutral
Intel,When Cyberpunk first came out the 3090 only got 20 fps in RT Psycho mode.  https://tpucdn.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-founders-edition/images/cyberpunk-2077-rt-3840-2160.png  Still does  Fast forward just one gem and you don't see anyone saying its demanding with many able to get RT Psycho on thier cards as new cards got faster.  Give it 2 gens and you are going to get 4k60 here.  Gpu will improve and get faster.,Neutral
Intel,"Look at that, my 6700XT is just 19fps slower than the RTX 4090 in this title.",Negative
Intel,It's a good thing nobody has to actually play it native.,Neutral
Intel,Well good thing literally nobody is doing that…,Negative
Intel,The future is not in native resolution so this is really pointless information.  Cyberpunk looks absolutelt mindblowlingy insane with all the extra graphical bells and whistles it has gotten over the years and with Nvidia’s technology it runs so damn smooth as well.,Positive
Intel,4.3fps lol. No amount of upscaling is going to fix that and make it playable. People were saying the 7900xtx had 3090ti levels of RT when it launched. A 4060 ti is 50% faster then it.,Negative
Intel,That's actually pretty amazing for any GPU to get a metric in frames per second instead of minuites per frame.,Positive
Intel,"Meh I get like 90+ fps with everything cranked with RR, FG and DLSS(Balanced) toggled on with my 4090 @ 4k.  Path tracing does introduce ghosting which is annoying buts not really noticeable most times but at the same time with RR enabled it removes shimmering on 99% of objects that is normally introduced with DLSS so I am willing to compromise.   Honestly as someone who used to have a 7900XTX I am disappointed with AMD its clear that AI tech in gaming is the way forward and they just seem so far behind Nvidia now and even Intel(going by some preview stuff). FSR is just not even comparable anymore.",Negative
Intel,Who cares when it looks worse than with dlss and ray reconstruction on top of running a lot worse? Native res 4k is pointless.,Negative
Intel,"Well the upscaling in this game is really good, DLSS with ray reconstructions AI accelerated denoiser provides better RT effects than the game at native with its native Denoiser.  Also Path tracing scales perfectly with resolution so upscaling provides massive gains. using DLSS quality doubles performance to 40fps, and dlss balanced gives 60fps on average, performance about 70-80 or 4x native 4K, that includes the 10-15% performance gain RR gives as well over the native denoiser as well.  I've been playing with about 60fps on average 50-70. with DLSS Balanced and RR and its been amazing. I don't like frame gen tho since it causes VRR flickers on my screen",Positive
Intel,"Running Ray Tracing or Path Tracing without DLSS or Ray Reconstruction is like intentionally going into a battlefield without any gear whatsoever, it's absolutely pointless and suicidal, what we can clearly see here though is top of the line 7900 XTX losing against already mediocre mid-range 4060 Ti by over 50%, which is just beyond embarrassing for AMD Radeon.  All this says to me is AMD Radeon need to get their shit together and improve their RT / PT performance, otherwise they will continue to lose more Marketshare on GPU department no matter how hard their fanboys thinks that they are pointless features, just like DLSS was back on 2020 right?  Also, with my 4070 Ti OC i can run it at average of over 60 FPS at 1440p DF optimized settings with DLSS Balanced + Ray Reconstruction without even using DLSS Frame Gen, with it on i can get over 80+ FPS",Negative
Intel,Running this way means you lose RR…why in the world would you run at native 4k?  It’s completely pointless now with RR.,Negative
Intel,Im having 80 fps  thanks to dlss 3.5  and its looking better than ever,Positive
Intel,"Why would I run native? I have amazing DLSS, ray reconstruction for huge image gains and frame gen. Nvidia offering all the goodies.",Positive
Intel,"I have a 13900KF-4090 rig and a 7800X3D-7900XTX rig. They are connected to a C2 OLED and to a Neo G9.  I've been holding on to play the game till 2.0 update. I've tried many times with different ray-tracing options and they all look good and all. But in the end I closed them all, turned back to Ultra Quality without ray-tracing and started playing the game over 120FPS.  This is a good action fps game now. I need high fps with as low latency as possible. So who cares about ray-tracing and path-tracing.  Yeah ray-tracing and path-tracing are good. But we are at least 2-3 generations away for them to become mainstream. When they are easily enabled on mid-range gpus with high-refresh rate monitors, they will be good and usable then :)",Positive
Intel,"If you have the HW, go all out. That's why we spend on these things.  I'm getting the best experience you can get in the premiere visual showcase of a good game.   It's path tracing. It isn't cheap but the fact that we have DLSS and FG with Ray reconstruction is a Godsend. It looks stunning and it's still early in development.",Positive

Intel,"""Get Nvidia if you want a good ray tracing experience""  Yes Nvidia GPUs give a better ray tracing experience but is it really worth it if you are required to turn on DLSS? Imo, the more AI-upscaling you have to turn on, the worse the Nvidia purchase is.   I have a 6900XT and I will readily admit that the RT experience (ultra RT, no path tracing) at native 1080p resolution is ok, like 30-45 FPS (around 50 on medium RT settings), but if I turn RT lighting off (so RT shadows, sunlight, and reflections are still present) suddenly I get pretty consistent 60 FPS (i left my frames tied to monitor refresh rate, so 60 FPS is my max) and i can't tell the damn difference at native 1080p compared to RT medium or Ultra.   So would I spend another $400-$1000 to get an imperceptible outcome (imperceptible to me that is)? Most definitely not.",Negative

Intel,"Once they introduced this dlss upscaling anti-lag all these gimmicks I don't think we've seen true 4K native and almost anything lately.  This is maybe one game that does look that good but many of the games don't look that great and have some really serious system requirements when there are games that look much better and are much better optimized.  Companies are taking shortcuts, instead of optimizing they give you suboptimal and use FSR dlss all these gimmicks.  Don't get me wrong I always thought it was great for people who wanted to reach a certain frames per second someone with a weaker system to allow them to play at least the minimal at a steady frame rate.  It just seems like this is the normal now non-optimized games.  The 4090 is a beast if you could only get about 20 frames native with Ray tracing it tells you everything you need to know about Ray tracing.  It needs to be reworked that needs to be a new system I believe one real engine has it built in in a certain way probably not as good as Ray tracing directly.  To me it seems like ray tracing is hampering many games that tried to add it, too much focus on that instead of actual making a good game.

I am not saying this whole Cyberpunk thing is exactly the same, but it's essentially similar. In all honesty, turning everything up to 11 on my 3090 doesn't net much visual gain beyond some mirror like reflections and nothing I really care about when actually playing the game (compared to standard High/Ultra) and not pixel peeping, which seems to be the new game now for people buying expensive GPUs, so they can justify their purchase. Meanwhile, everyone else just gets on with enjoying video games instead of living vicariously through someone's 4090 at LOL 1080p",Negative
Intel,Starfield is peaking around the corner.,Neutral
Intel,starfield as well,Neutral
Intel,I remember when physx was so demanding people had a dedicated 2nd Nvidia graphics card just to turn the setting on in Arkham City. Now it's considered so cheap to calculate that we just do it on the CPU lmao,Neutral
Intel,The new Crysis,Neutral
Intel,"I wouldn’t be so optimistic. Transistor shrinking is crazy hard now, and TSMC is asking everyone to mortgage their house to afford it.",Negative
Intel,How long until a $200 card can do that?,Neutral
Intel,Most improvement is probably going to AI software more than hardware in the next few years.,Positive
Intel,"8800GT giving advice to 4090:  “I used to be 'with it. ' But then they changed what 'it' was. Now what I'm with isn't 'it' and what's 'it' seems weird and scary to me. It'll happen to you!""",Neutral
Intel,GPU need to have its own garage by then,Neutral
Intel,Yep! Insane how fast things change.,Neutral
Intel,"Most likely there will be no gpu that supports path tracing and gives you native 4k 120fps in 5 years, maybe even in 10 years.  The technology has slowed down a bit. It’s increasingly more challenging to make more dense chips.  That’s why Intel has been struggling for many years already and every iteration of their cpus gives only minor improvements. AMD went with chiplets but this approach has its own problems.  Nvidia stands out only because of AI. Raw performance increase is still not enough to play native 4k even without ray tracing.",Negative
Intel,Yeah rtx 12060 with 9.5 gb Vram will be a monster,Neutral
Intel,I'm willing to bet hardware improvement will come to a halt before that.,Neutral
Intel,"In 10 years AI based upscaling will be so good, no one will want to natively render unless they are generating training data",Negative
Intel,10 is too much. Give it 5.,Neutral
Intel,Transistor density advancements have been declining for a good while now. We can't expect hardware performance gains of old to continue into the future,Negative
Intel,Like the 1080 barely doing 4k30 and now we have gpus that do 4k120 id way heavier games.  Its still weord to me to see 4k120,Negative
Intel,But then the current gen games of that era will run like this. The cycle continues,Neutral
Intel,TRUE! i think 5-10 years was the actual point in time where anybody should have paid their hard earned dollar for raytracing gpus. instead ppl dished out $1000s for the RTX2080/Ti and now are sitting on them waiting for raytracing to happen for them xD,Neutral
Intel,Who knows what new tech will be out in even 4 years lol,Neutral
Intel,"And that’s when I’ll turn on this setting in my games. Fuck having to pay $1600 for a sub 30fps experience. Path tracing is far from being a viable option, it’s more like a proof of concept at this point.",Negative
Intel,"You wish, GPU makers have stagnated like it's crazy, even the graphics have peaked. I expected to see CGI level graphics like Transformers now",Negative
Intel,"...but will cost your everlasting soul, body, firstborn and parents. If it's on sale.",Neutral
Intel,It is path trancing though. The technology used by Pixar to make Toy Story 4 (though they spent up to 1200 CPU hours for one frame) Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story. And they had their supercomputers working on it. It is a miracle of modern technology that it even runs real time.,Positive
Intel,"You basically need a 4090 to crack 60 fps at 1440p w/ dlss on quality without frame gen. It looks good, but not good enough to run out and buy a 4090.",Negative
Intel,"Same card, I just turned off RT at 4K. 75-120fps is better than 40 with muddy but accurate reflections",Neutral
Intel,"The 7900xtx is one of the worst gpus iv ever had lol on paper it looks so so good, In games it just play isn’t. Fsr is garbage, 4080 mops the floor with it :( plus the drivers from amd besides starfield have been awful this generation",Negative
Intel,I think that most of the progress will go together with software tricks and upscalers.,Neutral
Intel,"lol. And you missed the 2080Ti.   Every result under 10 fps is just to be ignored, it isn't representing anything outside of ""woot, the card managed to chuck a frame our way"".",Negative
Intel,That's VRAM for you,Neutral
Intel,we are counting decimals of fps its just all margin of error.,Neutral
Intel,If you buy a card with low ram that card is for right now only lol,Neutral
Intel,Wake me up when a $250 GPU can run this at 1080p.,Neutral
Intel,Well DLSS isn't best. DLAA is,Negative
Intel,Reviews have been saying that the game looks better with DLSS than native. Not to mention runs extremely better.,Positive
Intel,Can’t you just disable TAA? Or do you just have to live with the ghosting?,Neutral
Intel,TAA is garbage in everything. TAA and FSR can both get fucked,Negative
Intel,"Yeah. 70 to 100fps on a 4080, but with 3440x1440 and DLSS-quality-FG-RR (nvidia needs new nomenclature....)",Neutral
Intel,"same, high refreshrate at 4k with optimized settings + PT + FG. With a 4080 of course, it's insane that it can look and run this great.",Positive
Intel,"Not exactly. Path tracing is just ray tracing, but cranked up to 99% with the least amount of rasterization possible.",Neutral
Intel,"> Give it 2 gens and you are going to get 4k60 here.  Assuming the 5090 literally doubles a 4090 (unlikely), that only gets us to 4K 40hz.  Assuming a 6090 doubles that, 80. which won't be bad.  Going with more conservative 50% boosts. 5090 will give 30. 6090 will give 45.  And i feel like 50% is being very generous, as nvidia have claimed moores law is dead and they can't advance beyond a 4090 by much. I'd guess we get 30% uplift in 5090 and maybe 10-15% uplift in 6090. So we'd still be under 4K30.",Neutral
Intel,Imagine buying a 4090 and then using upscaling.,Neutral
Intel,Path tracing is so much more demanding than ray tracing due to light scattering being modelled. It is a marvel it even runs.,Positive
Intel,PC gaming is in Crysis.,Neutral
Intel,Well it's a good thing 99.999999% of PC gamers don't give a shit about ray or path tracing.,Negative
Intel,You're the first other person other than myself I've run into that had an XTX but ended up with a 4090 in the end.,Neutral
Intel,"Plus frame generation works very well in Cyberpunk in terms of image quality. In some games, you need to get closer to ~80 fps output for an acceptable image quality with FG. But the FG in CP2077 is decent with 60 fps output, ~~and I get ~65-70 fps output with quality DLSS + FG at 4k on a 4090.~~ EDIT: I misremembered what I was getting. With path tracing, DLSS quality, frame generation, and ray reconstruction, I got 80.1 fps with the benchmark!  Of course there's the matter of latency, and the latency of CP2077 with FG output of ~65-70 fps isn't great. So I'll often use DLSS balanced + FG. Thanks to ray reconstruction, this now looks very close enough native 4k (to my eyes), with acceptable latency (to me), at a high framerate output.",Positive
Intel,"Nvidia features are always useless until AMD copies them a year or two later, only then they become great features 😁",Positive
Intel,"Tbh, list the games that have ray tracing right now. Pretty few.  It's not about being a fanboy of amd, but ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick, not because it's unnoticeable or bad, just because it's not ""popular"" (I myself really like it). I would personally go amd over nvidia because those 50 or so euros more that nvidia has against the amd counter parts simply are too much for just better rt and  dlss. I could spend those for a better amd card with generally better performance.  Regarding dlss, personally I would just lower the graphics before resorting to kinda bad generated frames, fsr even worse. But that's my point of view.  I find that amd still has to fix some driver issues but other than that, they are a fine brand. (so is nvidia)",Neutral
Intel,Yeh because native 4k looks worse than dlss + RR 4k,Negative
Intel,"Yeah the game with DLSS, RR and path tracing at 1440p looks amazing and with very high fps",Positive
Intel,What's the point of having $5000 PC when you're still gonna have literally the same graphics as $1000 PC then?,Negative
Intel,"This is a tech demo. That's the whole point. It's not really playable yet, but the game really is meant to showcase what is possible in the future and how close we are getting. That's what Nvidia is doing here by funding this whole project.  Crysis who many people are comparing this to, was in itself quite revolutionary for its time. The destructible environment in Crysis to this day holds up, and that was it's killer feature really.  You're gonna have swings at the future that miss as well, and that's ok.",Positive
Intel,"Did you try DLSS?  Imagine getting down voted for asking if he was using DLSS. What a fragile community. Sometimes it's okay to use DLSS, other times you better not or people will come to your house with torches",Negative
Intel,VRAM,Neutral
Intel,"Depends on what you are after i guess, is it worth it for me? Absolutely, DLSS+FG+RR with PT is a great experience.",Positive
Intel,still better than 90% of games in 2023,Positive
Intel,Arguably better now Ray Reconstruction has been added. It's quite a big image quality upgrade.,Positive
Intel,"…no it does not, unfortunately. Have you seen the artifacting in Cyberpunk?",Negative
Intel,"Someone ate up the marketing. I often see people wonder why games are so unoptimized today, your answer is right here. \^",Negative
Intel,All graphics you see on your computer screen is fake,Negative
Intel,Path tracing is more demanding than Ray tracing,Neutral
Intel,"That's why I downscale from 1440p to 1080p, running DLSS and using Contrast Limited Sharpening. It looks better than native resolution and still performs well.",Positive
Intel,I guess between the 3090 and the 4070,Neutral
Intel,Yep hahaha,Neutral
Intel,RemindMe! 7 years,Neutral
Intel,"No, this tech is around so game developers can sell more copies of their games by making them look better. The only reason why Nvidia is winning is because their GPUs are much better at intensive ray-tracing.",Positive
Intel,"This is an absurd, fanboyish thought lmao",Negative
Intel,dont let novidia marketing see this youll get down voted into oblivion,Negative
Intel,I would still argue it's still in proof of concept stage. The tech will only become viable once the flagship GPU'S start getting 4k 60fps at native. That will the allow the lower end GPU'S to get 4k 60 or 1440p 60 upscaled.,Neutral
Intel,I mean I have no problem playing at 30fps dlss balance at 1080p DF optimized settings on a 2080ti with pathtracing idc what anyone says RT/PT is the future it just looks so much better than Rasterization,Positive
Intel,"Possibly a little more. Assuming that the leaked 1.7x improvement is right and path tracing performance scales the same, that would be about 34 fps at 4k native. Might be possible to hit 60fps or close to it with DLSS Quality.",Neutral
Intel,It could as well do 60fps if Nvidia adds a lot of path tracing HW into the GPU.,Neutral
Intel,Fanboyism of both kinds is bad,Negative
Intel,"It won't end, but hopefully we see games that have art designed with RT lighting and reflections in mind.  Cyberpunk isn't it. We'd need a full rebuild of the game, every location, every asset and surface remade, so it looks like originally intended by the artists.",Neutral
Intel,Since it needs more than 10gb vram,Positive
Intel,Cyberpunk is more optimized than majority of games that came out in last two years. Just because you can't run it at 4k 120 fps with path tracing doesn't mean it's not optimized.,Negative
Intel,It’s not unoptimized at all. Game runs great for the quality of the graphics. You guys just don’t understand the insane amount of power path tracing takes. The fact you can do it at all rn is insane but once again people just throw “unoptimized” at it because they don’t understand the technical marvel happening in front of their eyes.,Negative
Intel,"No, this game is actually very well optimized. It's just extremely demanding at 4k native, which is why DLSS exists.  It would be unoptimized if it ran like this while looking like nothing special, but this is probably the game with the best graphics, period. At the very least, it's certainly the game with the best lighting.",Positive
Intel,"and people will be like ""well RT is the future""  raster was fine for over 15 years and raster games look great but we get it we must let incompetent game devs and their bosses make shit quality games because average gamer is ready to spend $100 to pre-order electronic version of horse shit and then justify it for years because they can't admit they wasted money",Negative
Intel,It's settled that you have no idea what you talking about,Negative
Intel,Its full path tracing u cannot really optimize this much.,Negative
Intel,"It always did. Most games don't scale well, Cyberpunk does.  Look at the last two years of pc ports and you will understand how cyberpunk looks and performs like it's black magic.",Neutral
Intel,"Baked illumination requires you to choose where to add light sources and how the lighting is applied to everything, it's a creative choice of the author, the AI needs instructions to know what to do, so it would need constant handholding, on the other hand RT uses simple physics to calculate how light bounced and NN to apply the light on surfaces.",Neutral
Intel,But the destructable environment and the water graphics and other things in Direct X 9 made high end pcs kneel as well.  I remember playing on my 9800gtx/+ with my Intel Q9300 quad core (lapped and oc'ed to 3.0ghz - EDIT: checked some old evga posts got it to 3.33ghz) with 2x4gigs DDR2 @1000mhz cas 5 trying to maintain a sustained 30fps at 900p resolution on my 1680x1050 monitor. And I oc'ed the crap out of that 9800gtx 835 mhz (cant recall if it was unlinked shadder or not now) core on blower air (won the silicon lottery with that evga card).  Tweaking settings was mostly user done and guided with old school limited forum help. Ahh the good old days of having lots of time during school breaks.,Neutral
Intel,"The equivalent of a 4090 at the time, 8800 ultra (768MB) got 7.5 fps at 1920x1200 very high quality. The other cards were not able to run it. Even the lowest tier last generation card runs this, even though it's at 5% speed.",Neutral
Intel,No and no again lol  The 8800gtx could do 1152x864 high and that was the top dog. DX9 cards could do that at medium but high shaders was like a 25fps average tops and that dropped into the teens on the snow level.   It took things like the gtx480 and HD 6970 to do 1920x1080 30fps max settings. That's before getting into Sandy Bridge being the first cpu that could sustain 40+ fps if the gpu power was there.   Crysis came during the core 2 duo/k8 athlon and first wave dx10 cards era and it took *2 more generations* of *both* gpus and cpus to do it some justice.,Neutral
Intel,"My 8800ultra was getting single digit fps at 1080p ultra, so CP isn't quite as demanding.",Neutral
Intel,Amd had a tessellation unit. It went unused but it was present,Neutral
Intel,"My fun story for PhysX was Mirrors Edge. I don't remember what GPU I had at the time but the game was pretty new when I played it. Ran fine for quite some time until one scene where you get ambushed in a building by the cops and they shoot at the glass. The shattering glass with PhysX turned on absolutely TANKED my framerates, like single digit. I didn't realize that the PhysX toggle was turned on in the settings. This was at a time when PhysX required a dedicated PCIe card in your system.   Once I turned it off it ran fine. Now I can run that game at ridiculous framerates without my system getting warm.",Positive
Intel,"I remember around about 2008 when companies like Asus and Dell were selling ""Physics Processing Units"" and some claimed that these would be commonplace in gaming machines just like Graphics cards had become 10 years previously.",Neutral
Intel,"Hardware accelerated physics (as in on the gpu), is different than what's going on the CPU.",Neutral
Intel,Yeah. People with Windows 7 were using AMD to play the game with old Nvidia card for Physx. Nvidia didn't like that and blocked it via driver,Negative
Intel,"People used to have ATI/AMD for main and a lower-end NVIDIA for PhysX.  When NVIDIA found this out they pushed out drivers that disabled PhysX on their cards if an ATI/AMD card was detected, limiting you to the intentionally piss-poor CPU implementation of PhysX.  Think about that crap.  One day everything's going fine for consumers, the next day NVIDIA decides they don't like how consumers are legitimately using their cards and gimps everyone, weaponizing a physics engine company that they bought in 2008.",Negative
Intel,"Oh damn, I forgot about those cards.  I wanted one so badly.",Negative
Intel,Remember when companies tried to sell physics cards lol,Neutral
Intel,>PhysX  It never was a dedicated Nvidia card - it was a [dedicated psysx](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/bfg-ageia-physx-card/) on which the tech later was bought by Nvidia and implemented in it's own GPU's.  But the things never became really populair.,Neutral
Intel,"This makes me wonder if we'll ever see something similar with Raytracing, where we get a 2nd GPU purely for RT, and then the main GPU just does all the other stuff. Would that even be possible?",Neutral
Intel,I remember when people had a dedicated PhysX card.,Neutral
Intel,The ray/path tracing in this case done by specialized hardware which has more room to grow faster.,Neutral
Intel,"I would, transistor shrinking isn't the only method of increasing performance, and honestly, these companies have to keep putting out better cards to make money.  There have been many breakthroughs over the last few years. I give it another 5 as both amd and nvidia are pushing ai accelerated ray tracing on their cards, nvidia is in the lead for now but amd will eventually catch up.",Positive
Intel,There is still a big leap possible since all lithography processes at the moment are hybrid euv and duv.   But the moment everything is done euv things will drastically slow down.,Neutral
Intel,"No those are just pennies in the pocket of Nvidia, but as the consequence you as the customer need to take a mortgage on a brand new GPU.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah the next 10 years are gonna be spent getting budget cards up to 4090 level performance, rather than bringing the bleeding edge to 5-10x the 4090 performance. As long as 4K is king, there’s not much incentive to do the latter.",Negative
Intel,"In 10 years we will be begging one of several thousand test-tube created Musk Family members for $200 so we can buy a cheeseburger.  But the jokes on them, we’re just gonna spend it on space crack.",Negative
Intel,"Never. Even if performance can be pushed that far, by the time it happens there won't be such a thing as a $200 graphics card anymore.",Negative
Intel,It's not happening unless the market crashes and they start focusing on offering good price/performance cards instead of bumping up prices every generation.,Negative
Intel,25 years,Neutral
Intel,"The software needs to run on hardware, right now it eats through GPU compute and memory.",Neutral
Intel,And sadly ended up with 450 Watt TDP to achieve that performance.,Negative
Intel,This. We'd be lucky to see more than 3 generations in the upcoming decade.,Positive
Intel,"Having seen a few newer games on relatively low resolution CRT display, I can't help but think it might come down to improved display tech and embedded scaling. Like DLSS3 features in the display instead of the GPU.",Neutral
Intel,Not with that attitude,Negative
Intel,Love how it's still gimped on memory size 😂,Positive
Intel,"They just need to render the minimum information needed , and let the ai do the rest",Neutral
Intel,"Don't get upscaling, to me it looks shite. Why spend hundreds or thousands on a GPU to not even run at native resolution.   It's something Nvidia are pushing because they've got a better version of it at the moment.  Maybe it'll improve, it's pretty much snake oil currently imo.",Negative
Intel,"Feels pretty good with 120 frames. Playing with a controller, i don‘t mind or even feel the input lag on a projector screen.",Positive
Intel,"It's mad that even with a 4090 running games at 4k, they still look less realistic than the low-res FMV sequences in The 7th Guest from 30 years ago.",Negative
Intel,"Do keep in mind that despite both being named the same, the devil's in the details. Movies use way more rays per scene and way more bounces too.   Path tracing in CP2077 shows temporal artifacts due to denoising, something that doesn't happen in movies. It is being improved with the likes of DLSS 3.5, but it is still quite off when compared to said movies.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind the systems that rendered toy story 1, costing upwards of like 300k IIRC, have less power than your cell phone today and were super delicate/finicky machines. There's a dude on youtube that got a hold of like the second best one that was made at the time and the machine honestly was really impressive for when it came out, but it pales in comparison to even a steam deck really.",Neutral
Intel,"> Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story  Toy Story didn't use path tracing though, A Bug's Life was Pixar's first movie to use ray tracing (not path tracing) and only for a few frames in the entire movie for specific reflections, they started using ray tracing more generally for Cars and I can't find exactly when they started using path tracing but it should be around the early 2010s which is also when the other Disney animation studios started using path tracing",Neutral
Intel,No it's not a miracle. Because it's downscaled a lot and also uses lower quality math and piggybacking on AI to make up for it. It's basically running through 3 layers of cheats to produce results that aren't that much better than just traditional raster.,Negative
Intel,"That’d be some next level consumerism, paying 1500$ minimum to turn on a single setting in a single game just to play it wayyyyy slower than you would otherwise",Negative
Intel,"Hell playing path tracing with my 2080ti at 25 FPS is still looks absolutely fantastic, I would absolutely play with pathtracing on a 4090 constantly. Idc dlss looks great with RR even at 1080p. I won’t upgrade for another year or 2 (just bought a phone so I’m broke right now)",Positive
Intel,4090 getting 60fps at 4k balanced dlss with no frame gen. 100 with frame gen. I can make it drop into the 20s if I stand right next to a fire with all the smoke and lightening effects or if I go to a heavily vegetated area it’ll drop to mid 40s. But it’s stay consistently at 55-65 and even goes Into the 90s if I head out of the city.   Haven’t tried it at quality or with dlss off though. May go do that now that it says only 19fps lol. Have to try it to see for myself,Neutral
Intel,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-dlss-35-tested-ai-powered-graphics-leaves-competitors-behind  Well it's so close (54fps) it's more like a 3080Ti or higher from 3000 series or a 4070TI + from 4000 series it seems? The old 3000 series is punching way above it weight vs the 7900xtx, which was meant to deliver similar RT performance to the 3090.. which it doesn't.",Neutral
Intel,At some point the RT pixels are so expensive that native resolution w/o DLSS and frame gen is just not gonna work for the time being.,Negative
Intel,"On the other hand, if you set the new DLSS 3.5 to performance (which you should in 4k), and just enable frame generation, you get 90+ in 4k with basically zero issues unless you pause to check frames.",Positive
Intel,So rendering at 960p? Oof...,Neutral
Intel,"you take that back, I literally returned my 4080FE for a 4090 liquid x for more frames in cyberpunk.",Neutral
Intel,I almost see no difference.   And to see the little diffidence I need to take two screenshots and compare them.,Neutral
Intel,The game look is ruined on PT it makes everything look completely different.  Regular RT keeps the style of the game and performs good.,Positive
Intel,Dont use useless raytracing and you wont have any problems lol,Negative
Intel,"Because PC gaming blew up during a time where you could buy a mid range GPU and not need to upgrade for 5-6 years. Now those sample people buy a GPU, and 2 years later it can't run new games. At least that's my theory.",Negative
Intel,AW2 looks insane. Can't wait to play soon,Positive
Intel,Well the 3050 managed to hold with just 8GB while the 3070Yi crashed?,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, and people insisted on defending the configurations at launch lmao. The cards just won't be able to handle heavy loads at high resolution such as this game, regardless of how fucking insane the actual processing unit is.

Intel,DLSS unironically looks better than native TAA even at 1080p in this game because of the shit ghosting.,Negative
Intel,Only people who don't give a shit about high quality graphics don't care about ray tracing.,Negative
Intel,I got a stupidly good deal on the 4090(buddy won an extra one from a company raffle) and it just so happened my XTX was one of the cards suffering from the mounting issue on release.  Honestly very happy that all of that happened. Sure I would have been happy with the 7900xtx if I got a replacement but the 4090 just kinda blew me away especially with all the DLSS tech behind it.,Positive
Intel,"Nvidia used cp77 as a testing grounds for their dlss3 and rt tech, it'd no surprise it looks and performs relatively good, they literally partnered with cdpr for that.  Do not expect these levels of RT on most games anytime soon, probably in a couple years (with rtx 5000 series) the tech will be more mature and not as taxing for most cards, because needing to upscale and use framegen to get 60fps on an RT PT setting is kinda absurd.",Positive
Intel,">only then they become great features  Watch this happen with ""fake frames"" FSR3 in real time",Neutral
Intel,>Ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick   This line was already false years ago when control launched. Now it’s just absurd,Negative
Intel,"There are a lot of new games that features Ray Tracing on them as of now, too bad most of them doesn't look as visually as good as they could be though as most of the time their RT effects are dumbed down or reduced to the point it's pointless.  But the thing is that wasn't the point even from the beginning, RT Overdrive on Cyberpunk is literally considered as a Technological showcase  What matters here IMO for all of us is PC platform in general is showcasing here what a real high-end computers can achieve beyond what current gen console can do, and they are showcasing it really well here on Cyberpunk with much better visuals and using plenty of tricks to make them more than playable, where they shouldn't be considering how much demanding they are over standard, that is impressive enough to me and shows a good sign of technological engineering innovation.   As what Bryan Catanzaro said on his interview on DF Direct, work smarter not harder, brute force is not everything, of course it still matters a lot but doing it alone is starting to become pointless just like how it is on real life.",Negative
Intel,Much more fps :) Newer generation cards have at least 50-60% better raster performance then prev gen.,Positive
Intel,The Evangelical Church of Native,Neutral
Intel,"So just to be clear, you don't like running games at native resolution? Because the purpose of DLSS is to improve performance by specifically not running at native resolution",Negative
Intel,Nice but ive been playing video games since the 70s and its Shit end off..,Negative
Intel,The future of frame generation is going to be huge. I can definitely see 360p frame rendering upscaled to 4k with 80% maybe even 90% of the frames being generated. All with equal to or even better visual quality.   A 20 FPS game like this will become a 100-200fps game.  We may be looking at the end of beefy graphics cards being required to play games. Just a good enough mid or low tier chip (granted 5-10 years from now) with frame generation might be enough.,Positive
Intel,"After 2.0, it's around 100""fps"". Just 60""fps"" (meaning with FG enabled) is far from being playable due to latency. You need at least 90""fps"" for playable experience.   Cyberpunk PT vs RT is a huge difference in terms of graphics, while DLSS Quality vs Balanced is really slim in comparison. What you say would be a really bad trade-off.   At 1440p DLSS Quality it's easily 120+""fps"" which is perfectly comfortable.",Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is greatly optimized. It looks fantastic for the hardware it asks. Starfield looks like game from 5 years that asks hardware from the future.,Positive

Intel,"There literally is a /s, what else do you need to detect sarcasm?",Neutral
Intel,"Someone made a really cool comment yesterdays on Reddit that even a generated frame using path tracing is less fake than a rasterized frame. It is effectively closer to reference truth.

Intel,haha this is gold 🥇,Neutral
Intel,"At the moment, it’s definitely what it seems like.  Especially seeing how there’s only one card on the planet that can run this. Do you have a 4090?",Neutral
Intel,">I would still argue it's still in proof of concept stage.  Not at all, in fact another AAA game with ""path tracing"" is coming out next month.  >The tech will only become viable once the flagship GPU'S start getting 4k 60fps at native  Forget ""native"", that ship has already sailed. Nvidia, AMD and Intel are all working on machine learning techniques, and several game developers are starting to optimize their games around DLSS/FSR.",Neutral
Intel,"Nope, not even close.  Shaders 3.0 - that's improvement. Ray tracing is noticeable, but nowhere near to justify the hit.  I've looked techpowerup comparison RT vs LOW (lol). Low looked far better and cleaner, then blurry mess of RT (Overdrive).   I don't need ""realistic"" lighting, I need pleasent bisual part with good gameplay. For ghraphics I have a window in my appartment.",Neutral
Intel,"In a screenshot, sure. When actually playing the game, unless the fps is low enough to remind them, 99,99% of people will forget if they left it on or not.",Negative
Intel,Pixar movies will sometimes take the better part of a day to render a single 4k frame on a render farm. So the fact that Cyberpunk takes more than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame in its path-tracing mode on a single 4090 clearly means that it's unoptimized garbage! /s  EDIT: Apparently people in this thread don't understand sarcasm (or don't understand how a path-traced game can take longer than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame with high-poly path tracing and still be optimized).,Negative
Intel,Man you had to lap your q9300 to hit 3.0ghz? Those chips really weren't OC friendly.  My q6600 hummed along 3.2 no problem on 92mm arctic freezer and a slight voltage bump.  I was so pumped when I upgraded to a gtx 260. Crysis was a dream.,Positive
Intel,Funnily Crysis still have better destructible environments than Cyberpunk has tho,Positive
Intel,"This. People losing their shit either weren't around when Crysis launched or have forgotten just how demanding it was . PT CP kicks the shit out of a 4090, Crysis murdered my 8800ultra.",Negative
Intel,crysis did not do 1080p 60 on maximum setting and dx10 on a 8800GT.   I had a 1280*1024 monitor back then and barely had 30 fps with my 8800GT.   Even the 8800 Ultra did not do 60 fps on full hd.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=46j6fDkMq9I,Negative
Intel,"Man, I remember how hype the 8800gt was. Thing was a hell of a big jump compared to previous cards that came out, prolly our first REALLY powerful card.  Still remember the old xplay video where they build a PC to play crysis and Bioshock. Put 2 8800GTs in sli in there with a core 2 quad which costed one thousand dollars back then!",Positive
Intel,"My poor HD 4850 got pushed to the limit to give me 1280x1024, lol",Negative
Intel,I remember thinking $300-400 (IIRC) was so much for a GPU back around those days.  7800XT is the closest we've seen in a while and not even close to the top end for today.,Negative
Intel,This is still the case to this day because the game includes a really old DLL file for PhysX. The other day I followed the instructions on the PCGamingWiki to delete some DLL files in the game directory and only then it ran perfectly smooth on my RTX 3070.,Neutral
Intel,LOL I remember this exact scene also.,Neutral
Intel,"CPU PhysX back then was single-threaded and relied on ancient x87 instructions if I recall correctly, basically gimped on purpose. Even with a 5800X3D the shattering glass reduces the frame rate to the low teens. Sadly an Nvidia GPU is still required if you want to turn PhysX effects on for games from that era, though I hear that it's possible again to use it with an AMD GPU as primary.",Negative
Intel,"OMG I had the exact same experience, hahaha I remember it vividly, I was so confused why that room would just destroy my FPS until I figured out PhysX was enabled LOL",Negative
Intel,"I'd like to see ray tracing addon cards, seems logical to me.",Neutral
Intel,"TBH, I could probably run some of the old games I have on CPU without the GPU.",Neutral
Intel,Had the exact same experience. One scene in the whole game that actually used PhysX,Neutral
Intel,You could probably run Mirror's edge with physx on today's hardware without gpu fans turning on,Neutral
Intel,Last time I tried on an R7 1700X and RX580 I still couldn't turn on PhysiX without it being a stutter party 2 fps game.,Negative
Intel,What gpu you have,Neutral
Intel,Now it even runs fine on a Ryzen 2400G.,Positive
Intel,"And they were right, PhysX and systems very much like it are still used but things have advanced so much nobody even thinks about it and it no longer requires dedicated silicon.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, it’s been common knowledge for many years now that Nvidia are the most ruthlessly anti-consumer company in PC hardware, and it’s not particularly close.",Negative
Intel,Ah good old Ageia before nvidia bought them out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageia,Positive
Intel,"No, you could actually install two Nvidia cards and dedicate one of them to only PhysX.",Neutral
Intel,"It would certainly be possible, but it wouldn't really make sense. Splitting it up on multiple GPUs would have a lot of the same problems that sli/crossfire had. You would have to duplicate memory, effort, and increase latency when you composite the final image.  It may or may not make sense to maybe have a raster chiplet and a ray tracing chiplet on the same processor package on a single gpu. But, probably makes more sense to have it all on one chiplet, and just use many of the same chiplet for product segmentation purposes instead.   A separate PPU did make sense tho, I'm still annoyed that the nvidia ageia deal essentially kill the PPU in the cradle. Our gaming rigs would cost more if PPUs became a thing, but we could have had a lot better physics then we do today. There is still a revolution in physics to be had some day...",Negative
Intel,would be cool if 2000/3000 series users could get a small tensor core only PCIe card to upgrade to framegen,Positive
Intel,"That's true, but if he's talking about *the equivalent* of a current $200-class card, I'd say about it's 10 years, what do you think?",Neutral
Intel,At least with the 4090 you can run 70% power target and still hit insane FPS while only pulling around 300w which is the same as my old 3080. The gains with that extra 150w are a couple percent at best. Not worth it to me.,Negative
Intel,Intel design will be a little bit different as far as now.  If I understood it right AMD chiplets communicate via lines on pcb but Intel wants to make something like chip-on-a-chip.,Neutral
Intel,bedroom ring library cows summer thought aspiring worm north joke   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*,Neutral
Intel,"It's also worth noting that those early movies don't use path tracing either, Pixar switched to PT with Monster University around 2013 IIRC.",Negative
Intel,"There is a lot of room for improvement, both in the software and future generations of hardware.  It's coming along though!  Overdrive mode looks nice, but there's just a lot more ghosting than the regular RT mode.",Positive
Intel,"They are still the same thing and should be named the same, your disclaimer is just semantics about the implementation.",Neutral
Intel,"Weird argument.  Traditional raster is cheats upon cheats upon cheats already.  In fact, all of the lighting entirely in raster is essentially cheats.",Negative
Intel,It will not work well/look good using a single frame worth of data either due to the low ray counts. Digital Foundry has shown Metro Exodus builds the lighting over ~20 frames or so and it seems like Cyberpunk is even more. Even Cyberpunk ray pathtracing doesn't look as good in motion due to that same build-up effect.  You need to cast 20-50x the rays to have enough data for a single frame but then you will be measuring the game performance by seconds per frame.,Negative
Intel,"RT looks significantly better than raster when it’s not just using simple reflections like a Far Cry 6. Raster is all cheats, the so called reflections are essentially rendering the scene or part of the scene being reflected in reverse then applying fake material effects to mimic metal, water, etc. Raster also takes HUNDREDS to thousands of person hours to get the fake reflections and lighting to look decent to good. That’s why devs love RT and want it to grow, as RT/hardware does the work for them.",Negative
Intel,It's significantly better than raster. It kills fps but the quality is great,Positive
Intel,Better graphics needing more expensive hardware is hardly a hot take.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, better graphics costs performance. SHOCKING",Positive
Intel,People do it!,Neutral
Intel,It’s not way slower. I get 110 FPS at 4k with all DLSS settings turned on and honestly it’s insane.,Positive
Intel,"I shamefully admit I bought a (inflation adjusted) $400 console in the past to play one game. That's marginally better than buying a GPU for one setting in one game, but still.",Positive
Intel,Sounds like most nvidia fanboys,Neutral
Intel,"If you're into the eye candy, I can see a lot of people that have the money doing it.  Not everyone though. That's around a mortgage payment for me.",Neutral
Intel,And yet people will tell you how nvidia is mandatory. Like you want to overspend to play 1 game with shitty fps? I don't understand these people.,Negative
Intel,Nvidia fanboys being happy with fake frames and fake resolution will never not be funny to me.,Negative
Intel,What? I thought amd was always more tuned to raster as opposed to reflections,Neutral
Intel,Which is why nvidia is rabidly chasing AI hacks,Negative
Intel,This and rumors are saying that the 5090 is gonna be 50-70% faster than 4090 which wont be enough for native 4k either.,Negative
Intel,Say that to the people playing upscaled games at 4k (540p) on PS5.,Neutral
Intel,"I understand some RT effects might not catch everyones eyes, but seriously, path tracing cyberpunk vs 0 RT cyberpunk IS a big difference",Neutral
Intel,Huh? [Watch this is in 4K on a big screen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7_eHxfBsHQ&lc=UgyO2vRiSI6CRU5kYmV4AaABAg.9uyI5P8oamz9uylTN_rdmL) The differences are really apparent in each version.,Neutral
Intel,"PT looks way better in the game to me - it makes everything in the environment have a more natural look to it.  It adds, not ruins it...",Positive
Intel,"That's how I feel as well. It looks awesome don't get me wrong, but it doesn't look like cyberpunk to me.",Negative
Intel,It's not a perfect way of measure but you can clearly see how (at least on Nvidia GPUs) the 8/10GB cards are way behind the >11Gb cards. Meaning you need 11 or 12GB of VRAM for this scenario which cripples the 3080 but not the 3060.  We said from the start these configurations are shit but no-one listened. There you go.,Negative
Intel,The crypto miners did me a comical solid by preventing me from acquiring many countless times and hours I wasted (came from a gtx1070 before finally being able to upgrade). Was able to get my 6900xt eventually for around $600 with 2 games. Becoming increasing thankful for the extra Vram these days.   Once I start getting through my game backlog and into the gard hitting ray tracing ones will hopefully upgrade to something with at least 24gigs of GDDR# lol.,Positive
Intel,"I mean, Alan Wake 2 is also releasing with path tracing so my guess is we're definitely gonna see more games featuring heavier RT, although not necessarily path tracing due to the performance hit.",Negative
Intel,"I expect path tracing support to be the exception for a while because most developers will consider the non-trivial dev time to implement it not worth it. However, I'm sure Nvidia would be willing to throw dev help at most developers who would be willing to implement path tracing with their help.  Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090). That's substantially faster than than how fast a 4090 runs Cyberpunk on the path tracing mode. Presumably, a less complex world helps, but they may also have implemented opacity micro maps, which I'm not sure if Cyberpunk has done in the 2.0 update. Perhaps they're cherry-picked examples for the trailer.",Neutral
Intel,Raytracing now is a gimmick *  ( * - in AMD sponsored games where RT effects are so tiny you have to zoom on to notice them),Negative
Intel,"Except this is a tech demo. CP77 has lots of cut corners to achieve that, NN was trained to keep the interface stable in that game and even then, ray reconstruction creates horrible artifacts at some angles and distances. And that's with Ngreedia's engineeers literally sitting at CDPR's office.",Negative
Intel,You can already have 120fps on $1000 PC,Neutral
Intel,It improves both looks and fps so it is a win win,Positive
Intel,"The issue with this is the inputs will only be registered at 20Hz. This would feel awful. The benefit of high FPS is having very low latency. This will just make it look smoother, not feel any better than 20 FPS",Negative
Intel,Considering there is no input on the generated frames that is going to feel horrible to play. Base FPS (incl DLSS) really still needs to be 50-60fps to feel playable imo.,Negative
Intel,I'm thinking will there ever come a day where 100% of frames are generated by AI. Like the data inputs directly from the card into the neural network and it no longer requires physical hardware limitation to generate frames.,Neutral
Intel,"Don't forget that all NPCs will be controled by AI to simulate a real life.  They'll wake up in the morning, shower, commute to work, work, then go home.  All this to do it over and over and over until they die...  mhhh... this is kinda sad to type out.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)",Negative
Intel,It absolutely is. I’ve been playing at 1440p with DLSS Balanced and Ray Reconstruction and it is absolutely the worst version of DLSS I’ve ever seen. It’s basically unusable.,Negative
Intel,There are horrible artifacts with RR. And ghosting. It replaces artifacts with different ones. Needs a lot more work tbh. Or training.,Neutral
Intel,"The thing about ray and path tracing is that they are demanding on their own, not because they are badly optimised",Negative
Intel,"I have a 4070. It runs the game just fine with the tools that have been set in place.  This is absolutely not a pissing match. Cyberpunk is demanding, and takes advantage of lots of tech available for upscaling and ray tracing and frame generation. AMD card’s currently do not match Nvidia’s in those categories, not even close. This us not an attempt to showcase Nvidia tech, but it does take advantage of it.",Positive
Intel,Because it's not about the flagship card. Only if the flagship can attain good performance at native then you will have headroom for lower end cards. Think about it. Of course upscaling is very important. But you also need some headroom to upscale.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah. I wanted better cooling performance after upgrading to the artic freezer 7 as well with those weird crapy plastic tension clips you pushed in manually, fearing bending them (worse than the stock intel cooler tension twist lock). Kept having random stability crashes until after i sanded it down for better thermals...Good old sandpaper and nerves of steel fearing an uneven removal of the nickel coating.  Was trying to maximize performance as back then core 2 duo and the extreme versions were king and they had way higher single core clocks and were easy to oc. Wanted the multhreaded for Crysis, LoL (back when you had to wait 5min+ to get into a game), BF2, and was eventually playing TF, Day of Defeat and Natural Selection.  My upgrade back then was to the Evga 560ti DS, which I ended up installing a backplate and  a gelid cooler. They had wayy better thermal tape/individual heatsinks for the memory/vram chips for the heat transfer. Evga back then told me if I ever needed to RMA it that I would just need to re-assemble it as it was shipped. Remember using artic solver ceramique instead of as5 due to it potentially not degrading as fast as well.   Good times =)",Negative
Intel,"Yea same here, didn't play crysis until I got a hold of a 260 after having 2 8600gt's in sli. Played mostly wow at the time and those 2 8600gt's in sli got blown away by the gtx 260, but man that card was hot!  Remember in 2011 upgrading to a gtx 570, the first gen with tessellation and playing dragon age 2 which was one of the first games to have it. Ended up turning off tessellation cause it hit the card too hard, least until I got a second 570 in sli, which sadly died like a year later due to heat while playing Shadow Warrior.",Positive
Intel,Q6600 was the bomb. I ran mine at 3.0GHz all its life and it's still alive today. Had it paired with an 8800GT which was IMO one of the best GPU value/performance of all time.,Positive
Intel,Had 3.4ghz on my q6600 didnt want to hit 3.6ghz on modest voltage but 3.4 all day and was quite the lift in fps in gta4 compared to stock 2.4ghz. Run 60fps 1440x900 no problem those where the days when OC gave actual performance boost,Neutral
Intel,> I was so pumped when I upgraded to a gtx 260. Crysis was a dream.  In those days I was a broke teenager and I remember upgrading to a GTS250(rebadged 9800GTX+ with more vram) and crysis still hammered my Athlon x4 965(?) system.  While my richer neighborhood buddy upgraded to a 260 just to play Left 4 dead.,Positive
Intel,"> q9300  Yes, it was not a good bin. I was at 4.0GHz with my Q9550, with just a copious amount of voltage.",Neutral
Intel,"After checking sone old Evga posts, (mod rigs server is done, along with old signatures), I was able to get to 3.33ghz.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah my lapped Q6600 was my daily driver at 3.2 GHz with a Tuniq Tower 120 Extreme. It ran it pretty cool. I think when Crysis came out it and my 8800 GTX could do 20-25 frames at 1680x1050 with drops into the teens. EVGA replaced it with a GTX 460 when it died, big upgrade.",Positive

Intel,"I wonder the same thing. But I guess if Nvidia would put it all in an extra card, people would just buy more amd to get the best of both worlds.",Neutral
Intel,Game physics doesn't seem to be a focus anymore though,Neutral
Intel,I'm ashamed I even own one NVIDIA card.    Unsurprisingly it's in a laptop that I bought during the [illegal GeForce Partner Program](https://hothardware.com/news/nvidia-geforce-partner-program) before the public knew about the program.  Not making that mistake again.  Screw NVIDIA.  Every other card I've ever gotten has been ATI/AMD (and obviously the low-end integrated Intel GPUs on some office laptops)  EDIT: Keep them downvotes coming.  You've all been bullshitted by NVIDIA's marketing.  Your boos mean nothing; I've seen what makes you cheer.,Negative
Intel,Anyone who owns an Nvidia GPU should be ashamed of themselves tbh.,Negative
Intel,"There was more nuance to that ""bugfix"" than just ""it was a bug that got fixed""   Modders were able to re-enable the AMD/NVIDIA PhysX combo basically immediately via editing DLLs.  Not driver replacements, but actual DLL tweaks.  The speed at which modders were able to fix what NVIDIA ""broke"" combined with the public outrage put them in a funny legal spot.  If they continued with PhysX disabled and claiming it was a bug then the bug can easily be fixed, as shown by modders doing it first.  So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.  Obviously not many modern games use the GPU implementation of PhysX anymore and the performance difference between current GPU and CPU implementations are negligible anyway, but their intent at the time was clear once it was shown how quickly modders were able to get everyone back to normal.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, but not after Nvidia bought Ageia.",Neutral
Intel,"If the $200 cards of today aren't 3x better than the flagship cards of 10 years ago (they're not), then you shouldn't expect a $200 card in 2033 to be 3x faster than an RTX 4090. Average annual performance gains are more likely to decrease between now and then, rather than increase.",Negative
Intel,I like how you said: static image  because in motion upscaling is crappier,Neutral
Intel,"It isn't a weird argument. Rasterization is premised on approximating reality, while RT is simulating it.  The extreme few amount of rays we trace right now, including bounces, means effects are often muted and the performance hit is enormous. To compensate, we're using temporal upscaling from super low resolutions *and* frame interpolation.  Temporal upscaling isn't without it's issues, and you know how much traditional denoisers leave to be desired. Even Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction leaves a lot to be desired; the thread on r/Nvidia shows as much, with ghosting, artifacts, etc. all over again. It's like the launch of DLSS 2.0.  All of that, for effects that are oftentimes difficult to perceive, and for utterly devastating traditional rasterization performance.",Negative
Intel,"It's a shame raster is so labor intensive, because it looks so interesting when done right.     I look at screenshots from cyberpunk, Raster / Ray Trace / Path Trace, and in most of them the raster just looks more interesting to me. Not constrained by what would be real physical lighting. The 100% RT render versions of old games like Quake gives a similar feeling.     But I imagine there will be more stylistic RT lighting over time, it saving a ton of labor is all things considered good, freeing it up for actual game design.",Positive
Intel,">That’s why devs love RT and want it to grow, as RT/hardware does the work for them.  It's the marketing departments that love RT. Devs hate it because it's just yet more work on top of the existing raster work.",Positive
Intel,"It *is* way slower, you're just compensating it by reducing render resolution a ton",Negative

Intel,If it works it works....computer graphics has always been about approximation,Positive
Intel,"4090 is \~66% more powerful than 3090 overall, but it has 112% more fps in this test.     The RT capabilities of NVIDIA cards has grown faster than general capabilities.",Positive
Intel,"I guess on the internet, you can just lie. There’s no game on ps5 that upscale from 540p to 4k.",Negative

Intel,It's big in certain lighting situations. In others it's not as noticeable as you'd hope,Neutral
Intel,"PT vs no RT comp is silly.  U should compare PT vs RT, and there, the difference is minor and not even subjectively better. Just different.",Negative
Intel,Natural? It over saturates the light bleeding into the entire scene. Everything becomes so colorful. Even when floors or ceilings are not supposed to be reflective. Literally tiles with grainy texture suddenly becomes a mirror..  It's ridiculously overdone.,Negative
Intel,Guys I'm trying to suffer while I play the game what settings will let me suffer the most,Negative
Intel,"I mean this is native RT/TAA. Was never meant to be played this way. You need to use DLSS and Ray Reconstruction. With that setting, i get about 40-50fps at max settings with my 3080. Not too bad.  The thing about AMD is that they don't have any of this AI technology (yet). You have to rely on raw power, which won't get you far.",Neutral
Intel,"Until the next generation of consoles, I think path tracing will be added to something like a couple major games per year with Nvidia's help. If I'm right, that's wouldn't be a lot, but it's definitely be a bonus for those who have GPUs that are better at ray tracing.  Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090). That's substantially faster than than how fast a 4090 runs Cyberpunk on the path tracing mode (which could be for a variety of reasons, including CP2077's larger world).",Positive
Intel,Alan Wake 2 is also an outlier since the same dev made Control which was a test bed for DLSS 2.0 and one of the earliest games to fully embrace ray tracing. Alan Wake 2 is also NVIDIA sponsored and looking to be another test bed for them.,Neutral
Intel,"Redditors trying to have reading comprehension (impossible)     >It's not about being a fanboy of amd, but ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick, not because it's unnoticeable or bad, just because it's not ""popular"" (I myself really like it).",Negative

Intel,Get that fps with a 5120*1440 240Hz monitor,Neutral
Intel,"It's almost like crushing your fps with all these fancy new graphic features isn't worth it, even on the best cards. It's user preference in the end.  That said, many gamers, once they play at high hz screen and fps, find it very difficult to go back to low fps for any reason. Games feel slow by comparison, no matter how great the lighting looks.",Negative
Intel,"Both DLSS and FSR have weird image artifacts (FSR is worse though) so i guess if you don't see them then DLSS only works in your favor then.  I personally want as little noticeable image artifacts from DLSS/FSR when I play so opt for native resolution, generally.",Negative
Intel,Have you tried dlss quality. Dlss balanced sacrifices image quality and dlss quality doesn't/can enhance it sometimes,Neutral
Intel,">a lot of the comparisons just make it look like it gives too much bloom  This is due to colors being compressed to SDR. In HDR that ""bloom"" looks awesome as it's super bright like it would be in real life but still not losing any details. You lose those details only on those SDR videos.  PT just looks and feels way more natural than just RT, when only raster literally looks like it was two different games from two different hardware generations.  Once I saw Cyperpunk PT there is no way I'd imagine playing this game in any other way. All other games look absurdly ugly next to it now. It's something like when you get a high refresh screen and can't look back at 60Hz anymore.",Negative
Intel,"Trust me, I know how the technology works. That doesn't change the fact that it's not worth it imo. I'm not  paying 4090 money to have the newest fad that just makes games look over saturated and glossy.",Negative
Intel,We are talking about running the game just fine now are we? Because rasterization is just fine. I will consider ray tracing reasonable when you can do it maxed out for $1200(GPU) native. Until then it’s a gimmick. IMO,Positive

Intel,"That is because destructible buildings and realistic lighting REALLY does not go hand in hand. Realistic looking games use a ton of ""pre-baked"" light/shadow, that might change when ray tracing is the norm but it has a delay so things still look weird.",Negative
Intel,"I remember playing Crysis, flipped a wheeled garbage bin into a hut, which came down on top of it. I blew the wreckage up with grenades and the bin flew out, landing on it's side.

Intel,Cause regular stuff is so easy to simulate or fake simulate that super realistic complex items are not really worth the trouble.  &#x200B;  water still looks like crap in most games and requires a lot of work to make it right.  and even more processing power to make it truly realistic.  Cyberpunk is perfect example.  the water physics is atrocious.,Negative
Intel,It's because it's not the big selling point now and as the comment you're responding to... Things have gone so far no one really thinks about it anymore. Ray tracing is what physx used to be or even normal map and dx9/10 features you don't consider now.,Negative

Intel,Control also has some of the best implementations of RT I've ever seen. It's one of the very few games I've turned on RT and felt like it was worth the performance hit. Everything else I've played has looked very good with RT on but not good enough to be worth the performance hit.,Positive

Intel,"This just absurd and frankly entitled. Not everyone can afford a PC strong enough to run the most demanding games absolutely maxed out.   I never could, couldn’t even afford a PC until this past summer.   This obsession with performance metrics is ridiculous. Like, less than 5% of PC gamers even have 4k monitors. Almost 70% still have 1080p.   CDPR made a VERY demanding game that looks GORGEOUS completely turned up. Modern hardware cannot handle it natively, it can’t. It is not a gimmick that a company has developed a superior technology that allows the game to be played at almost the same quality as native, significantly smoother and faster. You’re in denial if you think otherwise.  I’m not tied to either brand. I have an AMD CPU bc it was the best option for what I wanted, and a Nvidia GPU for the same reason. I care about RT, frame gen, all of that. The Witcher 3 still is my favorite game, and the entire reasoning for building a gaming PC over a console is graphical quality and speed while doing so. That game is absolutely gorgeous with RT on. Same with Cyberpunk, which I can enjoy thanks to DLSS.   You don’t care about those things? That’s fine, but it is solely a personal opinion.",Negative
Intel,"Yea well I was defining an arbitrary performance. It's not about having native performance. But, but if a flagship is able to get 4k 60 with path tracing at native then that allows headroom for 60 tier or 70 tier cards to perform well.  In this example the 4090 gets 19.5 fps at 4k. The 4060ti gets 6.6 fps. Let's assume a next gen flagship is able to reach 60 fps at 4k. That would theoratically allow the 60ti card to reach around 20 fps. Once you do your various upscaling and frame generation techniques you can then reach 60 fps ideally with a mid range card.",Neutral

It's not conclusive, but I'm not going to rely on any company's PR statements to sway me one way or another because they will (obviously) say whatever they're able to prevent lawsuits and public image damage.

Intel,"Yeah, I can't really blame people for not recognizing great design if they are not interested in it. I don't think most people are interested in design, even though we all benefit from it without knowing it.     People might get some sort of subtle feeling when they see some great craft made by a experienced professional, but they can't really put it into words or evaluate the quality of the design without experience. They likely can't tell what cause the feeling to begin with even if they can notice it.     But everyone can instantly judge how real something looks, which is the go-to standard for ""good"". And bigger numbers are better, even if they are fake. Niche features that nobody uses also sells, as long as it's a new feature with a captivating name.     This reminded me.

Intel,"A lot of raster techniques reduce the complexity of lighting into very naive heuristics. Like shadow mapping renders the scene from the light's pov to create a depth map, then the objects that are at a greater depth have darker colors drawn (I'm simplifying that but roughly how it works). It's like teaching a kid how to illustrate shadows on an ball vs the how light actually works. Raster techniques have evolved a lot since then, and use raytracing in limited contexts, screen space reflections and ambient occlusion for example, but they're still operating with extremely limited data in narrow, isolated use cases, which is why they often look awful. There's just not enough information for them to look correct, just enough to trick you when you're not really paying attention.",Negative

There are differences, but saying ""every lit scene looks completely different"" with PT Vs regular RT is false.",Negative
Intel,"I'm not talking about DLSS 3.5. I'm talking about PT vs regular RT in CP2077. The visual difference is subjective, it looks different, is it better?

[Digital Foundry's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhAtN_rRuQo) is again the yardstick for how many small things they point out where RR improves the situation, even if it has some things where it fails atm. But maybe DLSS 3.6 will solve those.  I do feel DLSS itself has also improved in the past few years in terms of ghosting and performing at lower resolutions.  On a 1440p monitor these are the starting point resolutions:  - Quality: 1707x960p - Balance: 1485x835p - Performance: 1280x720p - Ultra Perf: 853x480p  So even the highest quality option is sub-1080p.

Intel,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",Neutral

Intel,"There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.

Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  AMD fails hard on 2 of those things.  Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.",Positive
Intel,"Yep, XeSS is just great, I happily use it in MWII on my Arc A770. But I still use DLSS on NVIDIA. But both are better than FSR.",Positive
Intel,"Then you should be looking at ***GPU*** usage, because CPU usage will not help you answer any of those questions",Negative
Intel,"Problem is, by itself it still tells you little to nothing. If GPU utilization drops like a brick you know something is bottlenecking. If CPU utilization changes in the absence of other data you know absolutely nothing of value.   The real kicker is the CPU utilization may not even be ""wrong"", it may just be polling at a very low rate because that's the other thing with these OSDs if you poll too frequently for up-to-date data that can kill performance from the overhead.",Negative
Intel,"> There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  Yep, tools like [this one from NVIDIA](https://youtu.be/-IK3gVeFP4s?t=51) have made it easier than ever as a dev to optimise for NVIDIA hardware.  > AMD fails hard on 2 of those things. Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.  Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts. Arc is just getting started, give Intel 5-10 years of time in GPU and they will outpace AMD for sure.",Positive
Intel,"There are many settings that directly impact CPU usage, so of course CPU utilization reading can be useful.  Not everything needs to be precisely accurate, this is a lousy defense. Getting 0% reads all the time is entirely worthless but some accurate reads is still useful information.",Neutral
Intel,"You are going out of your way to defend a broken feature.    7800X3D shows up as 1% CPU utilization during games such as Watch Dogs, Stellaris, Age of Empires. Clearly broken. Undefendable.",Negative
Intel,"And with a bit of luck, they will also hit AMD in the console market.  Right now AMD stays afloat GPU speaking because consoles, they were during a lot of years the only vendor offering both CPU and GPU in a single package, reducing costs A LOT.  Nvidia was not able to compete against that with the lack of CPUs and Intel with the lack of GPUs.  Now that Intel is working on dedicated GPUs they are going to eventually create APU like products, its just the natural outcome of producing both CPUs and GPUs.  And then AMD will NEED to compete against them instead of being the only option.  And if that happens, unless FSR gets turned into a hardware specific tech like XeSS that falls into different techs depending on the GPU its running on, AMD will be murdered.  Better software stack, better general hardware to accelerate and improve upscalling keeping costs down AND being a second player pushing prices down towards Sony and Microsoft?  AMD will be screwed up if they don't up their game. And hard.",Neutral
Intel,"Right, so what kind of useful information can you tell me if I raise graphics settings and CPU utilization goes from 12-16% to 16-17% while framerate goes down from 120 fps to 110 fps?",Neutral
Intel,"All CPU utilization tells anyone is thread scheduling, and nothing about what the threads are or aren't doing. Like the only situation that it marginally tells someone anything is how many threads a program uses. But that usually doesn't fluctuate with games, games usually scale up to <x> number of threads and that is that. GPU utilization is the one that is far more useful for spotting bottlenecks, general performance observations are far more useful for tweaking.  Even Intel and co. will tell you that with modern processors and all the elements they contain as well as hyperthreading/SMT CPU utilization isn't a very useful stat anymore. Meant a whole lot more when CPUs were one core unit and didn't also include the FPU and memory controller and everything else.",Neutral
Intel,"Cause unfortunately even if it wasn't broken, it's not useful in any meaningful capacity. Should it be broken? No. Would anything notable come of it if it were fixed? Also no. Given the bugs they got and room for improvement elsewhere it's one of those things that should be super low on the priority list or just removed wholesale.",Negative
Intel,"That whatever setting you are changing does not have much of an impact on CPU utilization, and if your GPU allows, you can use it.  What is the purpose of this question, are you really not aware of any settings that impact CPU usage? Some RT settings have big impacts on CPU usage too.",Neutral
Intel,"The problem you're missing here is that settings that are CPU demanding generally don't have an easily observable impact on CPU usage, if they have any impact at all.  The reliable way to see if a setting is CPU demanding is to turn it up, see the frame rate go down, and then look at how **GPU** usage changed.",Neutral
Intel,"I'm aware that some settingd impact CPU usage, but I think looking at the CPU usage is about as useful as your daily horoscope, or AIDA64 memory benchmark",Neutral

Intel,3050ti?  Gaming rip?  No,Neutral
Intel,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",Neutral

Intel,"possibly. Honestly weird as hell to not through in intel cpu results with the same gpus so they can see if it's a all cpu overhead issue, or an issue with amd cpus with intel gpu. Like even one game if intel/amd gave about the same performance you could likely rule it out somewhat.  Also weird to say they fixed it if by the sounds of it to say it's fixed if a very limited number of games were updated to work better in also seemingly limited scenarios. That's more like finding a specific problem on a specific game they were able to improve rather than an underlying fix which if implemented should help everywhere.",Negative

Intel,Would not have mattered. the cpu bottleneck in the intel driver is single-thread limited and largely due to draw-calls being stored in system memory as a buffer for the frametime render.

Intel,"> I mean the price had skyrocketed as well  This is actually not true. As someone who wanted to buy a b580 for a rly long time but only for msrp, the card took like almost 9 months to hit msrp. I was watching it for a while and I did not feel like paying above msrp for it. Like until a few weeks ago all the ones available were like 50+ dollars over msrp. Now you can actually buy one for msrp at multiple places which is a good thing.   > How much of the problem would you say has been solved since release  The overhead problem hasn't been solved. I don't even think intel can fix it or has any interest in fixing it as they knew about it since december of last year and nothing has come out to try fix it. How big a problem is really dependant on what games you wanna play. It can only be like a 5% overhead issue which still puts it faster than the 4060 and 7600 but theres some games where it's like 20% or more where you have to have a very strong cpu to not see the overhead.  Do some research on the games you play and that will tell u whether to buy a b580 or a 9060 xt. I ended up going with a 9060 xt even though I would have preferred a b580 just cause amd was able to supply msrp copies around launch and i didn't feel like waiting any longer.",Negative

Currently, for slot powered, the options are slim:  * Geforce RTX 3050 has solid performance at 70w... but only 6 or 8GB of RAM. * Radeon RX 6400 at 53w is a little beefier than a Steam Deck, but not much. * Radeon RX 7400 just came out, is 53w, and is better still - but still limited to 8GB of RAM and appears to be OEM-only. * Alchemist A310 at 75w and 4GB is a joke. * Alchemist A380 at 75w and 6GB isn't amazing, and trades blows with the RX 6400.  An Arc B50 Pro ticks a lot of boxes. 70w means slot powered and not even pushing to the very limit. 16GB of RAM means you won't have massive framebuffer limits.

The prebuilt eGPUs with a 7600 XT are decent. Only 8GB RAM, but the 7600XT easily beats the B50 Pro and 3050 at GB6 with scores of 83093 and 99525. But... it's $550-$600 for these. They aren't upgradable. And that 8GB of RAM is rough.  And sure, the Ryzen AI 395 with the Radeon 8060S is really solid... but Mini PCs with that are at least $1000, and that's getting a whole new machine. Thunderbolt 3+/USB4 ports are now quite common.

Same laws that intel has been consistently losing for decades?  >cheaper for AMD to pay from their own pocket to keep Intel afloat rather than let them go bankrupt.  That's not how anti trust/monopoly laws works. Company A going bankrupt because they kept shooting themselves in the foot doesn't mean that Company B automatically become subject to anti trust lawsuits. Nvidia isn't exactly paying AMD even when they hold 90-95% of the market. Legislative scrutiny tends to come from manipulative practices, not from just selling a better product.

AMD,"I was always surprised the media didn't spend more time discussing some of the crazy launch era voltage defaults all the vendors were using. Granted with Gigabyte frying chips and ASUS frying chips plus their own motherboards honorably committing seppuku for the chipacide afterwards, there was a lot going on.  I built a system a month after AM5 launched with a 7700X and ASRock B650E Riptide Wifi motherboard. Out of the gate VSOC defaulted to 1.25v but was reported at 1.288v by ZenTimings 1.29. VDD Misc was 1.3v, and CLDO was 1.10. Currently VDD Misc defaults to 1.1v, CLDO defaults to 0.95v even when setting 6000 1:1, and now VSOC shows as red if set above even 1.23v. VSOC also now actually delivers the voltage it's set to without running above it, so either ZenTimings changed how it measures or ASRock changed its LLC setting for the VSOC rail.  Will have to finish the video later but I do wonder if Steve is factoring in the ever-mercurial voltage defaults all the vendors were using. I know ASRock personally changed and tweaked every single voltage knob & paired LLC knob that existed and was constantly changing them for the first year, and still tweaking them by year two to try and lock down the memory headaches users were having. But some of those default voltages were still nuts even when the X3D chips first launched. So if users did update UEFI versions religiously I could easily see any initial damage caused before the UEFI was updated weakening the chip, thereby triggering a belated failure later despite now running on safer voltages.",Neutral

AMD,"Could this be caused by manufacturing tolerances in the physical layout of the pins and pads? Even a slight misalignment or height difference? For example, even if the board they tested already killed a CPU, maybe their new CPU has slightly tighter tolerances where it makes good contact with the pins on the board. As in, there is a minimum range of tolerances on both the CPU and the ASROCK board...and both need to hit that threshold before an issue arises. And maybe ASROCK board has looser tolerances than the other manufacturers leading to more failures on their boards.",Neutral

AMD,"People were saying it also affected the 7800X3D when this mess all began... but maybe they were wrong I honestly haven't looked deeply into this to know. That being said I do know some of the voltages were remained high even after the 9000-series launched. Was literally only few a months ago when ASRock changed the UEFI to redline a VSOC setting above 1.23v, before then it was happy to set 1.25v with EXPO. Was only after trouble began this year did ASRock finally start getting conservative with its voltage settings, but the 9800X3D debuted last Nov.  Did finish the video. When Steve mentioned most of the data points were people using 1.4v kits of memory that itself seems like a flag given the warnings I've read about exceeding 1.35v, but it's also the first time I've heard it mentioned as a possible factor. Back from the 7800X3D era I remember a Buildzoid video that mentions one of the three RAM voltages that gets changed by EXPO presets will affect power plane levels within part of the IO die, and there's one voltage plane that shouldn't get too high relative to another lest it cause problems. So having that set at 1.4 seems kind of bad for multiple reasons.",Neutral

AMD,"Yeah, I find PP to be generally lower and the fact that most people that share their benchmarks are doing so at lower context. That said, like I wrote on my own comment, it's difficult to generally find someone or an outlet benchmark and compare across HW. Then you'll get people who champion M4 Max or Ultra for their bandwidth while TG or compute is bottlenecked with longer context or the large model that their fitting in *unified memory*.

AMD,Source coming from a reddit post (that has a link to the BIOS):  [https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1nlpqx3/flashed\_the\_reaper\_9070\_into\_a\_fake\_xt\_boosted\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1nlpqx3/flashed_the_reaper_9070_into_a_fake_xt_boosted_my/)  Keep in mind in terms of power scaling the 9070 is more or less perfect at \~220W while the 9070 XT at \~300W. I think this BIOS is useful for getting the base 9070 near \~300W at max as Adrenalin at most gives you +10% PL so if you have a 9070 with a stock BIOS TBP at \~220W you can only go at most \~240W.,Neutral

AMD,Not like the old days where we could unlock cores and pipelines. :(  Just power limit increases.,Neutral
AMD,Dumb question but has anyone done the reverse?  Edit: nvm i guess its easier to undervolt LMAO,Neutral
AMD,Im interested in getting the 9070 for a fair price only because it is among the most efficient cards. Its cool increased power limit enables slight overclocking but there is nothing new or interesting in this.,Positive

AMD,Assuming a 12% uniform uplift. That puts it like 8% behind a 5080 which goes up to 380watts. So they are the same.     You can power limit a 5080 to like 200watts.... Meh i give up explaining since i dont care. Essentially in about a third of modern titles it would match a stock 9070.    I have to wonder what if they had overclocked gddr7. Might match a stock 5080,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah it isn't really worth doing unless the price differential is massive. I bought mine the first day that they came out, but my local Microcenter ran out of the MSRP XTs, so that's why I opted for the MSRP 9070. Pricing hasn't come down on those since the initial launch, so I just ended up keeping mine.",Negative

AMD,"Nah all it does is unlocking power limit. You could had do this with the 470/480 to a 580, vega 56 to 64, 5700 to xt.   This does not unlock more CUs, all it does is raise the artificially imposed power limit that AMD likes to put on their lower end models using the same die.   And gains are usually pretty decent, because AMD actually heavily power limits lower end models as a form of upselling their higher end cards using the same die, otherwise they are literally the same cards with a -5% CU and in some cases; cards with same CU but lower power limit.  If they added other form of segmentation like how nvidia did with the 5070ti and 5080 in the form of large cache cuts AMD wont need to power limit their non xt models heavily every generation.",Neutral

AMD,"I would guess that everybody should do that, undervolt and light overclock, full overclock on RAM.",Neutral
AMD,Unlike the 12v High Power connector the PCIe 6+2 has a more adequate safety factor. The similar EPS 12v can safely handle 300w with its four 12v pins. The 6+2 with three identical 12v pins could handle 225w without issue.  The bigger concern would the cards VRM. Manufacturers will often remove power stages for lower power cards to reduce costs. Since the VBIOS contains the information about the cards power delivery altering it can make the card push itself beyond what it can handle.,Neutral
AMD,"> Edit: You risk melting the 8 pin connectors if you push past 300w, since none of these cards come with 3 connections.

AMD,> you need to use integrated graphics at that point.  I genuinely think a lot of people forget that basically every CPU made in the past decade or more on Intel and any Ryzen on AM5 has an iGPU.  So flashing a card is honestly not a big deal at all.  It's just that this specific bios flash gives a laughable amount of extra performance for the power increase.  This is as far from a Phenom X2 to X4 situation as it gets. Nothing is unlocked. The only thing changing is the power limit.,Neutral
AMD,"This time round its probably worth it more than ever, i had the XT bios on my RX 5700 Pulse but the cooling just was not sufficient it would throttle hard with the unlocked power limit.

AMD,The 9070 XT can pull above 300W stock and significantly above 300W with overclocking despite using the same amount of 8 pin power connectors. The PCIe slot provides up to 75W of power in addition so up to 375W continuous power draw is within spec.  I'd be much more worried about cards using the 12VHPWR connector as these actually have melted even in stock conditions without exceeding the 600W rating.  Nothing's gonna melt on a 9070 except the silicon itself. Or maybe the fans achieve liftoff. One of these will come before the connector has a chance to melt.,Neutral
AMD,"I went from 270w on the stock bios to pulling 348w with the XT bios, so nearly 80w more power and now the clocks are consistently over 3300 while gaming. The only downside has been the slightly increased hotspot temps, but they're still in the low 80's. I have a Sapphire Pure 9070 which uses the same cooler as the XT variant. There are several XT's that only have 2x 8-pin connectors and there is no problems with power delivery.",Neutral

AMD,"It says ""future GPU architectures will support DGF"" but I'm fairly certain RDNA4 does as well, correct?",Neutral
AMD,"**TL;DR:**   AMD has announced their DGF format is compatible with animated geometry, where it incurs an insignificant cost of less than 1% of overall frame time.  Dense Geometry Format is used to lower BVH side RT ms overhead.  AMD confirmed HW based DGF decompression for RDNA 5 while current AMD GPUs rely on shaders.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes all cards technically support it but they mean support for HW based decompression. From earlier post from February: *""Dense Geometry Format (DGF) is a block-based geometry compression technology developed by AMD, which will be directly supported by future GPU architectures""*  If I were to guess RDNA 5 based cards and the next gen consoles will have a decompression engine inside each ray accelerator similar to how NVIDIA added a DMM accelerator with 40 series.   This isn't just some baseless speculation there's actually a patent for this in case someone is interested: [https://patents.google.com/patent/US20250131640A1/en](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20250131640A1/en)  This quote is interesting as well:   *""Quantization took less than 1% of the overall frame time, which means this process will not majorly affect rendering times in an animation pipeline. Likewise, animating the position data (Animation) has an almost insignificant contribution to the frametime. BVH Build and Ray Trace dominate the image computation.""*  **TL;DR:** Animating geometry has an insignificant impact on the ray tracing ms cost. ~~IIRC rn animated geometry is usually not implemented in RT games due to BVH overhead concerns.~~ *It's about rebuilds and inefficient BVH management rn not animated geometry overhead. PTLAS to the rescue!*",Neutral
AMD,"As I understand it DGF is a technique for compressing geometry to reduce memory usage and at least in the first paper, reduces performance when tracing. The memory reduction is like a factor of 6x but tracing can be slowed by like 2x. This site is showing that you can slot animation into DGF cheaply (i.e. change the vertex positions and rebuild the blocks). In reality the cost of animating geometry with RT had little to do with the cost of transforming the vertices, GPUs are very good at that.  Touching any part of geometry means you need to rebuild the BVH or you'll be missing movement in the ray traced representation. DGF doesn't address this (its implementation isn't strictly connected to BVHs, although the meshlet blocks can be used as leaves in the structure). So it is expected that BVHs and ray tracing would remain the expensive part since the same stuff happens with or without DGF. Like you stated, the cost of this process is why it's not usually implemented in RT games - the less geometry you change, the more you can delay rebuilding or do partial updates instead. This article is just showing that DGF holds for dense animating geometry too",Neutral
AMD,"Thanks for providing additional context from earlier blogpost and papers. Ms overhead is an issue for sure which is why AMD is opting for HW accel in RDNA 5.  One thing for certain is that AMD NEEDS their own RTX Mega Geometry competitor. Especially PTLAS otherwise like you said if they animate just one asset then nonstop BVH rebuilds.   Intel already unveiled Micro-mesh CBLAS in a paper over 2 years ago, and during Summer they unveiled PTLAS support. Meanwhile RTX Mega Geometry implemented in UE5, proprietary engines etc.... and as usual where's AMD. Maybe when DXR 1.3 arrives AMD will bother to do a proper implementation.",Neutral
AMD,"Absolutely. DGF with HW acceleration could be great if it could make decompression free, then they could reap memory benefits (if it was adopted, it requires baking to use). RTX Mega Geometry existing kills off any excitement for DGF for me, DGF seems like AMDs answer to DMMs which were lower quality but 3x better at compressing and faster to decompress. Meanwhile DMM acceleration has been killed off from 50 series in favor of Mega Geometry which handles every case DGF wants to: granular BVH, clusters, partial rebuilds, memory reduction. Which also works on earlier series...  Nanite seems to have proven to everyone clusters are the next step in LOD management. Intel Micro mesh, NVIDIA CLAS. I was unaware of PTLAS (thank you for inspiring a deep dive!) but you are right, Intel and NVIDIA again. Shocking AMD do not have any response to either feature (yet??). I guess Project Redstone is probably their focus right now? They absolutely need a response to Mega Geometry!  Edit: I suppose if they can get HW accel building to be fast enough, DGF leaf node BVH could achieve some of the same benefits since its effectively a cluster BVH (which AMD tested by using primitives, maybe their next target to implement in hardware?). I'm not entirely convinced where DGF is going without more insight into the hardware/software limitations",Positive
AMD,"As usual NVIDIA keeps moving the goalpost and AMD responding to prev gen one (DMM) gen too late (RTX MG).   Like you said Mesh shading and continuous LOD isn't going anywhere. So it seems. Catching up to CUDA, DLSS and porting FSR4 to PS5 Pro prob takes all their SW side ressources beyond graphics R&D :( You're welcome.    Well look at their pathetic responses to DXR 1.2 and the recent Advanced Shader delivery on the DirectX blog. AMD really needs to up their SW and HW game and I doubt we'll hear a single word on CBLAS + PTLAS SDK from AMD until RDNA 5 gets launched, but hope I'm wrong.   The Vulkan Github documentation for MG is a treasure trove for anyone interested. Look to the left section for documents ending with .md, truly great stuff! [https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk\_lod\_clusters/blob/main/docs/blas\_sharing.md](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_lod_clusters/blob/main/docs/blas_sharing.md)  And it's not like they don't have the talent to push things hard, Holger Gruens and Carsten Benthin former Intel, Matthäus Chajdas and many others. There's just seemingly a lack of will at AMD to really push things except for their GPU workgraphs push which does deserve huge applause.  We'll see, but that would be the next logical step similar to what NVIDIA does in 50 series (new ray/tri engine). Yeah more info needed to be disclosed by AMD but reading the Github documentation for MG this isn't close to being enough. AMD really needs to plan based on DGF not existing, because there's no guarantees devs will even bother to use it.    Still Dense geo format does have interesting use cases beyond BVH management, but that's speculative patent based derived analysis (Look for the KeplerL2 patents shared in the NeoGAF forums a while back: [https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-ps6-early-specs-leak-amd-rdna-5-lower-price-than-ps5-pro.1686842/page-12#post-270687172](https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-ps6-early-specs-leak-amd-rdna-5-lower-price-than-ps5-pro.1686842/page-12#post-270687172)   Not confirmed in any way by AMD. But it looks ideal for a parallel wide INT-based prefiltering testing setup to cull triangles before expensive floating point tests but what do I know. Either way interesting stuff.",Negative
AMD,"Very interesting, AMD are taking advantage of DGF for rapid and wide culling to speed up intersection testing. This could indeed be their way of hardware accelerating cluster intersections, although I'm intrigued what the practical uplift this gives nor how they address building new clusters. I have no idea what NVIDIA did to achieve the same on prior gens.  I also had no idea NV MG BLAS info was posted. It's conceptually simple but it's a very smart intuition that since RT with a good accelerator is less tri constrained, you can just reuse high poly BLAS and forego swapping LODs. I'm guessing Ray Reconstruction is very useful here to cut back on any extreme aliasing. Very curious now to see how they managed to optimize animated geometry, maybe heavy partitioning with lazy BLAS refit or just brute force rebuilds. Regardless NVIDIA is obviously far ahead with a more united stack of solutions.  Despite AMDs talent I find it more impressive that Intel manage to keep up with graphics developments much quickly. XeSS, ExtraSS, cluster and partition acceleration structures, etc. Their media encoders have also remained competitive. AMDs strategy is a bit confusing to me especially with how they're dragging out RDNA3.5 in new products. I hope UDNA impresses.  Thank you for the reading material, you are very well informed 😁",Positive
AMD,"Number one   Yeah so it seems at based on the AMD patents, but it's not just DGF patents, they also have a fallback method called prefiltering nodes, which is probably very similar to how the RTX Mega geometry clusters work on 50 series, but I could be wrong and like you said NVIDIA doesn't exactly spill the beans on architectural intricacies. While DGF is superior (compression and memory accesses characteristics) this fallback is also made for rapid and wide culling like you said.  Apparently the idea is to precompute a set of quantized BVH data matching the full precision data. It can even be leveraged for ray/box intersections but it seems like triangles will benefit the most.   From what I can read INT operations are multiple times more ressource efficient than FP. That is all PPA characteristics, power, performance at area. From what I can read online it's anywhere from 3-5X, might be wrong, but the patents directly mention ""multiple times more"" so it's at least 3x. In effect AMD can probably shrink the current FP pipeline down, given it'll only be used for inconclusive final tests, and at little cost to die area implement a very wide parallel intersection tester unit that eats ray/tri intersection tests for breakfast.      Another benefit of DGF is that you can include pretty much all the relevant data within one node, so you do just one memory access for the entire block and you can begin doing RT. For example opacity micro maps data has a header within the DGF block. Still no info on subdivisions + tesselations but that's no doubt coming as well given MG supports it, or it'll be included in an accompanying template similar to MG. They also talk about rays coalesced against the same node in the patents, where you mass test rays at once before removing the DGF data, but IDK if that's how things are done today already.  Github FTW! Yeah me to as usual NVIDIA holding their cards close :/ I'm pretty sure the animations rely heavily on subdivisions and tesselation based on this: [https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk\_animated\_clusters](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_animated_clusters) This simplifies the underlying geometry and should massively speed up rebuilds and avoid them entirely.  For sure, NVIDIA as always ahead of the competition and look at the joke of MS's DXR 1.2. Embracing NVIDIA's functionality over 2 years later and it's still not shipping till Q1 2026, while SER and OMM has been supported since Q4 2022 xD on NVIDIA side.  Intel has long played a leading role in graphics and ray tracing for a long time, before NVIDIA even introduced RTX + has invested a lot in research and is behind a lot of open source SW used in rendering applications. In addition, like NVIDIA, Intel went all AI and HW accell, for example they planned to have SER one year before NVIDIA, but Alchemist got delayed.   Meanwhile AMD used the bean counter approach of wait and see and relying on shaders, they still rely on that for BVH processing. Meanwhile NVIDIA and Intel took the full RT core approach right from the start. Look at where that got them. 5 years of ignoring ML super res only to go all in last minute with FSR 4 + no DLL swap until very recently (FSR 3.1) despite NVIDIA having that for over 5 years. I mean who TF runs that SW department, this is incredibly stupid. I agree that AMD's approach makes no sense.",Neutral
AMD,"Number 2  RDNA 4 is really just a stopgap nothing more, similar to RDNA 1. They also had Vega iGPU for many gens until RDNA 2 came along, RDNA 3.5 looks to be another repeat of that. RDNA 5/UDNA is poised to be another RDNA 2 full stack moment except this time probably a lot better and less complacent on the SW side.  Me too but based on all the changes suggested in patents (we'll see how many actually ends up in products) + rumours of a clean slate overhaul not seen since GCN in 2011 the picture is slowly taking form and best case assuming NVIDIA keeps rebranding Ampere cores (they really haven't done foundational changes since then) gen the nextgen from AMD could be the most competitive since the Terascale based HD series.  Not gonna spill the beans on the patents today, it's too early but right before launch, then perhaps I might eventually do another post similar to the one I did in the Spring that was picked up by tech media. All you need to know is that AMD id seemingly doing a fundamental overhaul of pretty much every aspect of a GPU, with a particularly strong focus on cachemem system efficiency and data locality.  But I can tell about the major scheduling changes in some of the patents, but it's really just the tip of the iceberg alongside the DGF + prefilter stuff.   Scheduling will go from top down orchestrated to localized hierarchical scheduling and dispatch down to the CU unit. Scheduling will be offloaded to Shader Engines with the command processor job being only to prepare work items and do load balancing between Shader Engines through ""work stealing"" indicated on idle or overloaded signals from the individual Shaders Engines. As a new thing scheduling and dispatch can be decoupled from the SPI completely at the CU level allowing each WorkGroup processor to dispatch its own work queue with unprecedented granularity and latency. The patent mentions an order of magnitude improvement in thread launch performance.  I have a post in here on that from \~8 weeks ago in case you're interested that goes more into depth. All this is to deliver better core scaling and prob drive increased performance for branchy code and GPU Work Graphs API workloads. An API that looks like AMD's new Mantle except it's a much bigger deal, Programmable shaders 2.0 really.",Neutral

AMD,"Been waiting for High Yield's Strix Halo deep dive (just waiting for Chips and Cheese).  Reconfirming what we know, Granite Ridge CCDs are different to the ones found in Strix Halo requiring a new tape-out. 4% in die space savings when moving from SERDES GMI-narrow links to RDL fan-out interconnect (using TSMC InFO-oS). This may be one of the reasons why we see lower than expected volume for STX-H and it's high price tag (not to mention it's large IOD is \~307mm2).  The benefits of the new 'sea-of-wires' is lower power for data transfer, so lower voltages for freq, which is what you'd find sipping power on current desktop Ryzens on the IOD (also memory) and lower latency and higher bandwidth. [u/high\_yield\_yt](https://www.reddit.com/user/high_yield_yt/) used Aida's $/mem benchmark, which I've barely come across so it's finally nice to see some numbers and as you can see bandwidth is orders of magnitude higher.

Or make a scalable IOD where one IOD can hold 8 or 10 CCDs split over two side, has all the phys on the third side and can connect to another IOD on the fourth side totalling 16-20 CCDs, with two sides dedicated for phys for high end epyc, and single IOD for mid-range epyc with up to 8 or 10 CCDs.",Neutral

AMD,"AFAIK the contact density from CCD to cache die on Zen 5 X3D is significantly higher than CCD to substrate on Strix Halo. Making a bunch of TSV on the cache die as passthrough for the interconnect on CCD and aligning them properly shouldn't require higher precision than production of current Zen 5 X3D. This way AMD can align the contact at the bottom of CCD with the TSV on cache die and fan out from the bottom of cache die.  I think cache die below CCD on Strix Halo like package is doable, but it may come at a power cost due to the signal going through an extra layer of TSV.  Regarding L4 on IOD, AMD has already said they can do it on Strix Halo, but GPU benefit from the cache more so all the MALL is reserved for the GPU, however, they can configure it to be used by CPU with ""flip of a bit"".

AMD,"> Wouldn't it be viable to move the 3DVCache either as L4 or with an entire L3 implementation onto the IOD which probably has some colder locations and with the new interconnect might still offer very good latency?  Why not have the cache stacked on top of the CCDs to expand the existing L3 cache, and another stacked cache on the IOD to serve as a L4 cache?  There's also the IBM method from a decade ago where they give every core a large L2 cache, and a portion of the L2 cache can be tagged by another core to be used as a virtual L3 cache. Or a CPU die can use another CPU die's L2 caches as a virtual L4 cache (as long as the CPU dies are on the same package to avoid communicating over the motherboard). In theory, a single core in an entire CPU package could address about 8GB cache with the virtual L3 and L4 setup. This allows their mainframe CPUs to switch between workloads where it favors large L2 caches and workloads where a large L3/L4 cache is preferred.",Neutral
AMD,"You absolutely CAN do that. But latency, bandwidth, and power will be worse, as the signal will need to travel significantly further. The further away a signal needs to go, the worse it becomes in nearly all aspects.  The easy solution is just move the Vcache over a little bit to not sit right where the info goes.  And if you need more? why not stack it back on top as well? I realize at some point interconnects to the vcache get crazy. But there are a LOT of ways to handle this. it's an engineering problem that has many practical solutions.",Negative
AMD,"L4 on IOD is better anyway because it benefit both chiplets. It acts as a buffer between System memory and L3.   The issue is on the server side, Epyc has 12 chiplets, that means to get equivalent of 12 chiplet 3D Cache, that L4 on the IOD is going to need to be very huge.",Positive
AMD,Interesting thoughts. With this interconnect the latency probably wouldn't be an issue (it's way better than 2 serde jumps for cross-ccd latency on current ryzens). And there's a lot of space on top of the IOD to potentially get even more cache.,Positive
AMD,"It depends on the difference in latency moving data from the cache between the dies. I still think the lowest odds are that they just stack the v-cache on top of the CCDs going forward. They're going to have separate SKUs for v-cache parts for cost reasons anyway, so customers will still be able to get the higher clocking parts if that's what their workload benefits from.",Neutral

AMD,"You are completely missing the fact that the SerDes is aggregating many channels of digital signals into a single line.  Thus it has to have signal transitions many times faster, which requires stronger drive signals and more current.  A single inFO line is running much slower than a single serdes line from the previous design and thus is driving much less current and thus does not require unchanged resistance.  You are also ignoring line capacitance which is more important than resistance for high speed signals.  The power needed to drive switching signals is proportional to the line capacitance \* frequency\^2.  You are basically having to fill or empty a little capacitor on each transition.  So individually the lower switching frequency InFo lines save on both frequency and capacitance.

This might prove to be simple and coherency for multi-ccd variants might be more efficient to maintain.   Best case would be sufficiently low latency and high enough throughput such that it could act as a good dedicated L4 or integrate even tighter with the L3 of the CCD but on the IOD.    Of course it is none-trivial to ""just"" move the cache onto the IOD and the purpose of the cache might need to be redesigned.

AMD,"still not over io die, I believe. Architecturally that cache is still inside the CPU.  Edit 1: On Pentium II, where the CPU contains 2 dies, one is CPU itself, the other is the cache. The whole CPU is on a board that plug onto the motherboard that contains north bridge and south bridge. So, no the cache is not on IO die (north/south bridge chips)  Edit 2: people down vote me have no idea how cache works. The cache memory is not indexed by regular memory address, they are mapped/indexed by content. To have a hit/miss in cache, CPU logic circuit needs to go through a serial (row-by-row) of data storage that contains a mapping pair of memory addresses and cache address. When the memory address match (cache hit) , it takes the cache address and go to cache memory and load the data. Because the CPU needs to match this table serially, the cache is always pretty small otherwise the cache miss penalty will be huge. Therefore, it is hard for this to be outside of CPU, architecturally or physically.",Neutral

No... That's not how cache works at all.  Most modern caches are typically 4-way or 8-way [set associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_placement_policies#Set-associative_cache) (other numbers are possible, but 4-8 tends to work best).   With a 4-way set associative cache, the lower bits of the memory address are used to select a single set within the cache, which stores four cache lines. The data is guaranteed to be in one of those four memory locations (or not at all).   Which makes lookups very fast, you look at the memory address to find which set it should be in, and fetch that set's tags from the tag array. All four tags can be checked in parallel with special hardware, and then it knows exactly where in cache the data will be found.   -----  The cache needs to be small because of physics. A combination of speed of light delays and (more importantly) capacitance means the larger the array, the higher the access times.",Neutral

Enable PBO (not sure if your motherboard allows that for the 5800X3D).  4. Then enable the XMP.  If the idle power shoots up with XMP, it might be the motherboard is overvolting things to guarantee Infinity Fabric and RAM stability. In that situation, you may have to manually configure the IF and RAM settings, and all of the associated voltages, to take the voltage control away from the motherboard.

If you're going up to 8 CCDs then you're probably looking at a ring bus topology for distributing cache... and at that point it MIGHT make sense to centralize the last level cache on the IOD.

AMD,"You have no idea what I am talking about. Products like the Orin (I own an Orin), Spark, and Thor are all arm based solutions. They do not really matter in the space I'm talking about (consumer LLM usage). Right now some of the best devices you can get in the consumer LLM space are these Strix Halo APUs (that and Apple's M4 chips). Nvidia doesn't have a direct competitor and doesn't attempt to get one because they are very ARM and Enterprise centric. ARM because of their long history with ARM and the technology they leeched off of Mellanox (I have used Bluefield 1/2/3s) and Enterprise because that's where the absurd profits are. Gamers see no value in the massive price inflation that happens past 24 of VRAM, especially when Coding LLMs really need 32/48GB of VRAM these days for best inferencing.  There is exactly 1 consumer GPU from Nvidia that can do 32GB of VRAM and it's the 5090. AMD has Strix Halo. Apple has numerous Apple Silicon products. Yes these iGPUs perform _very_ well with LLM workloads because most LLM workloads are heavily bottlenecked by IO throughput and unified memory delivers that.  Everyone knows that 32GB+ of unified memory (or dedicated VRAM) is in demand but gamers because gamers are using toys and not doing actual work.",Neutral

AMD,"I wouldn't say that it has the same speed if i was talking about models that fit in a 3090. The 3090 would run circles around it.  Moe models at around \~80-100GB with llama.cpp will run at the same speed in a ddr5 100GB/s bandwidth mainsteam system with some parts of the model + the KV cache in a 3090 or 5060ti. You will also have 16-24gb more free ram for other uses and far better prompt processing  It may look as a good option, but it doesn't offer anything for AI, except for portable devices.",Neutral

The only benefit from strix halo is offering lots of relatively fast ram but performance really lacks behind nvidia and Apples offers.  Why exactly don't Digits Spark or Jetson count?    You're throwing both development work on LLMs (professional workload) and consumers (which you cannot define?   NVIDIAs jetsons can be used as a desktop PC with Linux it and they can even run games. But Software support can still be an issue in some, especially windows. But that's why nvidia announced x86 versions literally today.   Most LLM devs run hardware like this as servers anyway. There is no point in giving each developer its own training system. And most want to LLMs on Linux but still use Windows for their desktop.   But yes, for people who only want one system, do heavy llm development but don't care that much about performance and don't mind having their desktop system doing the heavy work all the time, can only run Windows but don't mind paying a lot of money, Strix Halo is the only option.

Reading through it, it seems that almost all of the scoring difference came from CPU based inference benchmarks and AVX512 support for machine vision.

AMD,"This isn’t true either - if the heat load (in watts) is the same, at steady state the same amount of watts gets dumped into your room. A worse cooler just has the CPU get hotter; the temperature getting hotter enables the worse cooler to move the same amount of watts out of the CPU.",Negative
AMD,"If you're not mem OCing or running really high performance memory, then temp doesn't matter. It's just jarring that DDR5 really cares about what exact temperature it is rather than DDR4's just ""below 75c in general"".  That kit's timings aren't that tight and the voltage is average, pardon my French, but I wouldn't give two shits about what temperature they are if I were you. It's not running tight enough for the temperature to have an effect on what is and is not stable. And with an X3D chip you don't have the power limit/boost headroom to really strain your VRM's, so as long as they have a heat pipe and some fins I also wouldn't care about what temperature they are, MOSFET's can burn and be perfectly content.  Ofc, the CPU will care about low temps if you're doing PBO offsets per-core.  [Some games are insanely sensitive to RAM performance.](https://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/18z4rm9/some_fresh_zen4_ramif_overclock_scaling_data/)  Even with an X3D chip here, it's jarring how much performance is dictated by memory performance.  Do note the only game/test in these charts that seems to have any measurable performance impact from bandwidth is Riftbreaker, and even Riftbreaker still performs better with lower latency than higher performance. For a game like Path of Exile or Star Citizen, bandwidth is a bit more relevant.",Neutral
AMD,"That's what case fans do, yes. Temperature delta between inside/outside of case can be shockingly high without a lot of airflow. Unless you have a chimney setup, which is actually kind of hard to setup and get working properly...",Neutral
AMD,"You're right. I was thinking in terms of an insufficient cooler, one that makes the CPU thermally throttle. If both coolers are ""sufficient"" (as in, both coolers are capable of moving enough heat to where the CPU is not forced to thermally throttle) then they will both emit the same heat, to my understanding. The difference will be in the CPU temperature. You're definitely right on that front",Neutral
AMD,"any heat energy that stays on the CPU (CPU gets hotter) is heat energy not transfered outside the case. I agree the difference here would be immaterial, but technically better CPU cooler does mean hotter room.",Neutral
AMD,case fans often have less impact than people think. the CPU fan already creates enough airflow that in a well designed case without external blocking the heat gets expelled just fine through the back-plate.,Neutral
AMD,"My experience is intake matters more than exhaust. You are correct in that your components will make their own air path, but intake fans are important for getting a good air circuit in the space around the case, as well as getting some airflow over board components like the chipset, RAM.  In that regard, I've found high CFM intakes to do the best job.",Neutral
AMD,"Guess AMD will keep doing new am4 releases till am5 dies lmao. I wonder what happened with the whole bios problem to support new am4 releases?

AMD,"Always great to have options. My guess is this will be in some budget prebuilds as well. AMD was smart to not kill AM4 in early/mid life of AM5. When you hop on AM4 and use AMD as a platform it's more likely you will continue to do so with next gen platform - so folks who go online for advice will either get the ""Go AM5 + 7500F/7600 for budget, great uplift"" or ""Skip AM5, jump to AM6"" it's a win for AMD in both cases.",Positive

AMD,5500X or 5550 would have been a more understandable name... but then a problem is that it clocks lower than even the 5500. So then it's a battle between full fat Vermeer but clocked in its lowest form vs. Cezanne with half the cache and only PCIe Gen3.,Neutral
AMD,"These are just chips that failed binning. When you're using a manufacturing process that have good yields, your binning only gets a few that don't pass the requirements in each bactch.

AMD,What's fake about it? It's still incredibly popular due to the continued support.,Neutral
AMD,Are you kidding? People love this,Positive
AMD,"Imo, the main benefit is that the CPU's are still in production, which puts enormous pressure on the used market and increases the supply overall in the long run. And as new generations come out, the last generation prices get lower and lower.  Often, the fastest generation for a socket ends up with a steep premium on the used market after production ends, but Zen 3 has been sold for long that there's a massive supply of it.

AMD,"yeah, its an optimization of the stack that AMD did that I think Intel needed to do for the turnaround, esp with chiplets that can scale up and down.  I think its a good idea if the pricing was good, that means bottom of the market naturally gets better over time if your top end is pushed.

AMD,Because most consumers will balk at dropping $650+ on a GPU.,Negative
AMD,"And who is going to be buying 9070 XT's? The only thing it offers over the 5070 Ti is a price advantage and street pricing has been more favorable towards Nvidia with NV cards showing up far more often at MSRP than the 9070 XT has. The smaller the NV tax, the smaller the reason to go AMD.  NV also has the Borderlands 4 promotion going on now, so even in my case where I can walk into Microcenter and get either one of these cards at MSRP, if I value the BL4 promotion at all, the pricing gap has now shrunk in favor of NV.",Neutral

AMD,"Not true.  If you buy a RX 5700 \[RDNA 1\] today it will come with many compromises that will make them not worth it even on used market anymore such as not supporting DX12 Ultimate and proper Upscaling such as DLSS.

No reviewers other than Digital Foundry saw the future of Upscaling and DX12 Ultimate features, everyone is stuck on Rasterization only matters mindset.",Negative
AMD,None of the AMD cards in the last 3 generations have aged well. All of them were significantly lacking in features which at the time many downplayed the significance of but it has come back to bite them.   Whereas on the Nvidia side only the VRAM crippled cards have not aged well. But that's something one could have seen coming from a mile away.,Negative
AMD,Not because of that. Because of RTX and upscaling.  The 2060 Super and 5700 were nearly the same price. But the 2060 Super would have given you a significantly better experience due to supporting DLSS upscaling. Even if you ignore all the other features that came with RTX,Positive
AMD,"I remember seeing people showing 3060 12gb vs 3070 8gb and 70 series absolutely make sense.   In my experience (1660ti 6gb) i had to lower settings anyway to hit framerate that was relevant. Sure 16gb had been fun on that card, but loading settings that require that much would push me to 20fps or less anyway, because it just ain’t faster.      I’ll gladly enable DLSS / fsr and many are the same. I would always pick the higher tier.     With that said, 8gb is really not a lot today cause most new gpu DO have enough punch to atleast use up to 12gb….

AMD,"> lmao you are smoking crack if you think 8GB vram is enough  I literally use an 8gb card. Did you even watch the video?   > this is tw3, a 2015 game  I don't know why you're emphasizing the year of release as if it didn't get a heavy next gen update just 2-3 years ago. It's almost like if I took half life 2 rtx and made a heavy emphasis on it being from 2004 or oblivion remaster being from 2006 as if the original release year has fuck all to do with how heavy the shit they piled on top of the already existing game is.   Regardless, I can run that game on my 8gb 4070 laptop, a substantially less powerful card than yours with less VRAM and capped at like 105 watts, at 1440p medium with ray tracing on dlss balanced and [it's still getting 45-50fps with no frame generation](https://i.imgur.com/BbkvmVE.jpeg). It's playable without stutters. You know what I'd do if it got to the point of being unplayable? And I know this is extremist: I'd turn a setting or two down. Fucking crazy right? That not everything has to run at 4k240hz max ray tracing all the time, especially in the budget category? Turning off the ray tracing alone doubles my fps, which is what I personally would do in this game if I ever got around to actually playing it. I don't think you know what ""unplayable"" means.  > it should need at least 12-14GB for 2160p ultrawide, so i'm stuck with monitor upscaling. an 5k2k   The fact that you're even bringing up **4k ultrawide** in a conversation about a **budget** card that has been selling for **$225-270** is telling me that I'm not the one ""smoking crack"" here.",Negative

AMD,"because how small the jump in raw raster was from 10 series, and how much prices shot up  the 1k+ 2080 ti was a shocker for the top end buyers, and then if you went for 2080 as normal, you got a huge % difference in performance because its just like the 5090 vs 5080 were on entirely different chips that was massively cut down vs salvage die of 30 series.  the 20 series was a massive cash grab, make no mistake. the DLSS being good is a much later development.",Neutral

Now forwarding looking concepts like ray tracing (a holy Grail type of feature to PC gamers of the 90s), YouTubers didn't like it and kept slamming Nvidia for working on it while praising AMD for charging consumers more for raster performance.   These hacks, HUB, still stood by their RX 5700 XT recommendation when they did a retrospect video during the mesh shader nonsense.   People finally going to wake up?

AMD,No bad gpus only bad prices. Rdna1 isnt being hailed as a dx12ultimate game machine right now. Same with rtx 20 series. You wont be able to enjoy the games that require the tech that dx12u requires. Maybe except for 2080ti. Which you paid 1000 bucks at 2018 (1200 of todays dollars) and yes it aged well as hardware. But it still wasnt worth it waiting 6+ years for tech to mature with a 1000 dollar sticker price. And with rt features it offered at launch. Push back is completely justified for an uncooked featureset.,Negative
AMD,">No reviewers other than Digital Foundry saw the future of Upscaling and DX12 Ultimate features, everyone is stuck on Rasterization only matters mindset.   It was just Nvidia's marketing, quite frankly.  DF's track record isn't nearly as squeaky clean as one might think.  They were the only ones at the time who were ""impressed"" by DLSS version ""1.9"" in Control (basically DLSS 1.0 with minor tweaks), which wasn't entirely dissimilar to FSR 2.0 and ran on standard FP32.  Yet, they kept comparing it with PS4 Pro's vastly inferior checkerboard rendering technique to present it in a positive light.   In hindsight, it was 'probably' IGN that was twisting their arms behind the scenes, but that's hardly an excuse for bad (or at least biased) journalism.",Negative
AMD,"Rasterization is good though. Nvidia is pushing for software gimmicks to act as makeup for game developers. Just like how developers decided to make games bloated because of storage, developers will make games increasingly shittier to run outside of DLSS and frame gen.

Most people should be buying for now, not the promise of possibility, the ones who keep saying fine wine in a serious way are a joke for sure.   The pricing of the 20 series at launch was ASS, even with hindsight here, RX 5700 XT was 400 bucks, which it trades blows on average with the 2070 that was 500 dollars (although, at the time it was HEAVILY game dependent, where some it would outpace very well others just die). The exact trade off that gets made later, but this time at a much more acceptable price point, 100 dollars less on a 400/500 dollars product is actually sizable, not so much on a 1000 dollar product.   The lack of features for DLSS didn't matter until really 30s gen when the updated DLSS came out, and really until the latter point of it or 40 series when it got mass adoption.  If your upgrade cycle is 2 cycles, it was a good idea and then pick up a 40 series because by then DLSS really did come into its own, and AMD's lack of competition then was an issue (that they worked to address with PS upscaling that turned into FSR4)",Negative

AMD,"> DLSS version ""1.9"" in Control (basically DLSS 1.0 with minor tweaks)  DLSS 1 was a spatial AI upscale, DLSS ""1.9"" was a temporal upscaler, they were nothing alike, not ""DLSS 1 with minor tweaks""",Neutral
AMD,"First off even DLSS 1.9 looks far better than the FSR 2, FSR 2 only looked close when comparing between standstill image which gave some false analysis which most of the tech journalist were guilty off including Hardware Unboxed. And DLSS 1.9 is barely relevant to use anyways as that version of DLSS AFAIK only were used on a single game.  Everything else eventually used DLSS 2, which on comparisons has proven itself to be much better as well compared to FSR.  Second IGN at the time doesn't own Digital Foundry they were under Eurogamer at the time and by then they were still independent, they were only purchased by IGN back on 2024 and then Digital Foundry eventually bought their independence back off them just recently this year.  Some people like you keep saying that they are biased or bad journalist, when in reality they seem to be the most mature of them all especially compared to the likes of Hardware Unboxed, Gamers Nexus and every other tech tuber which seems to rely on gamer rage click bait to get views nowadays.  No offense to them I still appreciate their content and still watches them to this day. But any day I prefer the likes of Digital Foundry which focuses more on technical state of the games they are reviewing also, plenty of game developer interviews that gives us more insight on how the future of visual game rendering technology is going to be in the future, which they correctly predicted with Upscaling as well as Ray Tracing, DX 12 Ultimate features in general rather than the Hardware rasterization focused only.  Which gave us some false insight on what the future is going to be like. Back in 2019 everyone is focuses on rasterization only matters, upscaling, ray tracing bad train.  6 years later it's very obvious which became the standard, and this is something like subreddit like r/pcmasterrace will never admit, I guess.",Neutral
AMD,"That's not going to happen. They may choose to call it ""FSR 4"" but it will look nothing like it.",Negative
AMD,PS6 might full AI with fsr4 or fsr5. Fsr4 was created in collaboration with Sony. Sony vision is most likely going for ML upscaling with their upcoming consoles,Neutral
AMD,"That's not how that works.   Again, the point is it aged a lot better. You basically got a ""free"" \~30% performance boost over the AMD counterpart.   Fundamentally the 20 series cards are technologically not too different from today's cards. That's why something like a 2080 Ti is still pretty damn good, and even a 2060 Super is perfectly usable (around RX 6600 XT performance, but with upscaling, so real world way better experience).   Meanwhile let's be honest, the 5600 XT or 5700 are like stone age tech. And even the RX 6600 cards are worse than the 20 series cards. It's just crazy.",Positive

AMD,I wouldnt call more than a generational different a few percent.,Neutral
AMD,"yep, and 30 series was a time of grab what you can. MSRP was not a thing if you brought off the shelf, everything was inflated to fuck.  I was able to sell a 999 2080 TI black edition (IE the shitty ones from evga) for 900 in person all cash, and that was doable because I got a 3080 ti aio one from evga from the queue and that was a small enough outlay that I just went for it.  it was a wild time and the only time I ever flipped a GPU because how stupid things were.  The 20 series was a shitshow, it started the DLSS tech sure, but the gen itself was a shitshow of uplifts, and very much not worth buying at the time because the tech was just so not good at the time. sure, DLSS means that if you buy a used 2080 it would be able to do a lot more than something without DLSS like a 1080 ti (which had close enough perf but drastic cheaper at the time) or if you want 2070 vs 1080 ti that would have had a way bigger win on 1080 ti on raw raster but the dlss means you can try and stretch the thing that much longer.",Negative

I brought a 2080 ti to run a 4k screen because I brought one super early to pair with a 980 ti, and really it wasnt until way later I can use DLSS to actually help running with games, the first major one where I felt it was actually helpful and necessary was launch cyberpunk 2077 partly because that was when it was starting to struggle to hit 4k60 with games, and partly because that was when DLSS was getting to the point where it looked good enough to properly upscale even at 4k compared with DLSS 1 that was a joke.

Worst case scenario features never get used, you end up same as if you picked other product, best case scenario features get used and end ahead likely ahead of if you picked other product.

AMD,"Increasing the bus width definitely increases die space, but not by much if you start from an already big die. To make a cut-down version with a narrower bus, you first need to weigh in the cost of the redesign (although probably not huge), the cost of a full maskset for validation + most likely a new set for production, the cost of a new package design and manufacturing, the cost of the reduced economy of scale now that your top of the line and the lower tier do not share the same package, so the volumes are smaller for each, versus the cost of additional wafers due to the wasted die area if you stick with one single die for all SKUs. If you don't foresee to sell a lot of lower SKUs versus the top ones, it may not be worth going with two different dies.  EDIT: Also, the cost for faulty dies: if your bottom tier SKUs use a different die, you now can't bin down a partly defective high-end die into a lower SKU and instead you need to toss it. That's cost as well.",Neutral
AMD,"Binning, wafer allocation, and mask costs all argue in favor of using a single design for several SKU's.    It's one thing to say you can make a smaller die and get more per wafer, but it's another to put up the hundred million dollars plus it takes just to make the masks for that die.  Then you have to figure out how many wafers to make of one die versus another.  There's also the design costs, though I expect those would contribute less than the other factors to making a decision like this.  And, of course, you're really overestimating how much space on the die those memory PHY's are taking up.  The memory bus difference probably accounts for somewhere around 5% of the die at most.",Neutral
AMD,"They probably don't expect sales to be flat across the SKUs. If they're weighted more towards the upper end one, could make sense. ~~Alternatively, has it been confirmed they're only making a single die? If there are actually two, could explain it better.~~ [Edit: specs would probably rule this out]  Could also be a cost play. Higher end memory configs significant increase platform cost. Might be that they're expecting a number of OEMs to make that tradeoff, but they still want to advertise higher peak perf. Also possible it makes the lower 2 SKUs drop-in compatible, while the higher end one is a separate platform.",Neutral
AMD,"According to die photo such as this one https://www.techpowerup.com/327130/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-die-exposed-and-annotated?amp the memory are pretty small periphery circuits.   I'm not sure if they segment the packaging to save running the extra 64 traces and bumps, that is probably more expensive than the die area",Neutral
AMD,"When it comes to cost, you need to consider:  Case A (different design)  * Design & validation cost * Entire chips that would be wasted since its unbinnable  Case B (same design binned)  * Wasted die area on every non-flagship chip  Case A has a lot more upfront cost (2 designs, 2 validations, 2 contracts) and uncertainties (what if yield is low? what if memory is needed later down the line?), while case B is safer overall since in the grand scheme of things, memory controller is a small part of a die",Neutral
AMD,It's signal integrity thing. Lane voltage transition from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 level isn't instant.,Neutral
AMD,"What? We're talking N3, which is mature now. Even on relatively new nodes, you wouldn't expect to routinely cut 1/3rd of your memory bus.",Negative
AMD,This is more of a packaging issue than binning.   FWIW yield have gone up consistently with modern nodes if anything.,Neutral
AMD,"Yea, 287mm2 3nm is a HUGE jump up from 173mm2 4nm  Its only 2.3x faster GPU perf, so seems like the GPU is still only a tiny 3 Slices? Just upgraded from the 8g2 GPU arch to the 8Eg5 GPU arch & clocked higher?  Qualcomm's new P cores should be smaller from the node shrink, and the additional E cores+sL2 cluster should only be roughly ~10-15mm2  I don't understand where all the silicon went  Edit: I just did a die size estimate myself, I think Andreas used incorrect LPDDR5X packages dimensions  I got about 215mm2 using [LPDDR5X packages dimensions of 12.5 x 7.1mm2, same as in LNL](https://www.techpowerup.com/img/Ocdpo16i9bxAEUlk.jpg)  215mm2 is more in-line with what I'd expect based on the specs we currently know",Neutral
AMD,Do you have a source for that die size number?,Neutral
AMD,"Sacrificing a memory controller in the big scheme of things is far more efficient than having to spin a different die design for each SKU.  If anything Qualcomm is the less wasteful.   Apple and Intel do that at even larger scales BTW. E.g. M-series Max dies for example have all 16 scalar cores and 40 GPU cores, even though most common SKUs only have 14 scalar and 32 GPU cores enabled.  Similar thing with Intel, for many designs the i3,i5,i7 SKUs were basically the same die.",Neutral
AMD,"Apple literally does have several configurations for each tier.   For instance: the M4 alone has a 9-core CPU configuration for the base iPad Pro, an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU configuration for the base iMac and a 8-core GPU configuration for the base MacBook Air. All of them can be brought with the full-fat CPU and GPU config (which is 10 cores for each) but of course at a additional cost.",Neutral
AMD,Someone else posted a die shot. It looks like the entirety of the PHYs make up less than 5% area.,Neutral
AMD,"How unlikely is it that the memory controller actually supports lppddr6 as well, thus requiring a 192bit bus?",Neutral
AMD,What are the chances their anemic GPU can't saturate the full width and there's simply no benefit except at the high end for maximum memory capacity?,Neutral
AMD,Can you explain this further?,Neutral
AMD,"The binning is not about memory bus, but cores, caches and the clock speeds they can achieve.  Having the same memory bus for all of  your SKUs allows you to bin along your entire product range",Neutral
AMD,"Core count has gone up 50%, and caches/register files are also larger while SRAM hasn't scaled down that well from 4n to 3n for TSMC (and everybody else really).  It also has more PCIe lanes and a larger NPU. I don't know if they have integrated baseband on these SKUs (I read they were planning to a while back).  I am surprised they didn't prioritize GPU on this gen, since it was their big Achilles heel for 1st gen (on Oryon family).",Neutral
AMD,"They didn't say it was 2.3x faster, they said 2.3x performance per watt.  So I seriously doubt they are just clocking the GPU faster (the least power efficient method of increasing performance).  The NPU got a lot more performance as well.  So increased area for GPU/NPU/Memorybus.",Neutral
AMD,They went from 12 cores to 18 cores   And the P cores are using less dense transistors to reach 5Ghz   Hopefully they announce Snapdragon X Plus by CES too with their 12 cores which should have a die comparable to last gen,Positive
AMD,Memory bus it hogs die area as well also 80TOPS NPU can't be Cheap.,Neutral
AMD,everyone does binning but the point here is designing one extra 64-bit memory interface just for 1 SKU seems excessive,Neutral
AMD,"To my understanding, the way LPDDR6 structures its channels would make it impossible to translate the bus width 1:1 with LPDDR5. You'd have the option of 128b LPDDR5 vs 192b LPDDR6.",Neutral
AMD,"Very unlikely. When lppddr6 commercially releases it will be slower and more expensive than lpddr5x, it will likely take two more X Elite generations until lpddr6 is more viable.   Additionally the overhead to validate the platform for lpddr6 and to integrate compatibility is to high just for it to be a gimmick in maybe 18 months or so.",Negative
AMD,"The PCB, the copper wires may have resistance, capacitance or electromagnetic crosstalk/interference between each other. That's the reason why Strix Halo can't use LPDDR5X on a CAMM stick and the chips have to be around the SoC, very close to it.  Then there is binning of the chip. It may be that they went for a tradeoff of a cheaper designs in exchange for only perfect chips being stable at such bandwidth and speed and/or they could have designed a wider bus with the ability to fuse it off to 128-bit when defects show up. Like console chips have slightly more GPU cores that what you get in the product. They checked statistics and added extra cores to handle cores disabled by defects.",Neutral
AMD,"> The binning is not about memory bits, but cores, caches and the clock speeds they can achieve.  The X2 Elite (higher end, X2E-88-100) and X2 Elite Extreme (X2E-96-100) have the same core counts, both for CPU and GPU, as well as cache. It would not make sense to cut down the memory bus by 1/3rd just because of a couple hundred MHz.  Notice that essentially every client chip you can name ships with its full, native memory bus, regardless of other binning.  Edit: Added SKU numbers for clarity",Neutral
AMD,Don't forget power and thermal envelope.,Neutral
AMD,"Oh my bad, 2.3x performance per watt is far better  That would explain the jump in die size if the GPU is saying 2-3x larger",Neutral
AMD,"Oh true, it'll be interesting to see the 8Eg5 vs X2E core size difference for the reaching 5GHz  I hope Qualcomm doesn't nerf the X2 Plus' clock speeds so much this time",Positive
AMD,"M4 Max also has a group of memory controllers being disabled for it’s base config, cuts down the memory bandwidth from 546GB/s to 410GB/s",Neutral
AMD,> 128b LPDDR5 vs 192b LPDDR5.   Is one of those supposed to be a 6?,Neutral
AMD,"> It would not make sense to cut down the memory bus by 1/3rd just because of a couple hundred MHz.  But they want 3 SKUs with notably different performance. A few hundred more MHz will barely move the needle in benchmarks, but 50% more memory bandwidth will.  > Notice that essentially every client chip you can name ships with its full, native memory bus, regardless of other binning.  CPUs, yes.    But GPUs have been doing memory channel based market segmentation for decades.",Neutral
AMD,"On the website, it shows 3 versions, the last had 12 instead of 18 cores and 34 instead of 53MB cache.  The other two differ in clock speed and memory bandwidth. The bus width could be their way to put the SKUs in the desired performance brackets. Or they have something in their memory subsystem design that results in relatively low yields when going for full bandwidth.",Neutral
AMD,"Most likely they will still reach 4.6Ghz, last gen gen had tons of issues   Even the lowest X Elite SKU reaches 4.7Ghz in ST",Negative
AMD,"The M4 max is a larger chip with a much larger 512bit memory bus that is only cut down on one config, and cut down proportionally less vs X2 cutting it on all but one. That's not normal.",Negative
AMD,"Err, yes. Second one. Fixed now. Apparently I got my autocorrect to learn LPDDR5, but not LPDDR6 -_-",Neutral
AMD,"TL;DW - An OEM only CPU called the FX-4200 has four modules with four integer units, four floating point units, and access to all the cache. In synthetic FPU benchmarks, it dominates over the FX-4350. In gaming there isn't much a difference.",Neutral
AMD,Phenom 2 was pretty damn good and AMD might have held up better by doing a die shrink refresh of it rather than gambling on the weirdness of Bulldozer.  It might have saved them some desperately needed money too that could have been better invested in a good successor architecture. I'm fairly sure the only reason the shared fpu thing happened was to save die space and therefore money as AMD were up shit creek at the time financially.,Positive
AMD,"It's an interesting oddity, I had never heard of the FX-4200  2011-2013 was still so single-thread dominated I don't think this difference would have even registered to most, especially when Intel was still pulling off insane die shrinks that gave them 20% more performance for 20% less power  But these videos are also a reminder that FX series didn't age as badly as it benchmarked in those years, at least.",Neutral
AMD,That 40 seconds at the start of the conclusion felt like it 10 minutes long.,Neutral
AMD,"It seems like the high inter-module latency is hurting the 4200 in some cases which causes the 4350 to have better performance. I remember reading something from chips and cheese I think that showed the inter-module latency was somewhere over 300ns. I think this is also why Microsoft changed the scheduler behavior in Windows 8+. In windows 7, it loads the first core in each module first essentially treating it like a CPU with SMT. In windows 8 and newer the scheduler keeps threads on the same module if it thinks they have a lot of inter-core traffic.  I honestly don’t think the construction core design wouldn’t have been that bad if the L1 and L3 cache weren’t so poorly performing alongside the poor 32nm Global Foundries node. 28nm wasn’t much better either from Global Foundries. I would’ve liked to have seen a full blown desktop Steamroller and Excavator chip with 4 modules and L3 cache.  AMD learned a lot with these designs and carried over quite a bit into Ryzen.",Negative
AMD,Almost went for a fx 8350 back in the day before I even knew anything about their weirdness. Somehow ended up with a G3258 instead. Was so impressed with their clocks vs intel.,Positive
AMD,I had a 3 core i believe! Tried to enable the 4th but it wouldnt boot lol.,Neutral
AMD,"When I was hesitating to upgrade, ryzen was already put but I gave my PC one last hurrah by buying a used fx-9590 lol.

AMD,"I had an FX-57 in 2005. Played CoD, Eve Online and WoW on it for years. It was a beast!",Positive
AMD,"Wrong question, what if Intel didn't sabotage multiprocessor development.",Negative
AMD,Really curious where the 8 core variants compare to the 4c4m versions in the synthetic benchmarks as it would be 8 core for integer tasks but quad core in fpu tasks essentially  I know when I ran ESXi on my desktop FX-8120 it ran pretty good so long as I set the core preferences for each VM,Neutral
AMD,"Llano was technically a 32nm shrink of Phenom II, but with a rather big IGP slapped in. I recall than it had very poor frequency scaling due to having used a process to favour the GPU density over CPU clock speed, so it didn't left a good impression.",Negative
AMD,"From a marketing perspective too I think Bulldozer benefited too. A 4.2 GHz ""quad core"" FX-4350 sounds great for $122. Sort of like how 3 GHz Pentium 4 sounds better than a 2.2 GHz Athlon 64.",Positive
AMD,"It was also designed to hit 6ghz stock, where it would have easily beaten Phenom and all the design compromises would have made a ton of sense. The actual silicon ended up not coming close.   Edit: I'm not sure where I read/heard 6ghz specifically. However if we take the (very safe) assumption that they intended to beat Phenom's performance, and it was 33% narrower with the corresponding IPC loss, then the intended clock speed would need to be 40-50% higher.",Neutral
AMD,"Honestly there's a fairly straight line AMD could have taken to evolve the Stars cores into something akin to Zen (or just hold down the fort until Zen). Bulldozer was a tremendous waste of resources (during some lean years as well). Llano showed that even with a VERY light touch, it was trivial to squeeze another 5 to 10 percent more IPC out of Stars, even though the focus of that 32nm shrink was the iGPU. They could have bought a little time by making a Phenom III by slapping some L3 cache back on there and running 6 cores by default like Thuban. Then the next step would have been to widen things a bit and implement all the instructions they had fallen behind on. The next step would have been a uop cache and SMT and well.... you're looking at something mighty close to Zen1, assuming you could fab it on 28nm since 20 wasn't going to happen.",Negative
AMD,Wasn't bulldozer competing with sandy bridge at that time? It want even close.,Neutral
AMD,Thubans were great chips!,Positive
AMD,"Phenom II was good for the time (I had a 955BE), but I'm not sure how much farther they could have pushed the architecture. Once Intel released Sandy Bridge I don't think there was much AMD could have done at that point. It was such a huge leap that it served as the foundation for Intel for nearly a decade, with only minor tweaks. Even the original Ryzen barely matched it in IPC and certainly not in clock speed.",Neutral
AMD,Phenoms were a beast. I got my 955 BE almost to 4ghz. Ran that thing from 2009 to 2017 with an upgrade to ryzen.,Positive

Thought the FX was weird, the Phenom was great, but old, so I went with the i5. Best decision I have ever made in regards to hardware.",Negative
AMD,I was able to do it on a Gigabyte board,Neutral
AMD,"If memory serves correct, and I could be off, anandtech did a 4T / 4M test. FP perf per thread went up but was lower overall since 8T going to the what was, loosely speaking, a 4 FPUs with SMT had a performance uplift.   There was also ""typical"" scaling for INT workloads going from 4T / 4M to 8T / 4M in that it was ""close enough"" to 2x.",Neutral
AMD,"I'd forgotten about Llano. I didn't get my hand on an A series APU until the Steamroller A-10 generation. Even with the crappie bulldozer based cpu architecture that A-10 really impressed me with its GPU performance, it was a massive jump up from the Intel IGP despite still being far below discreet GPU performance and Intel CPU performance.",Positive
AMD,"I know the design goal of Pentium 4 was to get higher clock speeds (to which the laws of physics said no), but I've not heard of Bulldozer being the same.",Neutral
AMD,Bulldozer was crap. Nobody denies that.,Neutral
AMD,"same here, it's sad that they are so often equated to bulldozer chips.",Neutral
AMD,Phenom IIs were good but the Phenom64 was pretty mediocre for the level of hype it had. I had a 9950BE which was the fastest one they made IIRC and I couldn’t get it stable past 2.8Ghz with modest air cooling. I think quad cores weren’t exactly ready for prime time back then and a core 2 duo probably would have served me much better.  When I got a 955BE later on it performed much better,Negative
AMD,You hate your daughter that much? Lol,Neutral
AMD,2500k was the goat. Back when overclocking could actually give you major gains. The G3258 Actually won an overlooking competition with it on a Evo 212 lol.

Still got me a 5800x3d no reason to upgrade now. Missing being a broke kid finding the best deals,Positive
AMD,"Makes sense given the hardware constraints and the clock speed uplift would probably show a bit of performance improvement on FPU tasks.  I probably read that article, completely blanked on it, and then you reminded me and now I can't look at it because the site is more or less down now, which is a shame.",Neutral
AMD,multithreading getting close to 2x performance uplift? Man whatever test they used must be horrible at feeding the frontend. Under hypothetical ideal I/O feeding SMT has a performance downgrade from overhead.,Neutral
AMD,"The whole time I had it on air too, I wonder what I could squeeze out of it with my push pull 360 aio I have now. Got it to boot at like 4.1ghz but would crash if you tried to do anything. I'm surprised I didn't melt it.",Neutral

AMD,I didn't make the test or set up the OS or any of that.   With that said... it does say something about how software was set up back in the day and was janky.   I don't think anyone is out there saying that the FX series hit all design goals. There were definitely cases where a 6T/3M FX CPU was a better choice than a 2C/4T i3 but that was based on pricing not the CPU design... and Zen was a big enough step up that it exceeded my expectations.,Negative
AMD,"I was using an aio with it the entire time, the stock cooler i initially got with it was very noisy, I got them to send a new one, but by that time i was already using the aio; i believe i got it stable at 4.1 or 4.2 but I don't really remember right now; not sure if this was a factor but i had it paired with low-cas memory.",Neutral

Give it a fan and it'll perform better.   In the end whether it's fanless or not just depends on how many watts you want to feed it. The more watts the faster.  Phones are fanless due to the form factor. That's all. I am sure you know even phones benefit from active cooling, despite their tiny <15W chips.",Neutral
AMD,"There's no world where a fanless device will be considered perfomant if the same device exists but with even as little as a heatsink, the difference in performance and system stability is way more important to 99.9% of people than reducing the already non-existent ""noise"" from modern systems.

AMD,">It's a design decision. The X1 could also be fanless, but manufacturers chose to give it fans so they perform better.  Huge if ***Qualcomm*** designs an X2 SKU specifically for fanless operation. People ought to know most Windows laptop OEMs do not prioritize on battery life. Why? If they can beat another OEM by 1-2% in a heavy nT benchmark with more power, they will.   Windows OEMs are not in the business of offering ""slower"" devices—if Dell / HP / Lenovo can unlock a higher PL1 & PL2 (base / boost) power level, they will.   Of course if you *want* to consume 2x the power for usually something like 15% more perf, you have plenty of Windows laptops to choose from. A fanless device requires more restraint.  The primary way fanless CPUs launch is through SKUs that ***can't*** be unlocked and that is a *choice* by CPU firms: Intel, AMD, Apple, Qualcomm, MediaTek, etc.  Again, I'm not saying ***you*** need to be forced to buy a fanless laptop. I'd just like more designed-as-fanless choices.  You can turn *most any* PC fanless with a custom fan curve & PL1 / PL2 limits, but it's tricky, space inefficent, and not easy for normal consumers.   Fanless-by-***design*** laptops always work fanlessly without needing to download custom tools, allow more space for batteries, zero vents, less weight, guaranteed zero maintenance, etc.  //  This shouldn't be controversial.

AMD,">There's no world where a fanless device will be considered perfomant if the same device exists but with even as little as a heatsink, the difference in performance and system stability is way more important to 99.9% of people than reducing the already non-existent ""noise"" from modern systems.  Yet most consumers use their fanless MacBook Airs M1 / M2 / M3 / M4, their performance is quite fast and more than enough daily computing.   Claiming ""system stability"" is compromised on fanless SoCs is a little silly.   Apple's 4+4 fanless choice is great.   >A modern system will only be loud if you build it to be loud or put it in a situation where it needs to get loud, you already can go and config your system to turn off your fans and massively throttle your clocks and see how marvellous fanless is.  Again, plenty of consumers are not stressing their workloads to throttling on already-existing fanless laptops.  Sure, you can turn most any PC fanless with a custom fan curve & PL1 / PL2 limits, but it's tricky, space inefficent, and not easy for normal consumers.  Fanless-by-***design*** laptops always work fanlessly without needing to download custom tools, allow more space for batteries, zero vents, less weight, guaranteed zero maintenance, etc.",Neutral
AMD,Apple's E core designs are hard carrying them here despite the core count deficit.,Neutral
AMD,Looking at Geekerwan's review on Bilbili rn. Its pulling 19W on the MT side to acheive that.,Neutral
AMD,Yeah but the problem I see is the SVE2 is not part of the core and we are counting it as a part of core.,Negative
AMD,I think the real thing missing will be a premium fan less option cause the X2 is the lower chip and they reserve premium models for premium chips. But still if somebody can consider a design with the ever common 2800x1800 120hz OLEDs around and a haptic trackpad with a nice metal body it would be a solid choice.,Neutral
AMD,"All you're saying is ""make it worse/limit it on purpose"" so it can be fanless.  It doesn't matter if it was optimized to work better at low power (like AMD Zen c cores, or smartphone SOCs). Even smartphones, which are basically the peak of energy efficiency, still get faster if you feed them more power than they can cool continuously (phones do peak at like 15W power draw, but they can't sustain it passively).  If you give a chip more power, it will be faster. It's this simple.  It is a design decision, like I said.",Negative
AMD,X2 or 8 Elite Gen 5 is pulling 19W?,Neutral
AMD,"*Worse* for you. All CPUs are ""limited on purpose"" to fit inside a certain TDP. Do you think every Intel & AMD SKU allows unlimited TDP? No. They specifically create TDP-specific tiers to fit into every device form factor.  Fanless just calls for one more rung on the **lower** end of TDP, instead of the higher end of TDP.  The # of people clammoring for actively-cooled smartphones is nil. Most consumers love fanless devices ***when*** they are performant and efficient.   >It is a design decision, like I said.  This is simply explaining this choice is predominantly controlled by the CPU designer in the world of Windows laptops, which most folks don't understand.",Negative
AMD,The phone SOC. Yes.,Neutral
AMD,"Im impressed that Qualcomm hasn't made a good support for linux of their Elite lineup.    There isn't a lot of Linux people out there, but a lot of them would happily use an ARM laptop.    Im even thinking of buying that ARGON laptop that you use with a Pi5 just because it looked fun",Neutral
AMD,The X Elite 2 could be very interesting if Qualcomm gets full Linux support working at hardware release time by getting the major distributions installing on it out of the box. I reckon it would do wonders for their mind share having devs & enthusiast tech early adopters switch to it.  I'm not hopeful of them managing it though. Whoever is in charge of the X Elite program really screwed up the entire dev hardware release and outreach.,Positive
AMD,"> While there are some quirks in setting it up like keeping WoA installation for extracting the necessary firmware  Yeah you can call that a ""quirk"" for sure.",Neutral
AMD,"Yea, linux is the only relatively popular OS family where transition to ARM would be painless. Yet here we are.",Neutral
AMD,"Why would Qualcomm, a company thats all about locking their clients into proprietary walled gardens, want to support linux?",Negative
AMD,>The X Elite 2 could be very interesting if Qualcomm gets full Linux support working at hardware release time by getting the major distributions installing on it out of the box.  This is very unlikely to happen. Qualcomm is not that kind of company.,Neutral

AMD,i mean best bang for buck is like the 9600x  7800x3d is if you want a top of the line chip without being wasteful pretty much,Positive
AMD,Wanna laugh? I am rocking a 1080Ti with a 7800x3D with 32gb DDR 5 ram.,Neutral
AMD,"It never was. It was the best, but never the best «bang for the buck» because it was always expensive.  The 7500f, 7600x, 7700, 7700x, 9600x and 9700x are bang for the buck processors.",Negative
AMD,"It depends on your budget. If we're talking about a 1500 to 2000 bucks PC, then yes. But just from a price/performance optimized build, no.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah it's pretty good value, 2nd fastest chip for ~350. 9800X3D is the only thing better, but assuming a 1440p or higher resolution only pairing with a 5090 would make any difference, and then only really at 1440p.",Positive
AMD,"The X3D versions are great processors if you pair them with a high-end GPU or are doing tasks that particularly take advantage of the high amount of on-CPU cache. But they aren't a magic bullet. If you're framerate limited by your GPU, for example using a 5070 at 4k, the CPU won't make a big difference. But, that being said, if you can find a good price on one, it's not going to be a bad purchase. It's going to be at least as good as the regular version, if not better.  The real choice comes down to comparing the price of the X3D CPU versus a non-X3D, and your budget. For example, a 9900X is often around the same price as a 7800X3D (it was down to $355 recently, don't know what it is right now), and performs much better in a lot of workloads. Or, spending less on the CPU could allow you to get a better GPU for the same budget, resulting in better FPS per dollar.  Since it seems like you don't upgrade very often, which is good, don't worry about future proofing or the platform so much. If Intel wasn't in so much disarray, I'd still be recommending (and buying) the 14600k as the bang-for-the-buck king. In general, get what's going to meet your needs now and provide the best value within your budget.",Positive
AMD,"The 7800x3D is still an expensive CPU, good bang for the buck if your looking for topmof the line performance. But the 14600k is the true bang for the buck CPU right now for gaming and productivity. No upgrade path, but itll last years anyway.",Positive
AMD,"None of AM5 x3d chips are good value for money performance wise (7500F, tray 7700, 9600x, 14600k are all much better value for performance they offer). They’re fastest CPUs for gaming though.",Positive
AMD,Yes get the 7800X3D,Neutral
AMD,If you can get a deal from microcenter it's absolutely one of the best price to performance CPUs you can get.  if not it's definitely a bit up there.,Positive
AMD,"It would be a great choice, though not all that cheap.  What is your budget looking like? If you'd have to skimp on the GPU to get the 7800X3D, I'd get a non X3D chip instead, even down to the 7600X, so you can shift some money to the GPU budget. You'll still be on AM5 allowing for upgrades for at least this and the next generation, and have better performance in the short term.",Positive
AMD,I recently got it for 385 before tax,Neutral
AMD,How well does my 5800x3D hold up?,Neutral
AMD,I'd say it's the OEM version of Ryzen 7700 because it's very cheap and holds its own against high end CPUs in many things. A great allrounder.,Positive
AMD,"Yes..but there is an argument for 9800x3d too, as you will delay the inevitable upgrade for longer.",Neutral
AMD,"If it's for gaming, I think the 7600x3d is also great value if you have access to a microcenter for the bundles",Positive
AMD,This is like a cheap fiat vs a Lambo. The difference is substancial and this comes from someone who upgraded from a I9 9900k to a 9800x3d.,Neutral

AMD,"I agree, and to be more specific, the Intel 14600k is the best bang for the buck if you're okay buying into a dead end platform and just want performance right now.  9600x is the best bang for buck on AM5 and gives you a lot of room to upgrade.",Positive

AMD,"Yeah I should have been more specific in the post. 1500-2000 is around the budget im looking at for hardware (reusing case and coolers, at least temporarily).  Specific to the bang for buck, I should have clarified that im wanting a highish performance build capable of running games like cyberpunk at ultra or high settings.",Neutral

AMD,It's rarely worth wasting $200 to upgrade later. Even if he sells it and loses like 50,Negative
AMD,How would a 9600x compare to a i7- 4790k?,Neutral
AMD,60-90 fps on medium mostly high settings on all games on 1440p.. Except very few games like Alan Wake 2. Make sure you change thermal paste and adds thermal pads. Changed it recently from 84c on load to 45-60c.,Neutral
AMD,"for the 7800x3d its helping pushing some open-world games or big maps games like Hell Let Loose (fps increase and makes it smooth) however, it's bottleneck for sure because of the 1080Ti.",Neutral
AMD,"Based on those requirements, the 7800x3d is a great option at current prices, then spend as much as you can on the gpu.   You can prob squeeze a 5080 in there if you're in the US.",Positive
AMD,"only online competitive games benefit from 7800x3d chips, but since you're on a very good budget. Go for it, should cover you for the next 5-7 years",Positive
AMD,"I just picked up an 7800x3d paired with a 5080, and it's phenomenal at Cyberpunk.    If you can afford a 7800x3d, it'll be a good investment for the future, as you seem to keep your gear for a lifetime generations.",Positive
AMD,easily 4-5 imo unless gpus have a breakthrough in the next couple generations,Neutral
AMD,"I don't see it as a waste, but your take is valid too. I'm trying to do a similar upgrade going from a 6700k, just waiting for Zen6 to drop. And in the meantime save some money for their top tier x3D chip. If they redesign the chips similarly to what they did to Strix Halo, we may get some real nice performance uplift.",Neutral
AMD,"insane, probably like 3x as fast",Positive
AMD,"You'll be asking yourself ""Why didn't I do this upgrade sooner?"".   A 10 year newer CPU... is fast.",Positive
AMD,I went from a 4790k to a 5800x to a 9700x. It's a staggering improvement. Remember that one doesn't keep everything else the same tho. I went from 1080 60hz to 1440 240hz.  The smoothness of 60-80 1% lows and avg of 100-140 is pretty nice.,Positive
AMD,I went from a heavily overlocked i7 5930k to a 5900x in 2021 and it was a massive improvement all around. Already replaced that with a 9800x3D which was a massive improvement in games though not as noticeable in other general use.,Positive
AMD,"For those games, unless they're gaming at 1080p, they're probably better off with a 9700x or 265k.",Neutral
AMD,Music to my ears.,Neutral
AMD,"Rumor mill is saying AMD is targeting 7GHz for Zen 6.   Strix Halo update will be a bit later, those aren't drop in chips, they are for motherboards manufacturers and laptop manufacturers. So you won't be upgrading the CPU to them, afaik.",Neutral
AMD,"You do you, but what gpu are you even using? Just buy a 9800x3d now which pretty much maxes out a 5090, then if the new chip is really that much better (doubtful) just sell that instead of selling the 9600x. If you have the money for a 5090, why are you so worried about $200 (and if you don't a 9800x3d is plenty)?",Neutral
AMD,If he can afford a 7800x3d/5080 there is no benefit to go lower.,Neutral
AMD,"It's even quite likely, that it will be good enough for most games for even longer than that. The games that benefit the most from the X3D CPUs are CPU intensive games (strategy games, MMOs, competetive games at 1080p). If you play AAA games or Story games mostly, you will not be bottlenecked for a loooooong time.",Positive
AMD,"I'm thinking more in the sense that Zen6 may drop infinity fabric and use the redesigned interconnector they did with Strix Halo. Something about better core to core latency. However I am no expert on that, and don't claim to be.  Theres a video on the AMD subreddit from someone really knowledgeable on computer science going over the schematics of the chips and how its a preview of what can potentially come to the new mainstream chips. I highly recommend it, its quite interesting. Of course until theres benchmarks, its all speculation.",Neutral
AMD,"Right now a 6950XT thats severely underutilized but I got it for like ~$400 a couple years ago if I remember correctly. I would be able to buy a 5090 if I really wanted to as well, but I had to spend quite a bit of my fun money savings this year for some important things. So I'll probably wait until next year to before I do the new build. Were it not for that I probably would have gone 9800x3D already.  I think going back to your initial point of it rarely being worth it, I considered going top of the line CPU and GPU until I had to divert that money elsewhere. Thats why I briefly was thinking of getting the AM5 set up with something more suited for my 6950XT. Seemed tempting, and I think I would have done it if I was more impulsive. Heres to hoping next gen CPUs bring a substantial increase in performance.",Neutral
AMD,Sure there is — more money for other things.,Neutral
AMD,"I do play some single player games, bit of COD here and there (although the last few ones suck), but I mostly play flight sim. I will upgrade in a few years though, so I guess I'm good",Neutral
AMD,"So, that may be the case. The difference between the Serdes and the point to point is better, I just don't know right now is that is implemented for the AM5 platform. The reality it, I am not sure you will get much benefit from that is it is just used to connect the memory controller where Strix Halo uses it to connect the GPU, which is a bit different.  It would be nice, though.",Neutral
AMD,Lower memory latency won't help x3d chips that much and 8 cores is enough for now. It's probably for llms,Negative
AMD,"The 9000s were basically no gain, so doubtful, at least for gaming. Maybe if they add more 3d vcache.   The cashflow thing makes more sense vs waiting for a cpu that either won't be a big gain or else you won't have the gpu to utilize it. But a 7800x3d isn't that much more than a 7600.",Negative
AMD,That suggests they can't afford it lol,Neutral
AMD,"Certainly would be nice, since I'm hoping to keep this AM5 build for a long long time.",Positive
AMD,"Just because someone can afford it, doesn't mean they should spend that money. I can go and buy a $75,000 car tomorrow -- doesn't mean I need it or I should spend that money.  By getting the cheaper CPU, they could spend the money on a few games and get way more enjoyment out of that money. They won't notice a difference between the CPUs while playing",Negative
AMD,Yes 850W is enough unless you plan do some insane overclocking.,Negative
AMD,850W unit of good quality does it. I suggest an ATX 3 unit with native 12v2x6 cable.,Positive
AMD,"850w good one or 1000W if you want more free ""space""",Positive
AMD,850 watts is plenty. RTX 5080 uses around 350 at peak.,Neutral
AMD,"I have the same exact setup with corsair 850w psu. Works great.    I usually game in 4k cs2, farm sim, satisfactory etc. And gpu load is around 250-300W with OC. And CPU around 60-80W. Peaks can be higher.",Positive
AMD,"If you're in the US, Montech Century II 1050W is only $20 more than the 850W variant. Good value A-tier PSU. It's not needed, but it's nice to have for $20.",Positive
AMD,I got 1000W for futureproof. I’ll just change out the gpu for something newer in the far future. Hopefully by then gpus won’t need more than 1000W system lol,Positive
AMD,"850W is plenty, just get a quality power supply.",Neutral
AMD,"I use same cpu with 5090 with 850w MSI 3.1 PSU, works great. So yeah, with a 5080 you're okay with 850w",Positive
AMD,Yeah won't be doing insane overclocking on it. I'll be sticking with the 850 then,Neutral
AMD,You'd really need to do crazy insane OC to run into problems with 9800x3d/5080 on 850w lol,Negative
AMD,I'm picking the **Corsair RM850x (2024) 850 W Fully Modular ATX Power Supply.** Will this suffice?,Neutral
AMD,Hmm yeah the 850 seems to be more than enough for what i'll use then,Positive
AMD,Yes. Great unit.,Positive
AMD,"B850 motherboards are effectively rebadged B650 motherboards where the primary M.2 slot is *required* to support PCIe 5.0 instead of just PCIe 4.0, but many B650 motherboards did anyway. Most B850 motherboards also generally support PCIe 5.0 for the main PCIe slot, though it is not required and some do not. A small number of B650 motherboards did support PCIe 5.0 for the main PCIe x16 slot, but this was much rarer.  For a gaming on a 5070, this will have no performance impact either way. The RTX 5090 sees a 2\~3% performance difference in two games, and the rest have no meaningful difference between PCIe 4.0 and 5.0. Even PCIe 3.0 only sees a maybe 1-2% performance loss. 8 GB GPUs when running games using settings that require more than 8GB of VRAM generally see massive performance losses regardless of if you're using PCIe 4.0 or PCIe 5.0, though it's *less* when using PCIe 5.0, it's still usually significant enough that you're better off just not running those quality settings to begin with, or buying a better GPU. There's effectively no measurable difference between PCIe 4.0 and PCIe 5.0 with any other PCIe 5.0 capable GPU. It took nearly a decade after PCIe 4.0 became standard that we started to be even able to measure a difference. I suspect it'll be about that long before PCIe 5.0 becomes relevant as well.  Similarly, PCIe 5.0 for the SSD has no meaningful benefit for gaming. A small handful of games see tiny fractions of a second faster load times vs a PCIe 4.0, or even a decent PCIe 3.0 SSD. It's not worth even looking at.  The last thing some B850 motherboards have that few B650 motherboards have is WiFi 7 instead of WiFi 6E. WiFi 7 is legitimately faster ... for short range line of sight between WiFi 7 devices. Otherwise WiFi 6E and WiFi 7 are basically the same.  The MSI Tomahawk motherboards are well liked by a lot of people due to generally having a lot of USB ports on the rear I/O, as well as black styling.  The B850 Gaming Plus Wifi and Pro B860-P Wifi are almost literally the same motherboard with different screen printing on the PCB and slightly different shaped heat sinks. They also swap between having an HDMI or DP on the rear I/O, and the Gaming Plus has an ""EZ-Conn"" header for use with some proprietary MSI fans. The Pro motherboard also has the pads for this connector, there's just no header soldered to it, because *it's the same motherboard*.  You can also get an Asus TUF GAMING B650-PLUS WIFI or Gigabyte B650 Gaming X AX V2 which apart from the lack of PCIe 5.0 on the x16 slot, and are using WiFi 6E aren't much different.  Asrock motherboards have been excellent options for their price, but they've been having some weird issues lately, especially with X3D CPUs, so it might be best to avoid them for now.",Neutral
AMD,"7800X3D doesn't consume much power, so basically any AM5 board will be able to run it, as long as you don't want to overclock memory too much (something that you don't really need to do with an X3D chip anyway).  Features - that depends on what you need. I needed optical audio out, so I was limited with my choice. If you don't need WiFi you can get a cheaper MB that doesn't have WiFi, etc.  -  The MSI MAG B650 is the most high-end board here, if you theoretically want to upgrade to a CPU with higher power consumption ~3-4 years down the line.",Neutral
AMD,Maybe just not Asrock if you plan on upgrading down the line with a 9800x3d. I love Asrock but just not this gen.,Negative

AMD,"Most of my experience over the past decade is with MSI boards. I have both the B650 and B850 Tomahawks.  Either is fine, especially if Wi-Fi is not a big determining factor. The B650 comes with the AMD branded WiFi card, which is not great, but can get the job done. I swapped mine out for an Intel card immediately. The 850 comes with a Qualcomm card, which is fine. The 850 does have a bug with the LAN port. Some things such as unplugging the cable while is use will cause the port to vanish entirely. Restarting the computer or trying to reinstall drivers won't fix it. You have to do a full power cut. Shut it down., physically remove power from it and hold the power button for about 30 seconds. Then restart it and the port is back like nothing happened. So far I've only run into the issue once so it's not a major issue unless you don't know how to resolve it.",Neutral
AMD,The awesomeness of your response deserves more attention.,Neutral
AMD,"Wow, thanks for such a detailed breakdown! That clears up a lot of the confusion I had between B650 and B850 boards, especially about PCIe 5.0 basically not mattering for gaming right now. Good to know about the WiFi 7 difference too, and the Tomahawk USB ports are definitely appealing.

AMD,"Good to hear your experience has been solid with the 7800X3D on that board! Yeah, I’ve also seen those posts about 9800X3D issues with ASRock, so it’s reassuring to know the 7800X3D doesn’t seem to be affected in the same way. Thanks for sharing!",Positive
AMD,"That does look like a solid board, and the price is really tempting. Someone else mentioned they had a bad experience with Gigabyte in the past, but from what I’ve seen the B850 Gaming X looks pretty solid on paper. Definitely one I’ll keep in mind, thanks!",Positive
AMD,"Thanks for sharing your experience! That’s really useful to know about the WiFi differences between the B650 and B850, and also the LAN bug on the B850. I’ll probably be using Ethernet most of the time, so it shouldn’t be a big issue for me, but it’s good to know there’s a way to fix it if it does happen.

I was thinking about whole system replacement but that's the time Intel CPU are having lots of problems and I am not familiar with AMD builds. Therefore instead of replacement, I upgraded my GPU to **RTX 4070**, a lot of people might disagree with my choice (CPU bottleneck) but it turn out completely fine for me and I am happy about it. After GPU upgrades, all my games run smoothly with high graphic settings.  This year I want to run something like multiple VMs but restricted by 16GB RAM. I tried to add Corsair 16GB more but caused mismatch between new and old RAM. So I returned Corsair 16GB and ordered Kingston DDR4 (4x16GB) **64GB** and replaced the old RAMs. Also replaced all chassis fans and CPU cooler.  Current performance fulfilled all my requirement, I don't need to upgrade in a few years. All upgrades cost me about 800$ in total.

AMD,Be Quiet! Black Rock Pro 5 keeps my 9800x3d at 45°C consistently.,Neutral
AMD,I’ve got NH-C14S. Could have gone the smaller NH-U9S.,Neutral
AMD,You can easly undervolt the 9800x3d. I did and I runs less cooler(17C less). Yiu can handle it with air cooler without issues.,Neutral
AMD,"As people have pointed out, most coolers can cool the thing at stock settings. However, I use an ITX cooler for esthetic reasons, and all I had to do was adjust the TDP by a few tens of watts in BIOS, and now my PC is whisper quiet even with underpowered cooling.",Neutral
AMD,"Note that Thermalright releases new tiny bit better coolers all the time so a Royal Knight, Peerless Assasin (V3?), Royal Pretor etc, all should be a bit better at similar pricepoints. The last one might be more expensive.",Neutral
AMD,Even single tower coolers are rated for like 150w,Neutral
AMD,"NH-D15 G2 LBC in particular for an AMD system, but only if you plan to stay with AMD for the life of the cooler (or *really* don’t care about cost). LBC is designed specially for AMD systems, HBC for Intel, and then there’s the jack-of-all-trades base model.",Neutral
AMD,The Phantom Spirit is slightly better than the Peerless Assassin due to having an extra heatpipe.  The Royal Knight is offset and has a slim side fan to not cover the RAM but still has the same number of heatpipes as the Peerless Assassin.  That slim side fan probably slightly reduces its performance though.  Not sure about the Royal Pretor.,Neutral
AMD,I wouldn't trust that at sustained loads though. I have a 260w dual with a 180w cpu. During gaming it's fine and barely hits 60⁰ while 40-50 utilization. Productivity and hitting all cores that gets near saturation,Neutral
AMD,"""Rated for"" and 'actually capable of cooling efficiently' are not the same thing. Cooler TDP ratings are entirely made up bullshit and should never be used.  Single-tower coolers are good for <80W CPUs like the 5600 / 9600X etc. Beyond that, you should be looking at thicker single-towers or dual-towers. As always, reviews and benchmarks are your friend.",Negative
AMD,I have this specific cooler (180€) for 7800x3d and it’s hella cool but my girlfriends 40€ cooler has the exact same noise and temperature… silicone lottery is worth more is my takeaway,Positive

AMD,"It was better than V1 of peerless assassin, I think is still better than v2, I don't know about V3.",Positive
AMD,It’s a shame that nobody (to my knowledge) sells binned CPUs for overclocking anymore – not even Thermal Grizzly and their delidded CPUs.,Negative
AMD,"Yeah, that means it has a BIOS that's new enough to support the CPU.",Neutral
AMD,"It will work, but you can still do the update to have the latest AGESA etc. Depending on the BIOS date, you could have one of the first 9000-series compatible BIOS versions, and those weren't too stable.",Neutral
AMD,"Should work, but I'd still recommend seeing if you can get an update for it",Positive
AMD,"It should work just fine, probably should upgrade bios anyway after.",Positive
AMD,"Yes it should have already been updated, but if the board is released before the ryzen 9000 series then the bios version would be the second thing to check if it doesnt boot (after checking everything is seated and connected correctly).",Neutral
AMD,By definition it means the motherboard will work with the first generation of 9000 series CPUs as is.  The 9600x is a first generation 9000 series CPU.,Neutral
AMD,I had box with this label but it didn't work with 9950x until I updated bios,Neutral
AMD,Always update the BIOS to the latest version. If your BIOS gets compromised your computer is fucked.,Neutral
AMD,It will work and you should still update to the latest known stable bios,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, definitely update. It's a healthy habit to make sure everything is updated. And use UPS system in case of power loss during update.",Positive
AMD,Your 9600X will work. A BIOS update is recommended (mandatory) for stability.,Neutral
AMD,I updated the bios anyway. Just for precaution through a usb as I haven’t assembled the pc yet,Neutral
AMD,"Well not always,when you update stuff SOMETHING usually breaks or stops working correctly",Neutral
AMD,"It's the same as me. Every PC I assemble always gets the latest BIOS possible, since there is a lot of fixes and compatibility improvement now, both on Intel and AMD side. Both companies had problems with CPUs burning themselves due to too high default voltages in first BIOS releases (7800X3D, 9800X3D, 13-14th gen Intels etc.).  So always latest BIOS plus I keep with the news and if there is a critical flaw fixed, I let my clients know that they will need an update, just for the peace of mind :)",Neutral
AMD,the b650. save $110,Neutral

AMD,B650. You’ll probably not see a difference at all between the two.,Neutral
AMD,Both are really good motherboards but if its a $110 gap this is one of those times is ok to cheap out on the motherboard. For the msot part they are nearly identical and the B650 version definitely punches above its wieght class.   Id go B650,Positive
AMD,"Yep, and skip on the 7800X3D and put the money saved towards a 5070 Ti instead. People are too obsessed with the X3D chips that offer poor value for money when most of the time they are going to be GPU limited.",Negative
AMD,"Thanks! What kind of CPU would you recommend, something like the 9700x?",Positive
AMD,That would be fine. Any modern CPU from the last few years will be capable of pumping out high framerates.,Positive
AMD,"Alright, thank you!",Positive
AMD,"U can, that case is cheap for a reason  im not sure what ur budget is for new fans but u could also set a fan curve in bios to slow them down a little and hopefully reduce noise",Neutral
AMD,"The case is a hotbox  You don't need an x870 mobo, B850 would do the same thing",Neutral
AMD,"Besides the case (which seems to have lower air flow), The PC is really good. You could save money on some components which are overkill (like PSU, motherboard, SSD, air cooler would be enough) and put these money into a better GPU for example.",Positive
AMD,"The motherboard and power supply are overpowered for that system. If you can return them i would and get a b850 motherboard and a 850W good power supply.   From the money you save i would try to get a better graphics card. The one you have is gonna be alright.. ofc it depends on the resolution you play at,  but if you can get a better one for the same budget why not try.  And no, this year AMD made pretty good cards so you don't have to worry about amd being bad  If you can't return it's not the end of the world you just overspent a bit on some stuff but you could use them later when you upgrade the system",Neutral
AMD,"1000W power supply seems to big, 850 would have been fine.  You also went overboard on the mobo, a B850 is even maybe overkill, a B650 would have been fine.  Not a big deal, just could have saved a bit there.",Negative
AMD,You made an unforgiveable mistake by switching to the forbidden fruit (which is not to be named)!,Neutral
AMD,Why pay for all them pci5.0 lanes and opt for a 4.0 ssd. I would go up on that,Negative
AMD,"Id have gone with a different case, and an nvidia gpu. AMD drivers arent even close to as good as nvidias. Im sure it will work fine though. just keep an eye on your temps.",Neutral
AMD,What are the differences? Is it worth me getting a B850 over a B650?,Neutral
AMD,Thanks,Positive
AMD,I agree. The great thing about building PCs though is if you have some overpowered things like that you just future proof it for upgrades later 😆,Positive

AMD,"Oh I'm still on my am4 build for a while. I have an sn850. But since you're starting fresh, might as well get the most out of your hardware. Otherwise get a cheaper am5 that has only 4.0 m.2, maybe one 5.0 slot for the future, to save some cash",Neutral
AMD,"I went with the 9700X over the 7800X3D and 9800X3D after lots of debating.   Has exceeded my expectations, with no buyers remorse whatsoever.",Positive
AMD,"Hardware Unboxed has a fantastic video with CPU scaling testing. tl;dr even with a 5080, in 1440p the difference between 9700X and 9800X3D is rather small.   Certainly not worth that price hike.",Positive
AMD,Any 7000/9000 series is acceptable for this setup and use case IMO. 9800X3D could be useful if you play on low settings and/or CPU intensive games. To get a full picture what are the prices for:  7500F  7600  7600X  9600X  7700  7700X  9700X  7600X3D  7800X3D  9800X3D,Positive
AMD,"9800x3d also helps with the low 1% and I think that is necessary even at 1440p since I care more about lows rather than avg fps. If you can afford it, I would say go for the 9800x3d.",Positive
AMD,"See people building 9800X3D systems when they should be spending more on the GPU and less on the CPU.  It's fine for high end video cards at lower resolutions, but not as necessary with slower cards or at higher resolutions, but people get caught up in herd mentality and everyone now wants AMD.  Fact is a 265K bundle from microcenter is a good value and perfectly fine for gaming at high resolutions.",Neutral
AMD,"The 9700x is more than enough, no need to drop $500 for a 9800x3d.  The difference at stake is minimal.",Neutral
AMD,"Нема сенсу витрачати стільки грошей на 9800X3D, особливо якщо граєте у сінглплеєрні ігри. У мене самого Ryzen 7 7700 + RTX 4080 Super, що по характеристикам майже як 9700Х + 5070TI. І моя відеокарта завжди завантажена на 100% у всіх сучасних іграх (у 1440р).",Neutral

AMD,">I practically don't play online games at all.  You buy the 9800X3D because it performs better at unoptimized ""PvP"" oriented games (of all shorts), which obviously having 150 FPS with drops to 100, is better than 120 FPS with drops to 60.  For singe player games and not having the delusion that you lost because of the FPS difference, 9700X, 9600X, 13700, 14700 are all perfectly capable for the next 4-5 years.",Neutral
AMD,"Not worth it at all, the price difference is too big, and 9700X is more than enough since you are mostly playing single player game, X3D have more use in cpu intensive online game like Path of Exile/CS2, there isnt much opportunity for you to utilize it in single player game, except maybe Total War or such that need lots of computing for units",Negative
AMD,"For that much of price difference, 9700X is much better value. Where I live, which is South Korea, 9700X is around $250 while 9800X3D is around $380, so it makes sense to go for 9800X3D if you're a heavy gamer.",Positive
AMD,"I literally have tons of iterations of gaming benches for both of these chips.

You won't feel the difference unless you have telemetry up to show numbers are a bit different.  1% lows on 9700x is lower than even OC'd 7800x3d, but you won't be able to tell.  You're not aiming for top end components, there's no need to spend extra 250.  It is not worth that much more",Neutral
AMD,"Get a 9800X3D only if you have a 5090. This is how good this CPU is.  I've got a 9700X with a 9070XT, gaming on 1440p, and it's already too much, I could easily have gone with a 9600X",Positive
AMD,"IIRC Spider-Man is quite heavy on CPU so 9800X3D may have some edge in reaching 120fps for this game. GOW is a cross gen game so it has to be super optimized for CPU. Doom is also super optimized for CPU  If reaching 120fps is your top goal, you can always try to strike it with with a lower actual rendering resolution and DLSS so my way of thought is always only considering the raw performance of the CPU",Neutral
AMD,"I think most of your games are just GPU heavy, my pick would be 7600/7600x/9600x. These will be the best price-for-performance and 6 core cpus are pretty capable cpu.  I personally don't even consider 9700x a decent upgrade,you are paying almost 2x or two times of what you pay with 6 core cpus + performance gains are very slim and not worth the extra premium. I have 7600, if i was to choose higher cpus then it would have been 7800x3D(this is pretty good value currently, in most regions) or 9800x3D. But again, i don't need it.  9700x = 290,  7500f/7600/7600x/9600x = 150-180(save 100 bucks or buy extra storage)  A video of [hardware unboxed](https://youtu.be/gpN4nyftQ3M?si=myBvrpSdJe8udNZ8).",Neutral
AMD,If you're playing single player go for 9700x. X3ds are only worth the premium IF you care about *competitive* performance,Neutral
AMD,I would even go for the 9600x instead,Neutral
AMD,"For a gaming computer that X3D is really nice. However, the $250 gap between the 9700X and 9800X3D is a lot. I would strongly recommend looking at what a 7800X3D costs in your area. In the US it usually works out to roughly $50 more. The generational gain of the 9800X3D vs the 7800X3D isn't all that much. The X3D chips are also well known to have significantly better 1% lows and more consistent framerates. Sudden frame rate drops can be quite noticeable.

The 7800X3D is the 2nd best CPU on the market for gaming. It is the best bang for your buck if you can get one. Hence why you saw a lot of 7800X3D builds even after the 9800X3D came out.  Don't forget that a lot of modern games utilize upscaling so you'll probably be running your games at 1080p internally.  I'm kind of shocked so many people are saying to get the 9700X when the 7800X3D is still available. The 7600X3D would be a great deal too, but there's no way you can get that in Ukraine. It is microcenter exclusive.",Positive
AMD,Since you said no online gaming the 9700x. If you plan on online gaming the 9800x3d.,Neutral
AMD,https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d/19.html   Look at the charts. 9800x3d is typically around 8% faster than 9700x in 1440p,Positive
AMD,A buddy is helping me build a PC specifically for Battlefield 6. I originally started with the 9700X but ended up switching to the 9800X3D specifically because of how CPU intense BF 6 will be.,Positive
AMD,if you plan on playing escape tarkov go with a x3d cpu,Neutral
AMD,Honestly if u are looking to save some money id get a 7700x if its cheaper. The difference is almost nothing when compared to a 9700x.   Now if u are looking for top tier high refresh rate gaming then maybe consider the 9800x3d as it is great for those with high refresh rate monitors,Positive
AMD,"If you're only gaming on your PC then a Ryzen 5 5600 would be fine, and they only cost ~£55.  Lots of people buy the best CPUs because they're the fastest, but find that they don't really need all that power for their use case.

AMD,"Go ahead with the 9800x3d, its worth.",Neutral
AMD,"The Problem most people tend to forget is upscaling. If you use DLLS quality your gpu renders the image at below 1080p. Due to that you can run very easily into a gpu bottleneck . PC Games Hardware hast a good chart for that which is also way more balanced than HUB video. In CPU intensive games like Battlefield, Baldurs Gate 3 and so on a 9700x can and will bottleneck a 5070 and upwards. You should look at the 7800x3d imo in most region only a 50$ difference .

Here's how they compare when completely CPU bound (720p with a 4090):  https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d/17.html  At 1440p the difference will be lower, here's 1440p Ultra with a 4090:  https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d/19.html  But if you lower settings and enable DLSS at 1440p the difference will grow again",Neutral
AMD,"I just got a 9600x for $193, not on sale or anything",Neutral
AMD,"Wow it’s amazing, but 5090 in my region = 2500$… :(",Positive
AMD,I watched some video and I found Spiderman 2 is so heavy that 9800X3D may also drop below 60 when maxed out and 9700x will probably drop harder. Switching to a more reasonable setting is probably a good idea but 120fps might be just very difficult to reach for any CPU,Negative
AMD,"It's only a 40 dollhair difference here, that's why I asked. Is the difference bigger in Murica?",Neutral
AMD,If your playing at 1080p at low settings then it makes a noticeable difference. If youre playing 1080 with everything maxed out or at higher resolutions youre more GPU bound and it makes like 5-10% difference at most. The 12 core ryzen 9 would make the whole PC feel more responsive in comparison,Neutral
AMD,"Here in the EU it was around 3000€>  Since September, the FE has been in stock on Nvidia 's official store for 2100€ (basically MSRP)  Bought it immediately.",Neutral
AMD,"In US the price difference is like 150 USD, which is more inline with official pricing.  I also went with a 9700X. At 1440p and a mid range GPU, there's little benefit to a 98000X3D. I was actually going to do 9900X, which is still much less than 9800X3D, and way better at most production tasks, but I found a 9700X deal.",Neutral
AMD,Makes sense. Thanks for sharing!,Positive
AMD,"Lol 5500/4090 is a wild combo. If you don’t want to switch sockets, try to find a used 5700X3D or 5800X3D.",Neutral
AMD,"That might be the craziest GPU/CPU combo I have seen.  As far as AM4 CPUs go, that is the fastest one you can get for gaming and should keep up with the 4090 in just about any game out in 1440p and above.  Depending on how much the 5800x3d costs, it may be a better option to look into AM5 CPUs that would have more longevity. You would need a new board and RAM but generally it is better value to move to AM5 instead of spending $250+ on a good AM4 x3d CPU right now.",Positive
AMD,Get AM5 honestly,Neutral
AMD,"The 5800X3D was discontinued like a year ago.  There is also the 5700X3D, but it was discontinued about a month ago.  See if you can find either of them used for a decent price.",Neutral
AMD,"A 5**6**00 or 5600X is already about a 15% performance lift over the 5500.  A 5800X3D is about 60% faster than the 5500, but is *insanely* priced at the moment, going for nearly $700. The easier to find 5700X3D is 50% faster than the 5500, but still goes for $350 retail at the moment. Though you can find it for around $260 used on eBay.  For around $430 you can get a 7600X, decent B650 motherboard, 32GB of DDR5 6000 CL30, and a cooler which is roughly on par with the 5700X3D, and with another $20 more the 9600X roughly matches the 5800X3D.  [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/CrhWpK](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/CrhWpK)  You can also get a used 7500F off of eBay for around $130, bringing the total cost down below $400. If you can fit an ATX motherboard in your case, the Gigabyte B650 Gaming X AX is also $129 right now, cutting another $20 off that price. Meaning you'd be looking at around $370 for a full AM5 swap with performance roughly on par with the 5700X3D.  I should note the 7500F is only *slightly* slower than the 7600X. Not the same extreme difference as the 5500 and 5600X. The Ryzen 5 5500 is AMD's mobile version of the Zen 3 CPU with the iGPU fused off, where as the 5600 and higher are the desktop Zen 3 with significantly more cache and higher clock speeds. The Ryzen 5 7500F is a 7600 with the iGPU fused off and 100Mhz lower clock speed.",Neutral
AMD,"it would be a nice boost .. if your motherboard supports it, id be sure, and id also check if the board supports pcie4. if it doesnt id probably just get an budget am5 setup cpu/board/ram, and even a budget am5 will outperform a x3d on a 450 board ..",Positive
AMD,"I bought my step-daughter a prebuilt 5500 with a 3060 two years ago. Her father stole money she had been saving for a gaming pc. At that time, that was all I could swing. I’ve since replaced the 5500 with a 5800X3D and swapped out the 3060 with a 7800XT. It is like a completely different machine. But honestly, with prices where they are on the 5800x3d I would just put in a AM5 board and a 7800x3d.",Neutral
AMD,"5700x3d/5800x3d roughly matches 7500f/7600 performance levels. Unfortunately, I dont see those AM4 chips under $260-$300 used very much while the 7500f can be had for as little as $160 on Aliexpress. At this point, I would go straight to AM5 instead of upgrading AM4. Throw in about $100 for an mATX motherboard and $80 for 32gb DDR5, finally sell your old cpu/mobo/RAM for about $120 and honestly you may come out ahead on a current platform with faster memory.",Negative
AMD,"it makes no sense to buy a 5X00x3d anymore since you're gonna pay $300 minimum and it is probably preowned. at that point another $100-200 gives you an am5 mobo/ddr5/cpu.  also, with a 4090 you're not playing at 1080p like the cpu-bound benchmark videos.  just get a $160 ryzen 5800xt instead: [amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/AMD-RyzenTM-5800XT-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0D6NNDQ92)",Negative
AMD,Being discontinued? The 5800X3D production has been discontinued since 2024. You can't get a good retail price 5800X3D now.,Positive
AMD,Honestly you really should upgrade to AM5 and just get a modern CPU and RAM for that GPU,Neutral
AMD,"I had this dilemma too, upgrading from a 5500, I ultimately decided to just get a 5070ti then wait a few months and fully upgrade to AM5 cause GPU was the first priority for me",Neutral
AMD,"What is your budget? A 7600x bundle will cost about the same as a 5800x3d so I'd just go AM5. If you have the budget, you could go even faster, like a 9700x or 7800x3d. The 4090 is a beastly card. What resolution is your monitor and what games do you play?",Neutral
AMD,"If you buy a new 5800x3d it will be the same cost as a new 7600x3d mobo+cpu+ram combo from microcenter. Gets your foot in the door to the next socket, a good gaming cpu, and 32gb of ram.",Neutral
AMD,Honestly I’d sell the 4090 and get a new setup with a 4080 lol. How much do you actually need the 4090?,Neutral
AMD,"the ryzen 9 5950x is super cheap atm, but the 5800x3d is much better for gaming",Positive
AMD,i think people who haven't looked at prices in a while assume they cost $200 or $250. but it's like $300 now for any am4 x3d.,Neutral
AMD,i know i got my pc prebuilt as a gift 2 years ago and im just know doing research on it 💔,Neutral
AMD,So crazy,Negative
AMD,"costs is way more, cpu+mobo+memory vs just a cpu.",Neutral
AMD,I bought one at micro center last week..139$,Neutral
AMD,This is the one !!,Neutral
AMD,would getting a combo mobo cpu ram on newegg also be a good option?,Neutral
AMD,i don’t really have a budget if i need to i’ll get it eventually. I have a 1440p monitor right now and i mainly play fps games like marvel rivals and overwatch.,Neutral
AMD,"I’m not really sure. This pc was a prebuilt gift, and i’m just now realizing how weird my gpu/CPU combo is. I’m trying to “fix it” so my fps in games are better and i’m not bottlenecking my cpu",Negative
AMD,You now I understand that!,Neutral
AMD,"With how insane the 5700X3D and especially 5800X3D pricing has gotten, it's not.",Negative
AMD,5700X3D is way too overpriced,Neutral
AMD,Unfortunately the AM4 x3d chips are way too expensive rn. He'll have the ability to sell his AM4 stuff and make some money back too. AM5 just makes too much sense in this market,Negative
AMD,"It could be. Its not always a huge savings vs buying everything on its own, and Newegg limits the combo options. I prefer to use PC part picker, sort price low to high, and buy the highest rated option with the features I want. Heres an example of what I found: [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/VzKkKX](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/VzKkKX)  I made a newegg combo thats very similar but with the 7600 instead of 7600x. The Newegg combo saved about $15 but for a slightly slower clocked CPU.",Neutral
AMD,"A 7600x will be fine in most games, especially at 1440p 144hz but as a fellow fps player I'd get a higher tier for better 1% lows (especially in rivals). A 9700x or 7/9800x3d chip will give you a smoother experience. If you have a 240hz panel then you should definitely get the faster chips.",Positive
AMD,"Nah don’t sell the 4090 they are getting up in value as the time goes by, if you want to save money you can buy some used parts, you could even begin with a 7600x and a decent b650, and later on upgrade to a 7800x3d, also AliExpress has really good deals on cpus, I bought a R7 7700 for 165",Neutral
AMD,"yes as other commentator said, do not sell 4090, it is a very powerful card and it will last very long",Positive
AMD,yeah it’s avg 350-400 right now.,Neutral
AMD,but you don't need to buy those overpriced cpus.,Neutral
AMD,£210 here.,Neutral
AMD,"For $400 just go to AM5, AM4 is a dead socket and is 100% not worth spending that kind of money to get more performance out of it.   For $500 you can get a used 7800x3d with a mobo and ram that would beat the 5800x3d in everything while being on the newer platform.",Negative
AMD,"$400 was the price I paid for a 9700x/b650/32gb ram bundle I bought. Not worth getting the AM4 CPUs at those prices, unfortunately.",Negative
AMD,"The comparison is because the performance between the entry AM5 CPUs is roughly on par with the 5\*00X3D CPUs.  I mentioned below that the Ryzen 5600 is already about 15% faster than the Ryzen 5500. The Ryzen 5800XT is maybe the fastest non-X3D AM4 CPU for gaming, but it's 4% faster at best than the Ryzen 5600. Looking at AM4 CPU pricing right now, I'd actually suggest the Ryzen 5700 since it's got 8 cores and slightly higher base clock speeds, and is only $10 more than the 5600. A few weeks ago the 5800XT was on sale for the same price as the 5600, which would have been a great buy. But at it's current price isn't worth the premium.",Neutral
AMD,Then what is he upgrading to?,Neutral
AMD,"on amazon, the 5600 is $140 and the 5800xt is $160.  so if you're sensitive about a $20 diff (hey, get the 5600 then), then surely a full am5 upgrade is not on the table since it's going to be over $500 to swap everything.  i think your point is to just not upgrade at all since it's so marginal (unless you pay big for the x3d) and instead plan on am5 being your next upgrade when you need it.",Neutral
AMD,"nothing. unless they have a specific perf target and the 5600 is too slow somehow, what are they upgrading for.",Negative
AMD,But he wants to upgrade so your comment is not helpfull,Negative
AMD,"everyone wants to upgrade because it's mostly consumerism. their options are pay big for am4 x3d or pay even bigger for am5.  their question has been answered like 20 times, so now we can move on to the commentary about the answers people provided. got it?",Neutral
AMD,"Nope, not helpful.",Negative
AMD,is your feedback helpful?,Neutral
AMD,"I play at 1440p with a 5600X and 6750XT. Normally I will hit 50-60% utilization. With the release of Borderlands 4,  a very demanding UE5 game that I use FSR and FrameGen on, I am consistently seeing 80-90+% utilization.",Positive
AMD,I recommend you run some other CPU related benchmarks to see where you performance is at.,Neutral
AMD,"Why are you concerned about this and why are you locking games to 60-90 fps when you have a 240Hz screen?   Is performance hampered if you play it at normal settings?   The usage should be high if your frames are uncapped and your GPU isn't stressed, which yours won't be. Operating temps of 80-85C are also normal.",Negative
AMD,Your cpu temps seem a little high. If this was a newer chip it wouldn’t be a problem.    You might be able to gain a little performance with a repaste or a different cooler.  Can you tell us what you have now so we can see if there is a problem?,Neutral
AMD,Do you have DLSS/FSR enabled?,Neutral
AMD,"What games are struggling to run at 60 fps at 1080? I’d think your system would be more than capable of pushing double that, even at 1440p   In task manager, performance, click on CPU and see if all the cores are being maxed out, or just a few",Neutral
AMD,"I would say increase your graphics settings. By using low settings, at 1080p, you’re not letting the GPU work and is “showing” the CPU “bottleneck”.   Those temps for the 5800x on an air cooler aren’t too far out of normal especially if you’re near 100% usage. It’s a hot chip. IF you want it to run at a lower temp, you could just set 65w eco mode in the bios. It has a small performance hit that most people claim to not really notice/care about.  Something still seems off though. But do report back how your FPS changes when utilizing more GPU.",Neutral
AMD,My 5800x was running so hot I had to lower the voltage and clock rate to stop my computer from shutting down whenever i played an intensive game. But I believe it was overclocked without me realizing it. No more sputters and crashes after I lowered the settings a bit in Ryzen Master,Neutral
AMD,5800x gets hot very fast and stays this way. Apparently that's how it should work. It was said it's because of the higher power draw. Don't know if that's correct though. Anyway because of temperature I took it out 20 minutes after I've put it in and returned it. Got 5700x instead and it's ok.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, this sounds about right newer games will use as much CPU as u can give them. Maybe turn down some of the more CPU intense settings.   For B06 definitely turn off the water caustics and extra shadows. Same with reflections and particles",Neutral
AMD,"The 5800x3d can't have a 90% utilization in bo6 with a 60fps lock. Something is wrong. Maybe some cores are deactivated or an software issue? If you open the task manager and check utilization while playing, are really 80-90% of the CPU utilization going towards the game?  Normally it's not a bad thing to have a high utilization on the cpu as long as you get the needed fps.",Negative
AMD,1080p or 1440p?  Is your monitor plugged into the GPU or the mobo?,Neutral
AMD,"i dunno, so far i havent run into any games that pushes my 5600 past 70 or so percent ..i know theres some crap coded games out there though, especially new releases, that can even choke a 5090 lol .. i wouldnt cater my build to a junk game ..",Negative
AMD,I think from another persons suggestion it maybe me not playing at 1440p possibly causing the problem as the GPU isn’t being used to its fullest.,Negative
AMD,What programs would you recommend?,Neutral
AMD,"I'm concerned because the performance is being hampered with stutters on some games. I'd like to run at a smooth fps and the reason I lock it at 60-90fps on some story games is because I don't need all the frames as opposed to a comp game. Again I only play zombies on Black ops 6 not much multiplayer so no need to be on 240hz, 120fps on zombies is just fine.",Negative
AMD,The cooler I have now is a noctua dh-15,Neutral
AMD,"I tend to force DLSS 4 for newer games, and sometimes use FSR",Neutral
AMD,"I tend to force DLSS 4 for newer games, and sometimes use FSR",Neutral
AMD,"Black Ops 6, Stellar Blade, the new skate they all use like 100% of my CPU. However just looking at task manager and all my cores are being used",Neutral
AMD,"The trouble I find with increasing the graphics sometimes is figuring out what settings impact the GPU and what ones impact the CPU, thankfully some games will tell you",Neutral
AMD,"> The 5800x3d  They have a 5800x, not a 5800x3d.",Neutral
AMD,Well to be fair in Black Ops 6s case it’s locked to 120fps,Neutral
AMD,1080p and yeah it’s plugged into the GPU through display port as I’m on a 240hz monitor,Neutral
AMD,> Is your monitor plugged into the GPU or the mobo?  How is this relevant to the high CPU utilization?,Neutral
AMD,As I understand it it's actually lower resolutions that require more CPU as that tends to push FPS higher.,Neutral
AMD,Use passmark and cinebench r23,Neutral
AMD,Cinebench r23 is very good choice,Positive
AMD,Passmark and userbenchmark should be enough.   __________________   Note: userbenchmark's opinions and rankings are questionnable to say the least. But the benchmark pass itself should also be appropriate to highlight any performance difference between your CPU and the average 5800x,Neutral
AMD,"What's CPU usage on idle? You can easily check what's eating up the usage just using task manager. Stuttering could be caused by a number of things ranging from minor to replacement part. Unfortunately it's not very descriptive.   My 2 cents is that there's absolutely no reason to be limiting your fps here. You paid for 240hz, you should use it regardless of if it's a competitive game or not. Change all settings back to normal, uncap the FPS and enable/disable Vsync and see if it makes a difference.  Your rig is more than capable of 1440p high refresh gaming, let alone 1080p.",Negative
AMD,"Those are decent. I would check fan curve and airflow are ok, clean from dust and consider a repaste with better stuff or ptm.",Positive
AMD,"Thats why. DLSS and FSR leverage CPU performance.   This is why for those who run 1440p and especially 4K, its why CPU performance still matters - because of scaling tech.    If you disable it entirely to run native 1080p you'll see CPU utilization drop to 40% or less and GPU utilization will be higher.   IMO DLSS/FSR at 1080p is kinda useless. An argument can be made regarding it looking ""cleaner"" and ""less aliased"" than native, but that can also be achieved by running the game at a higher base resolution with DLSS, or use DLAA - either as an in-game option if available, or at the driver level.   In which case, its all normal and totally dependent on what your settings are.   If you're happy with the performance you're getting, then no need to change anything as everything is working as intended.",Neutral
AMD,Time for a 7800x3d or 9800 if your feeling fancy,Neutral
AMD,"Ah, my mistake. Nonetheless should it perform better.",Positive
AMD,Still. It should look like this https://youtu.be/WjNIJOIscpY?si=3d1WmX_lY_pSDFu6 (Minute 9:40). Even at 1080p Low settings your 3070 should be the limiting factor.,Neutral
AMD,"Some people, having bad graphic results, switch all their settings to more cpu intensive graphics. Step one of diagnosis: maybe he had bad graphics because he wasn't using the GPU.",Negative
AMD,"Effectively, yeah; it basically takes the same amount of work for the CPU to generate the information for a frame at 1080p or 1440p, but at lower resolutions it's easier for the GPU to generate a frame, which means it's asking the CPU for new information to draw more often.",Neutral
AMD,Would you by any chance have any recommendations for good fan curves?,Neutral
AMD,That was my initial problem with turning off DLSS or FSR as most games have TAA forced and it makes game look very blurry.  So to add onto your point would you recommend me using in the nvidia control panel DSR to upscale to 1440p? Even though I’m on a 1080p monitor?,Negative
AMD,"Sadly it’s not doing that for me, I mainly play zombies and sometimes it’ll dip below 90fps when I’ve locked it at 120fps.",Negative
AMD,5800x and most AM4 stuff don't have any integrated graphics.,Negative
AMD,"I see what you are getting at, but there is no world in which running BO6 results on the integrated graphics of a 5800x results in higher CPU usage than GPU usage. That's literally impossible, that iGPU can barely drive minesweeper.",Negative
AMD,"That's going to vary by system.  There are a lot of variables like the case, fans in use, cooler, CPU, other components, etc.    The first thing to try is just putting your fans at 100% and see if it can keep the chip cool. Obviously that isn't ideal long term.  Then I would put some kind of load on it like cinebench or something and then play with the fan curve in software while it's going.  You want to balance temps with noise and find what you can tolerate while still maintaining good temps.  if your CPU is hot on 100% fans, then either the fan setup is bad (not enough, pointed the wrong way, not enough intake, etc) or its not enough for the chip.  A 5800x should be fine with your cooler.  I've run a 5800x on a smaller noctua than that and done ok.  However, my system had several additional case fans too.",Neutral
AMD,"No, using DSR is a global change to your desktop.   You can simply go into each games settings and there should be an option for internal resolution/render resolution - 178% of 1080p would mean internal render resolution would have the game run at around 1440p. Then you can use DLSS/FSR to Balanced or Quality to rescale it to a lower output resolution at around 1080p.   Or, again, force DLAA.",Neutral
AMD,And its not an overheating issue? In the video you see the frequency the CPU hits. Does your cou hit the Same frequencies?,Neutral
AMD,There is no igpu on that model,Negative
AMD,"Ahhhh I understand ya, I’ll give it a go",Positive
AMD,What's your current hardware spec and what type of plugins do you plan on using? What buffer size and sample rate?,Neutral
AMD,"Since your GPU is dying, I’d say get the best one you can afford… with the intent of replacing the CPU. At 1080, most GPUs will be great but the CPU will struggle feeding it. If there’s no intention of a CPU upgrade down the road, I’d even consider a 3060 for 1080p.",Neutral
AMD,"Best bet is get the Rtx 4060, or the better value Rx 6700 XT because they can play almost any game at 60 fps. If it's available, get the Rtx 2080 ti because it's the Best performer of them both, and will utilize the CPU to it's absolute limit. My recommendation is the Rx 6700 XT because it will have infinite drivers and has 12GB of vram, so if you wanna play at 1440p, you can.",Positive
AMD,I had the same setup.  I upgraded to a 6800xt and then swapped the CPU out for a 5700x.  I have no problems playing games at 2k ultra wide.,Positive
AMD,"I’m currently upgrading from the same cpu, the gpu that was in the pre build was a 1660. Ngl, it’s served its purpose well for many years.   Don’t get me wrong it’s not an amazing card, but I don’t play games on high really. Never had issues with games like apex and alike.   Not telling you to get a 1660 just throwing my 2 cents in",Positive
AMD,"Why worry about bottlenecks? Why try to be efficient?   You have a 5 year old CPU and a what, six year old GPU?   Upgrade to the best GPU you can afford. Then think about CPU next year.   I've had a 3600 for 5 years and been running 3060ti for three years. It still goes fine - been wanting an upgrade for a while but everything I play is still totally fine at 1440p so it's hard to justify.  Buy the best GPU you can reasonably afford without being silly. Eventually you are going to upgrade that CPU and probably Mboard and RAM too. And a 40 series card or, even better 90series AMD will still be relevant for years to come.  9060XT 16GB is such a sweet price point if you're on 1080. Unless you want the Nividia software tech then just don't worry about it.",Neutral
AMD,where do you live and what's your budget?,Neutral
AMD,"maybe just 4060, used to have the same cpu and was fine with 4060. when I upgraded the graphics card further I upgraded the cpu because it didn't keep up",Neutral
AMD,"Take [this table](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388-2.html) and find your GPU. I see 23% at 1440p, where a 4090 would be 100. Keep this number in mind.  Now you can use this table to calculate price/performance on any GPU you see for sale in your local used market. You can also use it to ballpark the performance uplift you want.",Neutral
AMD,I’d go for a 16gb 9060xt.,Neutral
AMD,The 3060 12gb version did so good eith the 3600.  I had it for a few years until I had to upgrade for borderlands 4 lol,Positive

AMD,looking for something a little more powerful,Neutral
AMD,"id go around the 9060xt 16gb, anything higher will be insane bottlenecks. even with it u will be cpu bottlenecked quite hard but its a relatively cheap gpu with alot of vram and insane clock speeds. and amd is amazing",Positive
AMD,"Ignore anything you read about ""bottlenecks"" - it's much more a marketing term than anything else for most situations.  You buy the best GPU you can afford to buy. You upgrade your system over time to the best you can afford to, whether that be upgrading the CPU to a 5800X (or 5700X3D if you can find one cheaply) or to upgrade to an AM5 system later on.",Neutral
AMD,"No, what would be about the max your cpu should be able to handle without any real bottleneck. Maybe some newer game won’t like it as much, but it would still be the best you can get. The card is still only as fast as a 3070 and people paired that with a 3600 too.",Neutral
AMD,i'd go with the RX 9070 more VRAM better drivers better performance its more money but should last you longer,Positive
AMD,Bro that thing looks less like a PC and more like it’s about to open a portal to hell,Negative
AMD,9070!!,Neutral

AMD,"The 8400f is junk, the 9060xt 8gb is junk, so no.   I mean I sold a $500 PC with a Ryzen 3600 and rtx 2070 super this week. It cost me under $400 to build. Worse, absolutely. Meaningfully worse? Not really.   The 8400f is L3 cache limited, which is an issue. It's also pci-e lane limited, running the GPU at pci-e gen 4x4 which also limits a 9060xt a tick. The 8gb of vram on the GPU causes you to not really be able to crank the settings up cause you'll run out of vram.   The $1000 or less new PC budget, you're generally going to be looking for a used PC in the $500-600 range instead. The New options are so crippled at that price point you're better off with something a bit weaker for less money, saving you $400 for a future upgrade to the next PC.   Now, $1000 new-old stock is where the fire sale PCs can fall, but those will be available in limited quantities and sell fast. Like last year lots of 12th/13th gen i7 and rtx 4070/7800xt PCs hit that $1000 price point and were significantly better than what you're looking at right now.",Negative
AMD,"No. Absolutely not, the CPU is bad and the GPU only has 8GB of VRAM.",Negative
AMD,"Price too high for this build, 9060XT are 8GB version, and 8400f aren't that great, you can find better for that price.",Negative
AMD,Try to get at least a GPU with 12-16GB of Vram   9060xt 16GB PC with a 7500F you can build yourself for around 1K (adequate for 1440p gaming). A Pre built PC with the same specs shouldn't cost more than 1.1k imo. But maybe you want to build one for your girlfriend. Give it a bit of personality :),Neutral
AMD,"""The $1000 or less new PC budget""  ***proceeds to say ""***you're generally going to be looking for a used PC in the $500-600 range instead***""***  You're not wrong, however if he has the money and wants to go full spending, he can't aim for a 500$ with a 4 generations-old GPU and a decade old CPU.",Neutral
AMD,"It's a weird deal where I just can't recommend going there because the stuff is so crippled you really box yourself in.   The thing is, the new-old stock when they do fire sales at $1000 blows the shit outta something like a 8400f/Rx 9060xt 8gb.   Used, it's worse. But not really, because long term the limitations with a used PC and the new 8400f/9060xt 8gb are the shit CPU and 8gb of vram. Same limitations, once the Ryzen 3600 is a problem, so is a 8400f like a few months later. Once the 2070 super's 8gb of vram is the issue, so is the 9060xt with its 8gb of vram.  It's a weird deal where these PCs with a 8400f/9060xt just are so crippled in certain ways you get screwed down the road hard with them.",Negative
AMD,Make sure your BIOS is updated because you are supposed to be able to adjust that in the BIOS. It might be named something different. Check your manual,Neutral

There is about 5-10% performance increase from the 5070Ti and then there's an absolute grand canyon of a difference from 5080 to 5090.   The 9800X3D is basically the best gaming cpu you can get right now and the 5070Ti is the best gaming option if you're not a gajillionaire, so the combo is wonderful.",Negative

AMD,7800x3d and 5070 ti. Use 200 euros difference for alcohol.,Neutral
AMD,I dont think any MMO has the fidelity to profit from a 5080. However CPU loads can get pretty high so you benefit from the X3D more. That said even with the lesser of both parts i dont think you would have issues in literally any MMO and would still be able to max out 4k 120fps.,Neutral
AMD,"5080 is often >30% more expensive for being just a little faster than 5070ti/9070xt.  Edit. Also online games tend to be light for GPU and sometimes heavy for CPU, so an X3D CPU should be a way better chocie.",Neutral

AMD,MMOs will benefit more from the 9800x3d over the 9700x than a 5080 over a 5080 Ti.,Positive
AMD,9800 with 5070 @ 2k,Neutral
AMD,Definitely go for a 7800x3d instead. Not a single MMO out there would be able to crank that CPU to its maximum. A 9800x3D is just plain overkill and a waste of money for your usecase imo. Rather spend it on a RTX 5080 (although that is also overkill for MMO's).,Negative

AMD,"X3D.  You're not really upgrading from a 5070 TI and a 5080.  It's like sub 10% across all applications.  Even a 7800X3D would be more of an upgrade from a 9700X, let alone a 9800X3D, in gaming applications of course.",Neutral

AMD,"Personally, I had to settle for the 7800x3d as the 9800 wasn't available where I was.  Also decided to go on the ""cooler"" side with a windforce GPU rather than one that runs hotter. My MSI one degraded within a couple years due to lack of cooling. Which is odd given the case had ten fans.",Negative

AMD,I've seen 9070XTs for under 675. MSRP on a 5070ti is 750.,Neutral
AMD,It was a 3070 the MSI.  Highest the gigabyte windforce 5070 Ti has his was 66C in Helldivers with around 100% utilization.   Not bad given how that game isn't optimized at all.  Usually around 62C in UE5 games when maxed out.,Neutral
AMD,"I mean it did come with a GPU with a better clock speed, but again stock issues.  Sadly it's sometimes cheaper to buy pre-made in Canada than to make our own. In this case $600 cheaper.",Negative
AMD,You sure it is not the 9070 and tbh 75$ cheaper ain't that good of a deal and anyone would pay the extra 75 for 5070ti cause of dlss 4 which is still better than fsr 4 and ofc you get cuda and a better path tracing performance if that matters,Negative
AMD,Thats wild since its a lower powered card. Any 3 fan card should do fine with airflow. Did you ever repaste it? Should repaste every 3~ years ime,Neutral
AMD,"I checked before I posted.  Definitely was an XT.  75 is borderline not worth the cost IMO. FSR4 is close enough to DLSS at the resolutions your likely targeting with that level.  Can you pause and pixel peep show  Everyone cites cuda but no body can tell me what they actually use it for.  I do all sorts of work - content and video editing, AI, coding, etc. I've never had issues running professional software on AMD systems (or Nvidia).   My thought process is this: If you're shopping under top end, you're likely working with a budget. The 9070XT is very competitive with the 5070Ti. So if you're on a budget, check the games you play - see how they perform on each. Path tracing is kinda silly since it's only in a couple games but it may be important to some.  It's likely not worth it at this performance tier anyway (my 4090 even wasn't great at it and these are slower). 75 dollars could be the difference between an x3d chip and a regular chip.",Neutral
AMD,"No never reached the three year marker on it.  I also don't overclock so I never saw a need to repaste.   More than likely the PSU probably caused some damage. Was forced to use a DeepCool as Corsair and ThermalTake were hard to find, and very expensive during the pandemic in Canada.",Negative
AMD,Cuda does everything and software does but better the biggest gap is in 3d rendering where amd simply sucks   Anyway dlss 4 has way more support than fsr 4 no modding needed and it looks better like dlss 4 on performance looks as good as fsr 4 on balanced they are close it can be overseen but still and you get a superior framegen I have tested fsr 4 on my brothers 9060xt 16gb and r5 5600 it looks as good as dlss 3 but still it is not quite dlss 4 accuracy it just isn't if we include dlss fg and mfg the difference is worth 30$ if you ask me and the other 45$? That is for cuda alone and ofc the path tracing difference is still big   And 675 isn't competitive with 5070ti and availability at this price is absurdly low 95% of the time you will see a 700-750$ 9070xt still not worth it 75$ is something when you are comparing 5060ti and 9060xt but 5070ti and 9070xt that is 10% Saving and for what? for the sake of saving  Fanboying has never been so stupid 9070xt is better at 600$ at 675-750 that is 5070ti territory it is like when amd tried to sell 7900xt at 700$ and expected people to pay just cause it is cheaper   Rdna 4 is amazing I tried the 9060xt this thing is 1 step from becoming as good as my 3080 but still the path tracing performance needs more work the lack of cuda is an L for many yeah it is a lot better than the rx5500xt my brother had before but still need quite more work you save money when the products are identical or the cost difference is higher than 10%   Have a great day,Positive
AMD,Yea thats either a manufacturer defect or your psu fried it. Never heard of a gpu dieing from heat unless they somehow didnt have any fans running at all haha,Negative
AMD,"Usually it only ran, at the highest, 80C.  Not as cool as the one I got now, but I also had issues with MSI that have kind of pushed me away.  They weren't playing nice on warranty, the bios issue was hell, and the exhaust fan broke twice in three months.  Suspect they've been cheaping out since the pandemic.",Negative
AMD,Definitely a manufacturer defect. I only use aorus for my gpu's and I've had amazing luck thankfully. I do use msi motherboards though as I like their bios and vrm specs. 30 series was definitely warmer but 80° on a 3070 seems high to me. Good thing you have a good gpu now though,Positive
AMD,"Thankfully.   Only thing I need to watch on this card is the thermal gel thing.  I doubt it'll happen though as the card, when I checked the serial number, was made in May after they acknowledged the issue. It's also not vertical mounted. Either way I'll see if it starts heating up, and I got a two year warranty from the retailer in addition to Gigabyte's.",Neutral

AMD,"it can do rdr2 at about 30fps if you set the game to 900p at the lowest settings. Some other games it'll do better at. Overall you'd have a pretty similar experience to someone using a steam deck in most titles, though always a little on the better side.",Positive

For $600 brand new you can get an Rx 9070 which is just as fast as native, has faster raytracing, and FSR 4 support as more games implement it. You shouldn't really be crashing though. Have you updated your motherboard's bios?",Positive
AMD,"game crashes often arent graphic card related unless you are using older drivers or card is overheating. mostly its windows releated, ram memory isnt stable or some junk is working in the background.   maybe get new RX 9070 instead.",Negative

Like seriously, only installing new things myself that I actually want and use?

Fingers crossed the steam deck and steamOS gets widespread linux compatibility over the final hurdle, game compatibility is literally the only reason I'm not running it (though R6 is kinda ass now so I might end up switching anyways).   Of course banning kernel-level anti-cheat and any other kernel-level software that has any ulterior function other than anti-virus, is the ultimate goal since anything with access to your kernels is fully capable of using your computer to commit crime.

AMD,"No. These are older than that. It literally says the 7000 series and that’s what they were called - 7970, etc.   The R9 290X was released in 2013.",Neutral
AMD,"Wrong. GCN 1.0 was 7000 series (with exception of 7790 which was GCN 1.1). R9 200 series was a mix of 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 (Hawai’i and Bonaire were 1.1, Tahiti, Pitcairn, and Oland 1.0 and Tonga 1.2).",Neutral

Absolutely wonderful experience coming from a GTX 460 and many Nvidia cards before.

AMD,We have our own tho. Look up XMMS.  100% compatible with Winamp skins iirc.,Positive
AMD,"True, but Winamp works just fine through Wine or Bottles.",Positive
AMD,"It very nearly got a Linux port way back in the original v3/v5 days. Sadly it was canceled. But then XMMS, and later Audacious, were created, possibly as a response.  The developers of the current Winamp successor, WACUP, also stress their Wine support. WACUP would *like* to have a native port to Linux, but they don't really have anyone willing to do it right now. Most of WACUP development is still just one guy far as I know.",Negative
AMD,"Not a great reason. Putting ""Win"" in the name was to differentiate it from DOS-based players. That's how old Winamp is. Winamp even had a DOS version at first.  There was supposed to be a Linux port, though it was canceled. There were successful Mac ports since the beginning.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, I guess, though there are still a ton of games I play that are windows exclusive unfortunately.  What's funny is I'm waiting for windows to ban kernel level access, because once that happens linux compatibility will probably become universal (or at least, the games that don't work on linux, also won't work on windows).",Negative
AMD,"Memory was a weak point yes, but in terms of processing power the 360 gpu was arguably top of the market when it hit, being pushed down to second place a month or so later. PC hardware was moving very quickly then, but the concepts placed in its gpu carried over to next gen gpus in the pc quite well.   I would also say shared memory on the Xbox one was deceptive as more was reserved (10% originally) for the system lowering useable pool by the gpu and cpu, home towers by the point often had 8gb of memory with gpus between 2 and 4gb, though quickly moving to 6 to 8. The 2 and 3 gig gpus left at moderate settings quite quickly.   Further I would say the evidence of hindering next gen games can be seen in what we know were axed from titles supporting it, like infinite local co-op, and comments by developers like the Xbox one/ Xbox series gen. Vs how the games that made the jump from the 360 generation to the one generation faired.   The series S while a sales darling is another boat anchor around game development (see baldurs gate 3) for the Xbox brand, it’s truly unfortunate how often they knee cap themselves… I say this as an original Xbox owner and until about 2 years ago gold/ultimate player.",Neutral
AMD,"we all ran XP till 7 beta came out.  we also had more than 1.5gb of ram, at least the peeps i hung out with on IRC.",Neutral
AMD,"I would say on the hardware front we have seen great gains, it’s more the development front that has stagnated relying too much on middleware and not leveraging hardware properly… or where they do for features who’s returns are dubious…. It’s not the 00s where each generation was a wizbang upgrade, nor the early 10s where resources for resolution popped…. Nvidia is focused else where, and is still recovering from almost dieing as a company, and gpus paid a heavy price… and intel is dealing with a decade of poor choices…. Despite all of that hardware has advanced pretty well, while your hardware can probably last a decade at this point with settings degrading until playability is lost, it’s not a hardware progression issue. Check out what they were doing with the 360 at the end of its run… compared to what came out the end of the Xbox one run… not to much of a change outside of some major temples like rdr2, and that quality of a game is far between release as to what we should have…. Developers have been leaning on performance improvements to put less work into games",Neutral
AMD,Doesn't change those were release in 2011,Neutral
AMD,The 290X is not a rebrand of anything.,Neutral
AMD,"Not really sure how that's relevant since my point was that it goes back even further than the RX series, but it would apply to all of them if they are using the same GPU.",Neutral

AMD,There also was the RX 285 and R7 250. Other than that they were all rebrands.,Neutral
AMD,He literally said a mix of GCN 1.0-1.2 on the 200-series though. So his comment isn't wrong. But it kinda contradicts his statement.  The 2XX series had a lot of rebranded cards.,Neutral

AMD,Yeap.,Neutral
AMD,"Rebranded, yes. But 7970 GHz is higher clocked than 280X. The 7970 GHz edition is therefore faster, marginally though. [280X](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-r9-280x.c2398) [7970 GHz](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-hd-7970-ghz-edition.c365)",Neutral
AMD,"Aye, and the dual GPU cards was pretty cool. Nvidia also had a few! Not to mention 3DFX which actually created SLI.",Positive
AMD,"I never used that generation, but it is infamous for the driver issues.    I never had any more issues with ATI/AMD than with Nvidia. Far less black screens with AMD/ATI, especially early on with ATI as their ""VPU"" recover was far superior to Nvidas ditto. To be fair it took a few years for Nvidia to make a similar function that worked, if I remember correctly. More issues on new releases with AMD though. Which is expected as developers would be stupid to not focus optimizing for Nvidia due to market share. But in general hardware has been really stable last 10-15 years IMO, at least compared to late 90's early 2000's :D",Neutral
AMD,"Calling it Linamp would imply it only runs on Linux.  The creators of XMMS were thinking big. XMMS not only runs on Linux, but also BSDs, Solaris and more. It can even run on Windows using Cygwin or MingW. As long as it supports Unix C and has an X server, it runs XMMS.",Neutral

AMD,"I had pretty regular crashes (maybe twice a week) for a year and a half or a so after i got it lol, even after ""the drivers have been fixed"" for the third time hahaha  It's a rock for me now, and I was never frustrated with it really because I got it knowing about driver issues and getting it cheap, and I was so happy with it's performance uplift vs my 970ti. I wasn't rich enough to get anything better and it was a steal, liek £150 off, becuase of driver issues I think. so I was really happy.   I get nauseous at low fps/hz, so I think that's probably teh biggest reason why I didn't care about the crashes - getting stable high frame rates in more games was way more significant than any crashes. I think if i was a normie I might've regretted it lol  it did feel like vintage hardware though lmao, it was so shitty the first couple months I had it especially",Positive
AMD,Posixamp doesn’t have the same ring to it,Neutral
AMD,I play multiplayer too,Neutral
AMD,Was there plans for a second cell chip?  I know initially they didn’t have the Nvidia GPU but I thought it was a “this single cell chip and SPEs can do everything!”,Neutral
AMD,"Dang. I would've been fairly annoyed with that amount of crashes to be honest :P But I also sacrifice all I can to keep a high refresh-rate.  I've refunded games locked at 60FPS many times. But since AFMF2 released some have been spared if it worked well, like SOMA.  Edit: Wow, double posted apparently ""error 500""..",Negative
AMD,Also there’s already a separate project called Linamp. Apparently it’s some touchscreen in car entertainment system that runs Linux.,Neutral
AMD,"I could have sworn it was, but it’s been a bit since I read through it I know the ps3 gpu was a very late addition to the hardware",Neutral
AMD,If I remember well the CELL itself was suppossed to be used for graphics processing on it's own too.  After all it is a CPU with a single core with SMT and seven SPEs as co-processors   But it wouldn't panned out well so they added an NVidia GPU late in development.  Still the CELL had some strong points compared to the GPU so some devs used it to improve graphics too.,Neutral
AMD,"Cell was a very interesting chip, especially if you had been following PowerPC before it. So much possibility and power, but required a lot of the dev team, and I don’t think Sony ever got the dev tools really worked out as well as they wanted. Huh, I wonder where I got the second cell chip from going to have to research that now",Positive
AMD,"I'm glad they've finally gotten PyTorch to use ROCm, but it's a shame more computational routines/libraries don't use Vulkan... you can already get LLMs working on GPUs as old as GCN 2.0 (RX 300-ish) on that. The one thing Vulkan can't access (yet) are the tensor cores... hopefully we'll see that soon.",Neutral
AMD,They promised this like since RDNA2. And RDNA2 is already in a maintenance state now. At lease it finally got there.  I used to think pytorch support will never arrive at amd card on windows though.,Neutral

AMD,"See, this is the problem with AMD. We just started reading about the performance improvements of Vulkan compared to ROCm on AMD cards and even some users found considerable improvements of LLM/PP improvements with ROCm-7 ([https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nr5h1i/60\_ts\_improvement\_for\_30b\_a3b\_from\_upgrading\_rocm](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nr5h1i/60_ts_improvement_for_30b_a3b_from_upgrading_rocm))  So, if I want performance for LLMs, I have to upgrade to ROCm7 or later but if want to use SD, I have to switch to this (6.4.4) or we have to keep using 6.4.4 for Stable diffusion and vulkan for LLM's.

AMD,"I'd be included in that. I held out for many years in the hope that AMD would figure something out for Windows support (e.g. Windows ROCm, HIP), but I couldn't hold out any longer and went for Nvidia. Now I can run whatever I want without worrying if my GPU supports it or not. I wish it wasn't like this, but I don't write the rules.  Universal APIs like Vulkan are what I hope become the standard, so that consumers don't become boxed into a single hardware vendor; but alas, I'm preaching to the choir.",Positive
AMD,Over a quarter of all dGPUs are AMD. You’re confusing quarterly shipment share with the installed dGPU base.,Neutral
AMD,"This makes them more usable I guess... well at least the ones that are supported by rocm, never mind the correct version.   Question is, this is so basic why didn't this happen 9 years ago?  But yeah, this could only make headlines in reddit or any parody newspaper that wants to make fun about the state of rocm.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, but it's (slowly) changing.  With HIP 6.4.2 and ZLUDA my 6800 XT @ 2700MHz is usually only 3-5% slower than a 3080 12G in ComfyUI, and thanks to the extra VRAM I can run model parameters that causes an OOM on the 3080.  Ray tracing still sucks on my card, but the RX 9000 series is basically just 1 generation behind as opposed to 2 or 3 generations on 6000/7000 series.  Same goes for video acceleration, the 9000 series codec is *actually* good now. Yes, that does nothing for 6000/7000 series, but they did finally listen to demands and address the problem.  As others have said, it's mostly a bit ""too little too late"", but if you compare the resources and R&D budget between Radeon and nVidia it is actually incredible that they're even remotely comparable when it comes to tech and features.",Neutral

AMD,"From my limited testing with a 9070 XT against a 5070 Ti, the 9070XT actually performs about 15-20% faster than the 5070 Ti in Wilds. Making the 9070XT one of the best cards in existence to play the game.  I suspect the reason is the GPU code having a lot of serial-limited performance, which is completely silly to run on a GPU in the first place, resulting in most Nvidia GPUs not having the boost clock headroom to compete in performance. The flip side is that Wilds will run at ~70% of normal power draw on Nvidia GPUs.",Positive
AMD,"9070 non xt here, game runs fine for 70+ series cards from both gpu manufacturers. You can easily get a locked 1440p 70+fps with a 9070 (FSR Quality). I keep mine unlocked and can get as high as 120+fps in some areas.  Youre not gunna get super high fps unless you have a 5090 or something but to say 60+fps = cant play the game well is so ridiculous. Yeah the game has performance issues but people saying its unplayable for mid/high tier cards is stupid.",Neutral
AMD,"I have a 9070XT. I play Wilds on Linux, it's pretty solid at 60FPS, roughly 1440p (4k but with FSR), HDR and ray tracing. It's a perfectly good card for this, especially if you happen to use Linux.",Positive
AMD,this is unbelievably false. i don't know what you call not-very-well or a shit-show but i have a 7800xt and it is far from unplayable or terrible. i will admit Capcom needs to really get their shit together with their last two releases having terrible optimization but this game runs well with my pc with some compromises to graphical fidelity. i'm playing on 1440p / fsr3 quality with most settings set to high and some to medium. it's not a polygonal mess or blurry textures or stuttery mess. i'm on windows as well not linux.       again it's not optimized but i can still achieve 60fps at 1440p with my 7800xt. a 9070xt i would imagine would run this much better than my setup.,Negative
AMD,"Wilds will be fine, title update 4 will bring the performance patch and the expansion will bring players back  The problem is all the new players got into worlds expansion iceborne with all the title updates and expected wilds to launch out of the gate like that, thats pretty unfair  Performance is pretty poor for low/mid end hardware for sure, but the same thing was said for world which was also really terrible performance wise.    The thing Monster Hunter has going for them is that its not a GAAS, so its pretty much timeless to play. Plenty of people are still playing rise, world, and even Generations ultimate which is getting really old at this point because theyre fun games.  Capcom already knows they messed up with wilds and theyre not gunna let their golden child burn to the ground like Dragons Dogma",Neutral

No two monster hunter game carries its core mechanic for that game over to the next one (Generations had skill attacks, world had clutch claw, rise had wirebug/skills) that change the way the game is played.     Wilds is also crossplay, and im sure its console concurrent playerbase is currently much larger than pc atm.     Yes the game is timeless and fun as referenced that all modern monster hunter games still have tons of players playing it every day.     If you love looking at concurrent player data then check when Monster Hunter World released and how its player base fluctuated after launch, after its expansion release, and after its final update back in 2020 Wilds has a lower but similar situation to World.

AMD,"Small note is iirc 9800X3D is easier to cool, because they moved the 3D v-cache. So the gains might be marginal, but it potentially has a longer life because of easier cooling.   Doesn't apply of course to people not using the CPU at full load, but it's a valid concern to solve with $120.",Neutral

AMD,"fr. The 5800X3D was an amazing upgrade for my existing build, in place of a 3600. I'm still running it, paired with a 3080. Likely not upgrading to 9070XT/AM5 just yet for the, what, 20 to 40% uplift?",Positive
AMD,Pretty sure at any given fps cap the 9800X3D will use the same or less power.,Neutral

AMD,"I wonder how they compare, both in eco mode, with a 60fps frame cap in a game that will easily run higher.",Neutral
AMD,"Tested it in Cyberpunk. Has some strengths over XeSS but also worse with RT particularly shadows (easy test spot: your apartment building boxing area), very stable image overall. Ofc big performance hit but probably worth it at least for some scenarios (rx6800 here).  Look forward to official support but reverted game version (had 2.2 modded already) & drivers, not such a big difference to be worth the extra hassle.  Given that it can maintain 30 fps w/ PT and look quite good at ~~4K (perf mode)~~ (later edit: kept switching resos & ratios, double checked and it was actually 2560x1080 not 4K for PT, apologies; still fine for consoles, but ofc not 21:9) on my rdna 2 card I wonder why they don't do a similar mode for ps5 pro and sell a lot more copies.",Positive
AMD,hope this gets officially released,Positive
AMD,On Rog Ally FSR 4 performance is miles better than FSR3.1 quality,Positive
AMD,"In certain games, it does make a pretty big difference, especially where there are moving objects, such as swaying grass, hair and a lot of particles.   The performance hit is a little higher than XESS, for substantially better image quality, and stability. For those on RDNA 2 and 3, this makes a massive difference as there are only lateral upgrades available for those cards. nvidia charges about 750 usd for a card that can actually use 16 gb of VRAM (5070 ti).       So there isnt really a tangible upgrade path for those on 16 gb versions of RDNA2/3 such as 6800xt and above except the 4090 or 5090.",Positive
AMD,"FSR Redstone can't come soon enough, even if performance and quality gains are minimal it working on everything in an official capacity will be a godsend.    10-20% performance hit is normal IMO, Turing cards get hit hard when running DLSS 4",Positive
AMD,"FSR 4 with INT8 has significantly worse image quality and more artifacts than regular FSR 4 with FP8, and the performance hit on RX 6000 and 7000 is quite big as the title says.  It is better than FSR 3 though.",Negative

AMD,"I appreciate the fact that we no longer have to deal with bad AA's but im not very excited by this and people are overhyping this ihmo.   The reason i changed my 6800 was mostly performance, so i don't really see how this should be THAT beneficial if i have to play at low medium settings with barely any RT anyways.",Negative

AMD,we need a tutorial on how to implement all this.,Neutral
AMD,"I finally got FSR 4 w/ Optiscaler working. I also did the 23.9.1 driver .dlls copy to 25.9.2. to fix shimmering, etc. I tested The Forever Winter. Amazing results. In my opinion, FSR 3 already looks good in-game, but FSR 4 made it look near-native. GPU power draw only went up 15 W, but temps (40c) and hotspot (60c) stayed the same. But I didn't test fps, I had capped at 60 with AFMF 2 for 120 fps, no microstutters or frame drops. My only issue though is after leaving the game, my deskop gets very slugglish. My guess is the modded 25.9.2 driver. In-game is fine, but going back to the desktop is pretty bad lol. Resetting the PC fixes it, but playing the game again causes the desktop feel very sluggish.

The quality of the upscaling outweighs the narrower framerate uplift, AMD could ship it in this preliminary state and it would already immensely benefit RDNA2 users  I guess even down to 6700XT we'd still benefit  Not sure it's okay for lesser models though (6700, 6650XT, 6600XT, 6600), because the INT8 TOPS drop sharply, they might be limited to performance mode at best and not always get an uplift  Well, the perf mode already looks better than FSR3 and XeSS anyway :)",Positive
AMD,PS5 Pro will be receiving FSR4 enhanced PSSR next year,Neutral
AMD,such old gpu isnt made for RT,Negative
AMD,I feel like the leak was intentional. It allows the community to develop an implementation to bring FSR4 to older hardware without AMD taking on the responsibility for an official release.,Neutral
AMD,It works great on some games in others not. The only game I tested fsr4 mod to work well is on dying light the beast. It has native fsr4 built in. I tested fsr4 on spiderman remastered and graphical glitches occured because of using the old driver 23.9.1,Positive
AMD,> Turing cards get hit hard when running DLSS 4  Definitely not true  You might be referring to Ray Reconstruction but you should've stated so because that's not the same as the main Upscaler component,Negative
AMD,"the difference is night and day, the weird shimmering around objects just disappear with frs 4 while on frs 3 it's god awful, Honestly I would take performance fsr 4 over quality frs 3.",Negative
AMD,"I believe the leaked int8 model was also a fair bit older than what is currently used in the released fsr4, so it may not be directly comparable.",Neutral

AMD,"I am quite happy with performance loss of about 7 % with my 7800xt compared to Fsr3. Tried it on Beast, difference is sky and earth.",Positive
AMD,"I think part of it has to do with the fact that the INT8 dll everyone is using only has Model 0. FSR Models, which are like DLSS Presets, are the settings that the algorithm uses like frame accumulation, etc. and ""Model 0"" is best tuned for Native/Ultra Quality settings.",Neutral

AMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/s/ZZmJzL1NuZ,Neutral
AMD,"I think its compared to the performance of FSR3, not native.  It's still better frame rates than native.",Positive
AMD,The comparison is FSR 4 vs FSR 3 at the same quality level. FSR 4 performance mode will look better than FSR 3 native while clawing back some of the lost FPS. This is not as black and white you think it is.,Neutral
AMD,"In my testing, FSR 4 is only slightly faster than the next higher tier of FSR 3 but it looks **significantly** better. So FSR 4 Balanced performs ~= FSR 3 Quality, but it looks almost as good as Native with some minor shimmer on very thin objects.",Positive
AMD,"its only comparing resolution scale percents. with FSR4, you can afford to use FSR4 Balanced over FSR3 Quality because there are things FSR4 properly renders that FSR3 outright cannot do, which mostly revolves around transparencies and thin object stability.  Thats why if you are going to do this, you should compare FSR4 Balanced to FSR3 Quality/Ultra Quality to see which one you like more. Some games might favor one over another. iirc for example with Ancient Gameplays tests, Black Myth Wu Kong will heavily prefer FSR4 regardless of setting because FSR3 can't handle the transparencies of the attacks, waterfalls, and leaf backdrops (similar to Ratchet and Clank intro scene that Hardware Unboxed tests). In a game like Marvel Rivals, FSR4 is marginal, so you might prefer getting the FPS that FSR3 provides over it.",Neutral
AMD,Yes night and day visual difference,Neutral
AMD,"at that point, just disable FSR. Not sure how people are missing this.",Negative
AMD,It does increase performance over native quality.,Neutral
AMD,"Upscalers feature settings and tweaks offering various levels of picture-quality-performance tradeoffs  They're not exclusively about increasing the FPS, but finding the best middleground for your needs and satisfaction  Good upscalers like DLSS4 and FSR4 depending on the settings go further  They can actually 'clean up' the often terrible native output that features forced TAA  So yeah it's not just purely about boosting FPS, it's a bit bigger deal than that, it's expanding video games specifics into the realm of video and photo processing (which have been longtime precursors, both in upscaling and frame interpolation)  Especially now that upscalers have become nearly unavoidable for AAA games and/or higher settings and resolutions displays anyway, like it or not",Positive
AMD,Render scaling not quality. It just so happens scaling down lowers quality.,Negative
AMD,"this might be an issue due to driver version, similar to what he describes at the beginning of this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTrfnLvZbu4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTrfnLvZbu4)",Neutral
AMD,"Just cap to 30. This was on vanilla 2.31 version of the game, but you can further tweak it for performance with mods like ultra plus ray tracing. Keep in mind that it's not really worth playing the game like that and with PT it is very crash prone. For us RT+PT from the same mod is much better (basically it adds extra bounce to RT GI so it looks closer to PT, but way more performant).",Neutral
AMD,Would you reckon it's way more possible it comes to rdna3 like the 7000 series. Would love to see it come to my 7800xt so I don't need to upgrade my gpu again 😅,Positive
AMD,"It's RT shadows (all lighting settings turned on) and in this case it was with ceiling grate shadows. Curiously it also happened with FSR 2 & 3 but not XeSS. Test there if you can maybe it was only happening for me (boxing area your apartment building, check floor for hexagonal shadows see if it fizzles).  Tbh it's actually good for all GPUs, even steam deck, because you'd want to run it for quality and are already at lower fps = more frametime available, so it's easy to stomach the performance cost trade-off. Where it's hard to use is for higher fps >60 because frametime budget is so tight the fixed cost becomes enormous, even on 7900 XTX. You need RDNA 4 for that scenario.",Neutral
AMD,"as some one with an rx 6650 xt, its still worth it with the better image quality. and sill usable with it being in my testing around 20% worse than xess.",Positive
AMD,Works well enough for me.,Positive
AMD,"I mean they could just add it to Radeon Sofware as flip switch (disabled by default) with a warning, that it will have performance hit on older cards compared to FSR3. FSR4 is visually superior and still provides gains over native. Can't see where's the problem to support it officially.",Neutral

AMD,not in alan wake 2,Negative
AMD,the best performance and image quality boost you can get is entirely disabling FSR then.,Positive
AMD,Now imagine how good DLSS 4 is and then you understand why upscaling is so important and why a 4070 Super with DLSS 4 Quality gives you a similar experience at 4k as the 7900 XTX  Edit: Lol. You say something good about AMD: upvotes. You take the same exact logic and say something good about Nvidia: downvotes,Positive
AMD,I just tested the int8 dll on my 9070XT and it has all 5 models showing in Optiscaler. Even changes model depending on Quality setting.,Neutral
AMD,RDNA2 particularly artifacts if you use any driver that released from RDNA3 launch and onward. It implies internally something changed in the driver that borked rdna2 from using it if you use any modern driver.,Neutral

AMD,glad you enjoy your 30fps blurry image.,Neutral
AMD,The 7800XT comes with instructions that specifically accelerate this kind of workload as compared to RDNA 2; not really sure what you’re on about.,Neutral
AMD,yes a gpu from 2020 is old. and amd never had a good gpu. 6800xt was a mid tier gpu that couldnt compete with the 3080.   the 6800xt needs the blurry fsr upscaler above 1080p to get 60fps+    you need and cant have reason to pretend amd is in any good spot.,Negative
AMD,"Anything you support officially is always your problem.    Having it off by default and having a warning that it's an experimental feature isn't a bad idea. You're still gonna have people dinging your support because something in your driver that you officially released is causing issues, or isn't working properly. It's just the way things are.   It could also be that they wanted to quietly gauge the community's response to the lower performance of the INT8 model before officially supporting it. If they had released it officially, and the community had an overwhelmingly negative response to the performance, they would face a good deal of backlash. This way they can make the release seem ""accidental"", which avoids the community backlash in the event of a negative reception, while allowing people to test it and determine the interest and acceptance of it.",Negative
AMD,Depends on amd. Because fsr4 is one of their main selling point for the 9000 series. But if nvidia can supportd dlss4 on older carss amd should too to be competitive.,Neutral
AMD,"To be honest, FSR 3 is only good for low end hardware that cant run the game otherwise. If a game runs at 35fps native but 60 with fsr balanced, then shimmering is 100% worth it. For example I game on integrated 780m GPU, and many games run native 20-25 FPS, but with FSR performance they reach to 60fps, thus making them playable.  But if it already runs at 80 and you push it to 100 with FSR 3 then it's not worth it.  Furthermore FSR 3 quality is absolutely the worst preset ever, problem isnt the lower upscaled resolution but the shimmering, jitteriness and fuzziness. So it is better to run balanced or performance preset  to get FPS boost to justify such downgrade in visuals.  DLSS or FSR4 is on the other hand gives almost free FPS with quality and balanced presets, assuming you are playing on at least 1440p resolution, there is absolutely no reason to not use them to get higher FPS.",Neutral
AMD,"The fact you got this comment upvoted on this subreddit in 2025 is absolutely hilarious.

AMD,"Yes, this is what I mean. FSR 3 or any upscaler actually is a god sent for low end hardware. But if someone has 7800XT or 7900XTX or something similar, I hardly recommend FSR 3.2.  Alongside having igpu PC, I also have 7800XT main gaming PC, and more often than not I regret turning on FSR3 to push 120fps to 144fps max refresh rate of monitor. I use lossless scaling or smooth motion instead.  For example on The last of us part 1, as soon as I turn on FSR 3.2, Joels hair gets all fuzzy. The fences become blurry, the power lines become jittery, the reflections becomes fuzzy, all this sacrefice to get 20 fps more? Not worth it.   But I will accept all of these on low end hardware.",Negative

AMD,"Since the IOD only has a 32B read/write connection out of the memory controller and a single link can do 32+16B, there would be very little benefit. The CCD would get 32+32 instead of 32+16.  This is not the case on threadripper/epyc because their IOD has a connection to the memory controller which is 64B+ wide, so using a second link allows them to deliver 64+32 to one CCD.  They need to get rid of the ridiculous infinity fabric bottleneck within the consumer IOD which can only move data half as fast as DDR5 peak bandwidth (2000fclk = 64GB/s read and write max, while dual-channel DDR5 8000 can deliver 128GB/s read).",Neutral

AMD,"Nah. The ‘tile design’ is something that Intel had in the lab for the longest time, it’s just that AMD brought a much simpler (cruder?) design way earlier to the market to cut production cost.  What Intel has been doing has advantages vs what AMD has been doing, with reduced latency and monolithic level idle power consumption. But it’s more expensive and harder to both design and implement. See Intel chip breakdown and it’s basically a freakin Tetris, every single segment divided into different chips and sometimes even produced by two different fabs (IFS/TSMC)  Even with Strix Halo, AMD approach to chiplet is more conservative but at the same time should be easier to implement. AMD tends to dump everything that is not core CPU logic into an IO chip made on a cheaper node, and over the last few generations they’ve just gotten extremely good at this. No need for Intel Tetris whatsoever, just a simple connection between CPU core and IO core and that’s it. And now without the interposer adding a gap between everything, with all the advantages Intel should have had. So it’s pretty neat.",Neutral

AMD,"There isn't significant extra read bandwidth. It's 32+32 instead of 32+16 on allcore.  Some old and/or bad tests like aida64 are inflated by the extra CCD having its own set of cache - they're inflated even by the cache of one CCD, reading impossibly high bandwidth and low latency -  but 2000 fclk doesn't actually do more than 64,000 MB/s read or write in any circumstance.  It has the same bandwidth per clock as it did with DDR4, when it would have had to double in width to maintain parity.",Neutral
AMD,"I agree that AMD's design is cruder lmao. Although I'd like to contend that AMD released the 1900 series Threadrippers all the way back in 2017 and subsequently Intel infamously called them ""glued together,"" mocking the multi-die design. So I'm not actually sure Intel had multi die designs in the works before AMD. It's like Intel was just watching because they didn't see AMD as a real threat but AMD using the previous refined node for the IO die plus AMDs ability to have a SKU for every single die no matter how messed up it was (even if it only had 2 viable cores) just slashed costs so much that Intel could not compete and they did nothing about it (besides release 14nm again).",Negative

AMD,"IIRC Intel's infamous ""glued together"" line was just a marketing ploy to try to save their reputation at a time when the business side of the company realized AMD was putting them under serious pressure.

I think Intel probably did have multi die designs in the works, but vastly underestimated the ""cruder"" solution AMD had come up with, or thought they had such a lead that they could take the time to ignore it.",Negative
AMD,"glued together was always ironic given the Q6600 used 2 dual core dies and connected them over the northbridge which yeah is horribly slow but worked good enough at the time.   so gluing chips together wasnt something new, having ryzen use a much faster internal link was a big leap forward but still using serdes is a performance and efficiency hit. makes it that much worse that intel could never capitalize on the drawbacks that will be going away in the future direct connected chiplets.",Negative
AMD,"Intel has always had EMIB since early 2010s, it’s just that the yield and cost efficiency wasn’t where Intel wanted it to be, while AMD opted for a simpler interposer design primarily aimed at cutting costs right at that time. Meaning Intel always had the “right glue” but they just didn’t use it - And by the time they actually got to use it, AMD was already better at the actual application of the concept because they have been playing this game for what, 10 years by now? on a mass scale.",Neutral
AMD,"I guess from intel skunk works development perspective, the crude ""glued together"" comment is true.  But it worked, at scale, and bet Intel to market by years.  And now AMD can play ""catchup"" on the technicalities while still being in the lead generally.  Its only now as moores law kicks in that packaging has to tighten up and becomes so critical, running out of node shrinks ahead.  2 CPU tiles seems overkill,  id love to see a single tile option with x3d  (next tiles/chiplets will move from 8 to 12 CPU anyways),  and even move to a few more ram channels for extra bandwidth, for the local AI crowd, this thing has the capacity, but bandwidth requirements are THIRSTY",Neutral

Even today, we're still seeing the drawbacks with multi-CCD chips. It was a quick and dirty way to get an ""8-core"" CPU out of the gate at a low price, not an optimal or advanced solution by any means.",Neutral

In practice whoever is sour graping about ""glued together"" is likely to have the worse performing chip so they're grasping at straws with which to attack the other team.",Negative
AMD,"You would be right except that Intel actually still had the better performing chip when they were making that criticism, and still held the performance crown in gaming benchmarks up until the X3D series.

When it comes to DRIVER features, AMD only supports the latest or second latest GPUs, they're very horrible with driver support, even when compared to NVIDIA.  Like when they released RSR for only 2 GPUs then NVIDIA released NIS for every GPU still getting driver updates. I really hate this about them to such an extent it's the reason I switched back to NVIDIA.  AMD = Better support for game features  NVIDIA = Better support for driver features  Although I'd argue NVIDIA is only worse at game features because theirs a technical reason for it. We were given ray-reconstruction, reflex 2, and DLSS 4 for every GPU that supports it even though they're really old. Whereas AMD only does so their features are more adopted since their marketshare is small.  Kinda like when AMD said ""we can't provide Anti-Lag+ for non-RDNA 2 GPUs"" with no explanation, then when they had to make it a game feature due to bans they ended up supporting most of their GPUs...

AMD,"AFMF2.1 has less latency than simply rendering one frame ahead, which for games with a cfg/ini/console that permits queue 0 makes it more or less strictly better.  You only hold back the first frame half a frametime plus the framegen time, display frame 1, and then a few ms later the second frame is done (and frame 3 starts) and you can render the gen 1.5 frame and display it, then wait to show frame 2, then frame 3 is done and you cook gen 2.5, etc.  At 60fps base we're talking like 9-10ms latency for 120fps with FG vs 8ms for 120fps natty flip queue 1.

AMD,"Yeah, also couple that current day Nvidia drivers (for the current gen cards) are unstable as hell.  Ever since the 30 series, Nvidia just doesn't really care about making their drivers stable because people will buy their shiny new cards anyway, it's only when they wanna get rid of old stock for the next release that they'll finally give you stable drivers.  You kinda have to pick your poison really, enjoy the GPU now? Or enjoy the GPU in 4 years while you stare at the new gen wanting to buy again anyways.  Though I do half understand RDNA2 not getting as much support, like it's defo capable don't get me wrong, but also comparing it to Nvidia's first gen RTX cards RDNA2 gets the same level of old-gen driver support.   It's probably a bit of laziness too of course, but also it does look like it's at least partially a gen1 RT GPU problem as well.  Though it does look like things are going to get better in the future, 3D rendering programs are switching to modern API's which favour AMD equally to Nvidia, which will hopefully get the ball rolling in terms of AMD's rnd and finally get some healthy competition going again (which would mean lower prices all around, current prices are only so insane because Nvidia has a mini monopoly and so does AMD, whenever the two are actually competing is when we see the largest generational uplifts and the lowest prices).",Negative

AMD,"Never downvoted anyone here. I said, you'd be stupid not to try. I also specifically said it usually doesn'y work well. But when it does, it's awesome.  Frame gen has never affected the quality of my visuals though, only latency. So I'm kinda leaning towards that you are lying. I mean I am fucking tilted on how sure I am that you're lying.",Positive
AMD,"Oh no, you don't see the magic here! Say we have 100fps base for easy math.  You finish frame 1 at time t=0ms   You will finish frame 2 at t=10ms  Say it takes 2ms to make a gen frame.  You wait until t=7ms to show frame 1. (7ms latency)  then at t=10ms you have frame 2 done and immediately begin rendering frame 3 which will be done at t=20ms, and also begin making the gen frame 1.5  at t=12ms you have finished frame 1.5 and you display it immediately  at t=17ms you display frame 2 (7ms later than it was finished)  at t=20ms you finish frame 3 and being working on frame 4 and frame 2.5  at t=22ms you finish frame 2.5 and show it immediately  at t=27ms you show frame 3   etc  -----  so you are only adding 7ms of latency compared to zero renderahead and are actually below the 10ms inherent latency of queueing one frame natty  The AFMF2 framegen lag metric actually maps exactly to this because as far as I know, this is how they do it. How else could they claim less than 1 frametime of latency? They'd have to simply be lying",Neutral
AMD,"You may be right there! It actually lines up better with some of my data, but i didn't consider it in this way.  For example going from 113fps to 452 via quad framegen (DLSS) in a CPU-limited environment, the overlay reports only an additional 4.2ms render latency. That would maybe make sense if the framegen work time was ~1ms.  In GPU-limited environments the latency addition is complicated by the GPU frametime worsening as it dedicates resources to framegen, but in CPU-limited environments you can get flat 2x/3x/4x and the base frametime stays the same. You get a purer measurement of the framegen latency penalty that way.  It is worth a note however that using framegen when GPU-bound can very substantially lower the base framerate and hurt latency that way - both making the frame latency worse, and forcing the framegen process to add more latency to it. It's much less beneficial in GPU-bound environments.",Neutral
AMD,"This is such interesting technology, I appreciate the smart people who develop it so I can enjoy my games with better framerates. FSR4 and DLSS4 are literally magic as well, my Darktide settings were reset without me knowing and I didn't even realize dlss balanced was enabled instead of dlaa until I manually checked.

AMD,Yes! Well there is if you have an Nvidia card! An MS dev created a project called Oasis which replaces the Windows MR stuff that MS removed when they decided to kill everyone's expensive hardware! The Dev has had no luck getting help from AMD so while he got Nvidia cards working us AMD users have been stuck. This looks like a sign that AMD has indeed been working on fixing the road block. It still doesn't actually work on AMD but hopefully now the Oasis Dev can get it working.   I posted the new driver over there. It is worth following the sub for news/updates as things progress.

AMD,"I havent played with it myself yet, but there are threads of people using FSR4 on RDNA2 GPUs on Windows already if that's what you're asking. I have heard there are lots of issues with ghosting though, which are not present on Linux when doing the same thing, so seems to be a driver issue potentially. I too am holding out hope that 6800XT gets FSR4 support because that visual difference is insane, even looking at performance on FSR4 vs quality on FSR3. And as a software engineer I dont see a reason that isn't feasible, but I doubt AMD would put that out (maybe a setting in optional drivers if they did at all).",Neutral

I want to get rid of the 7700XT only because the model i received from Sapphire has been a big issue with coil whine, fan noises and driver issues with the mainboard. It was not eligible for RMA or refund because the card runs games fine most of the time and no issues with Windows 11. Infact Im just waiting to sell it for 280 dollars and use the money to fund a new card",Negative
AMD,Probably unrelated but for HTC Vive I had to disable Motion Smoothing in SteamVR or it will gobble up more and more system RAM making game stutter then eventually crash (Half Life Alyx for example).,Negative

AMD,"Even after using DDU, I still cant get performance tracking to work when I installed 25.9.1. None of the average FPS in my games track, but hours played does.

As such, what's the best process for team Red?      uninstall and purge all remnants process?     clean uninstall option with new one?

AMD,"I only switched to AMD a couple years ago myself (last card was HD4890 from 2009) so I was hesitant to jump myself after being with Nvidia for the better part of 15 years. However, performance and stability have been entirely faultless with my 7900XT.  Anyway, regarding driver updates, I've never had any trouble just installing straight over the top of the existing driver via the Adrenalin interface. It used to be that you just download and run the new version directly from Adrenalin, but at some point in the last few months I've got some AMD Install Manager on my PC that does it instead, so YMMV if you have that or not.  I usually _don't_ perform a clean install (I think the tick box is labelled ""Factory Reset"" on the installer window), but there should be an option to preserve settings/config if you do want to do this. I have done it before and it's kept all of my bindings and stuff.  So yeah, tl;dr DDU is definitely unnecessary IMO. Just download the new version and install over.",Neutral
AMD,"Just DDU's ur older driver and install the new, if you're having problems there's some troubleshoot that u can try, but for only installation use ddu, also you can save ALL your configuration in one document, on the AMD app, everytime you do a DDU, just use that document to put everything of your fan and unvervolt configuration. Also, don't upgrade your driver if you're not having problem.",Neutral
AMD,"It's most likely this given how late this is coming out and there doesn't seem to be a DIY release. Plus, this card has the same hardware cost as the 7800 XT while performing slower than the 9060 XT and 7700 XT. So there's really no reason besides salvage.",Negative
AMD,If they have professional SKUs on the same silicon they may be obligated to keep the production line going and keep accumulating strange bins,Neutral

AMD,"Nah, I'll do someone's earlier comment and just use the clean uninstall on the new driver download",Neutral
AMD,"True, I didn't think of it that way. Professional GPU generations typically have longer periods between new releases I'm pretty sure, so bins that don't work for that use case could also be the reason for this release",Neutral
AMD,"I imagine AMD can get more profit from selling a 7800 XT for 450-500 than a 9060 XT for 370, despite the pricier node. They also may not have the supply to make 9060 XT's to satisfy the entire global market.  This card, however, has the same hardware cost of the 7800 XT while performing slower than the 9060 XT 16GB.

AMD,"Thanks. That explains the new behavior that users are seeing, where the initial step (unlocking) fails to see the device entirely. I need to make that step conditional to GPU. There's another possible issues, where some headsets require a USB command to power the display on.

Plus, 14900K is not a CPU for gaming, it's a CPU for production workloads plus gaming, which makes it noticeably more expensive than 9700X, so realistically we should compare 9700X to 14600K/14700K.",Neutral

Every reviewer I've found just happens to have different results than yours so everyone must be wrong except ""me"" right?  Even if the 14700k is slightly faster it still consumes a lot more power so theres that.  The numbers you can find from reviewers point to the 9700x being around 5 % slower, and you here are talking about 30-40% lul, if it was 30-40% faster it would be faster than a fking 9800x3d lmao.",Negative

AMD,"I sell PC hardware and get to test a wide range of components. I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance. I’ve shown full system specs and game settings every time, and provided more evidence than any tech site or tech YouTuber ever has, yet some people are still in denial.

AMD,"Arrow Lake performs quite well at general compute and power efficiency compared to prior generatons ans even against AMD.  Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU. Ironically the 9070 performance was identical with a 9700X and a 9800X3D.  So it's actually kind of the reverse, gaming reviewers painted Arrow Lake in the worst possible light.",Neutral

AMD,I doubt they would give false numbers. Those are probably what you get with the setup they list in fine print. Also they pretty clearly show the 3dx parts are faster in gaming. But they have probably picked examples that show them in a good light.   There is nothing wrong per se in the arrow lake lineup. In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all. The issue that destroyed the image of arrow lake is that the previous generation was often faster in gaming. That made every reviewer give it bad overall reviews.,Neutral

AMD,"Most commenters are wrong or didn’t read all the articles. Nvidia wants some custom SKUs of server chips to pair with its data center GPUs, and Intel wanted a better solution for pc parts for the GPU tiles.   NVIDIA is NOT getting an x86 license, nor do they want one. In case you haven’t noticed, Nvidia is a $4T company largely on sales of data center GPUs, sales of which were 10x the gaming segment. Profit/earnings ratio of data center is even higher than the 10x.   In my opinion, the only reason for Intel to use RTX chiplets on pc parts is so they can have a few skus for mobile gaming. Lower end laptop chips would still use Xe cores.  This solves NONE of intel’s structural issues - they need, in this order  1. Major foundry customers  2. Regain server market share 3. Data center GPU offerings 4. Move all pc chiplets back to Intel nodes and start to fill up the fabs again",Neutral
AMD,An Intel + nVidia handheld would be something I would welcome just for DLSS4 alone.,Neutral
AMD,"I don’t think it will change that much overall.  It’s no secret that NVIDIA wanted a x86 license for decades now and now they basically got it. This will ""hurt"" AMD by offering competition to markets where AMD currently holds a monopoly like with Strix Halo, most handhelds and consoles.  I don’t think we’ll see big changes on the Intel side.  I don’t think this will affect neither the iGPUs nor ARC because why would it.",Negative
AMD,"this jointventure is NOT about consumer gpu and does not change anythig about gaming gpu of intel, amd or nvidia.  this is instantly obvioiusly from just reading the headlines of the news announcing this.   this tumbnail is just hub using this news to suggest jet another time that maybe amd might just be screwed. they do this because they are neutral in every way.",Negative
AMD,"i think it's bad for us, consumers",Negative
AMD,Was the team up really to crush AMD or Nvidia's answer to enter China?,Neutral
AMD,AMDware unboxed only cares about AMD anyway,Neutral
AMD,This hurts the arc division way more than this could ever hurt amd.,Negative
AMD,They will crush user's wallet,Neutral
AMD,you guys realize Nvidia buys all their stuff from TSMC the same company that makes all of AMD's stuff...So now intel will buy from them too since they cant compete? Because no amount of Intel+Nvidia humping is going to make a TSMC baby...you got to pay to play.,Neutral
AMD,"Even assuming they made monster co-op AMD still has own ecosystem of GPU and CPU, along with consumer support. It's Radeon and Ryzen are still very strong consumer wise. So no, AMD is not screwed",Negative
AMD,Remember Kaby Lake G? No? This will also be forgotten soon.,Negative
AMD,Yes.,Neutral
AMD,Intel partners with UMC of Taiwan the third largest foundry in the world.    What does it mean for UMC and Intel?   How will it affect transfer / exchange of technology between Taiwan and Intel?   How does this affect TSMC position with USAG?,Neutral
AMD,AMDUnboxed on suicide watch.,Neutral
AMD,"For mobile/laptop performance, yes AMD is in the dust, maybe? Makes sense since AMD GPU division is mainly focused on the console partnership with Sony/Microsoft--leaves the mobile platform wide open.",Neutral
AMD,"Who knows, time will tell. But if AMD does find its back against the wall, this is when it does its best. This should be interesting to say the least.",Positive
AMD,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive. I know they have a lot of tricks up their sleeves still, like designing HBM memory onto the die (how Vega was supposed to be originally) and unified memory (soldered down, see the new AI branded chips).",Negative
AMD,Ohh noooerrrrrrrrr,Neutral
AMD,"Actually this may be good for AMD and I will tell you why: Open source drivers. Nvidia if they had a say in intels graphics division would make the intel GPU stuff proprietary and locked down and when support ends its gonna hurt. Meanwhile AMD has open source drivers and in the age that linux is gaining popularity will make it the preferred platform for anyone interested in the growing linux ecosystem. Nvidia will NEED to change how they handle things or intel may not be as attractive as they once were, intel has already suffered a massive knock on thier reputation and this may be the mortal wound that can work in AMD's favor.",Neutral
AMD,"I don't see how this means anything at all for AMD in desktop. This is borderline irrelevant for desktop gaming. Most users pick up an Intel or AMD CPU and an NVIDIA dGPU.  APUs don't really exist in desktop gaming.  In mobile? I think most people won't care much. Intel and AMD APUs both offer compelling and reasonable alternatives for everyday usage. Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.  In all other cases I dont see this being a compelling option.",Neutral
AMD,So either a 200w igpu with a 300w intel cpu or an intel cpu with a 5030 slapped on it?  I think amd will be fine,Neutral
AMD,welcome to the Nvidia and amd duopoly,Neutral
AMD,"I’m really curious what the power efficiency ends up looking like here - mobile performance/W has continued to be very good in recent Intel platforms, and Nvidia is the market leader in that regard among gpu IHVs. But until now, Nvidia chips being intrinsically dGPUs has completely neutered any potential mobile power efficiency or handheld capability - but not anymore if such a thing can be a chiplet/tile! Interesting days ahead…",Positive
AMD,"By that time amd will have already made an FSR4 capbable handheld, so no significant change",Neutral
AMD,"It won’t affect either cause on parts that don’t need a nvidia igpu why raise the price with it when arc igpu is really good as is, maybe for the upper end they will have nvidia but what’s really stopping them from shipping one with an intel arc tile, gives customers more options and nvidia s Option may end up being more expensive",Neutral
AMD,a partnership doesnt mean they get free reign over license lol,Neutral
AMD,"AMD already has the next gen of consoles. Except for the Switch, which NVIDIA already has (with ARM, not with Intel).",Neutral
AMD,"None, It's a way for NVidia to have another product line and stop Intel from having a competitive product line.",Neutral
AMD,"Not to crush amd, but this essentially just kills arc and hurts the consumer market more. You won't be getting any of those 250 dollar 12gb gpus anymore.",Negative
AMD,Why would it?,Neutral
AMD,"It has nothing to do with the dgpu product stack. Nvidia makes very little from the diypc market. Way more comes from prebuilts, laptops and 90+% from data centers and other enterprise use. In a very real way, the arc cards are not a competitor to Nvidia.",Neutral
AMD,"Unfortunately no matter what given Intel's current state the division is going to suffer. Intel cannot afford to invest in products that will take a very long time to generate profit or may never generate profit. If even AMD cannot compete with Nvidia, then Intel will likely never be able too either",Negative
AMD,Past != Future,Neutral
AMD,"nvidia also used to make motherboard chipset, with mixed success.",Neutral
AMD,Arc’s offerings aren’t far behind either.,Neutral
AMD,FSR 4 looks like the later versions of Dlss 2 did,Neutral
AMD,"This ""insignificant change"" we definitely want though.  Competition is good in a stagnant market...",Positive
AMD,"Other than Halo SKU which we are yet to establish any trend of, AMD notoriously drags their feet. RDNA3 will be with us for a while",Negative
AMD,Wont this be targetting the ML workstation space where you have the iGPU with access to >128GB of RAM like Strix Halo with DMA and/or NVLink banswidth?,Neutral
AMD,">maybe for the upper end they will have nvidia but what’s really stopping them from shipping one with an intel arc tile, gives customers more options and nvidia s Option may end up being more expensive  Possibly an overlap like this would be a waste of money developing, and tbh I highly doubt customers would go for the Intel option rather than a Nvidia one, *even if* the Intel option is better performing, because of Nvidia's insane mind share.",Neutral
AMD,Never said that.,Neutral
AMD,Also a way for Nvidia to invest some of their funny money (which is essentially infinite) into a cheap company. Intel under $20 was ludicrous. Intel is still at book value at $29.,Neutral
AMD,Why do so many people think that this will kill ARC?,Negative
AMD,The market for Arc is the same as for Nvidia.,Neutral
AMD,Was that back in the MacBooks having the NVIDIA 9400m paired with a Core2Duo? Those were solid.,Positive
AMD,"No, but it is a reminder on shortcomings to watch out for. The Intel + AMD Partnership with the Intel NUCs several years ago made for some pretty compelling hardware. I still have a NUC8i7HVK in service which works like a champ.  If we are talking about current day NVIDIA with their Discrete Graphics (not the MX budget crap) then their GPUs are obviously smoking anything AMD and Intel. That doesn't resolve some of the Linux problems that still remain with NVIDIA, and that's not going to stop some of the BS NVIDIA does with their hardware around NVENC/NVDEC stream limits. But they have raised those limits, and the open NVIDIA drivers are getting better in time.",Positive
AMD,"Yup. Their nForce boards were great for overclocking, but rather buggy too.",Positive
AMD,"It's not a later version of dlss 2, it's between dlss 3 and 4. Just go watch some videos comparing both.   And btw redstone is coming probably at the end of this year which will improve ray tracing quality and frame gen performance.",Neutral
AMD,"No reputable reviewer thinks that. Most I've seen say it's better than DLSS 3, and very slightly behind DLSS 4.  Why lie about this?",Negative
AMD,They literally haven't said a word about it everyone's just speculating off of Moore's laws anti Intel videos lol consumer is the last thing they care for atm and might be server first cause that makes the most financial sense,Negative
AMD,If they do that in the case the two companies deal fall apart Intel is screwed with no graphics to compete with even the basic amd ones,Negative
AMD,"Well phrased, They now have a seat at the table of Intel to sway votes enough to dissuade them from making competitive products",Neutral
AMD,"Too many people are peeping that MLID podcast. Dude there is very confrontative about his theory that ARC is being ""effectively"" canceled because of some very early roadmap not paying out. Everything is a confirmation bias at this point.   I on the other hand don't get why would Intel forfeit it's competitive advantage with GPU accelerated AI, XeSS or QuickSync and made itself dependant on nVidia. Doesn't make sense especially now, when they have significant influx of cash from both Nvidia and government.",Negative
AMD,"Arc was already not doing well long before. Pouring millions into their gpu division every year with no returns. Their own road maps had their gpus coming out a year sooner but everything got delayed with them resizing the company. Like this deal is not exactly what killed arc, but arc was already struggling beforehand so this was most likely the nail in the coffin.",Negative
AMD,Nvidia does not have an A310 competitor.,Neutral
AMD,But I still remember how many motherboards with Nvidia chipsets I replaced way back.  They used to reliably overheat and need a reflow.  I think it was the HP DV6000 and DV9000 series.,Neutral
AMD,I have not lied,Negative
AMD,"While workstations dont directly contribute a big chunk of the sales, I suspect they dont want to yield their foothold on the ML/Data Science guys.  If they start getting familiar with non-nVIDIA ecosystems, it could mean indirect losses when these guys start procuring non-nVIDIA dGPUs in servers when they do port their workstation experiments to ""larger"" hardware now that AI is all the rage.  B60 is gaining momentum on homelabs, and Strix Halo to some extent getting popular for those needing more memory for their larger datasets.",Neutral
AMD,"MLID has used clickbait trash thumbnails/titles way too many times, no one should watch that garbage channel to begin with.",Negative
AMD,"I think Intel priced in multiple generations of taking losses when they decided to enter the GPU market. Essentially impossible to walk in to a mature duopoly market and immediately start turning profit as a new player, even with Intel's resources.  Of course I think they also had much rosier projections for their other ventures when they started this journey, so who knows if the GPU losses are still tolerable.",Negative
AMD,Intel doesn't have a current gen A310 competitor either.,Neutral
AMD,Theres no way that nvidia is gonna let intel keep producing entry level gpus that directly compete with their own. I know their deals are in regards to apus and to compete with strix halo but nvidia is not gonna invest into a company with a competitor to their gpus. Like a b580 destroys the 5060 and 5050 while costing less or the same amount. There's no way nvidia invests 5 billion without some agreement that kills off arc as long as they are together.,Negative
AMD,Their nForce boards were excellent for overclocking and tinkering! That's for sure. I also remember them being a bit buggy lol.,Neutral
AMD,IIRC that wss the AMD Turion X2 + NVIDIA 7300Go laptops. Those were notorious for dying.   I also remember some budget laptops with the Turion X2 + ATi 3200 chopsrt graphics would die due to graphics desoldering off the board. The GPU would sit at the end of the heatsink and burn up.   The 9400M MacBooks I remember would get hot enough to start leaving powder from the chassis on my desk lol.,Neutral
AMD,"You did tho. It doesn't look like ""later versions of DLSS 2"". Every reputable source has said it's better than DLSS 3 and close to DLSS 4",Positive
AMD,"They're already at 2, going on 3, generations of losses though (Intel discrete GPU's basically have 0 marketshare, even worse than AMD who are also doing really badly) so even if that were true that isn't a reason to be optimistic.  As a company they also seem to be desperate to get income as well and so there is no reason to assume they're going to tolerate that situation for all that much longer.    I doubt they'll entirely kill off their GPU division, they can still do iGPU's which will be good enough and cheaper than paying NV a royalty, but the discrete GPU line is clearly in trouble.",Negative
AMD,A310 is cheap enough and good enough for it's purpose. If it ain't broke why fix it,Positive
AMD,"Wrong man. You just don’t understand how small the diypc market is compared to prebuilts, laptops, and enterprise- it’s a fraction of one percent.",Negative
AMD,The later versions of Dlss 2 look like Dlss 3,Neutral
AMD,Nvidia probably feels the same about their low end SKUs.,Neutral
AMD,"The DIYPC market largely drives the “prebuilt” market, with a 1-3 generation lag.  Many people who buy “prebuilts” have people they go to for advice (i.e. they talk to their friends/family members who DIY). When there’s a big swing in the DIY market, it typically ripples out to the prebuilt market over a few years/generations.",Neutral
AMD,"Lol, what an explanation hahahaha   And that's still not ""better than DLSS 3"" as most say",Negative

AMD,Panther Lake is slipping to Q2 2026 now?    It was originally supposed to launch in Q4 2025,Neutral
AMD,Just hodl until you get the biscuits,Neutral
AMD,"If leak is correct it's bad news.   Panther lake q2 2026, Nova lake q2 2027.    It means 18A will arrive later than TSMC 2N.    Nova lake will likely arrive after Ryzen successors.    Combine that with other performance rumors where there isn't a huge performance uplift. It's bad news.",Negative
AMD,"The dates aren't wrong. As you said, It's the OEM roadmap, and they follow a Q2 release cadence.",Neutral
AMD,Gate All around and Backside power was supposed to be in 2024...  Now it's q2 2026. At this point it's 4N7Y... Which is what we call TSMC cadence.,Neutral
AMD,"why even panther laker when it was only for mobile, cancelled it and just released nova lake next year",Negative
AMD,"This isn't Intel and AMD's road map, this is an ""undisclosed OEM's"" road map.   This doesnt tell us anything about PTL's launch. Just when this OEM will refresh their laptops to have PTL, and its normal for OEMs to launch refreshed models at certain times.   Dell, for example, will usually do Spring, so this may be them. Surface is notorious for being 3 or so quarters after CPU launch.  Look at where MTL is on this schedule, for example. Also around Q2, even though it had been on store shelves technically since the previous year's Q4.  Edit: Looking at the roadmap a second time, this OEM seems to always target a Q2 launch cycle: ADL, RPL, MTL, ARL, PTL, and NVL all follow it. LNL is the only outlier.",Neutral
AMD,I thought Arrow Lake refresh was in the cards for 2025.,Neutral
AMD,Wasn’t Panther Lake going to use TSMC for a portion of the volume?,Neutral
AMD,Yeah I forget to to mention wrong In the sense that it is not Intel CPU Launch OEM roadmap.,Negative
AMD,This entire thing is a mobile roadmap so why are you here?,Negative
AMD,"This ""undisclosed OEM"" is Lenovo by the looks of the font used. Also the timeline makes sense. For example Lunar Lake is shown to be in very late 2024. Lenovo had only one model of Lunar Lake available at that time - the Yoga Aura Edition.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah if it's Surface roadmap, it's a nothing burger.",Neutral
AMD,Yeah some OEMs don't refresh their lineups until the new generation is already launched,Neutral
AMD,I think it was for the iGPU but I don’t remember. I just know the majority of PTL is 18A. I saw a rumor that they were using Intel 3 for the iGPU also so idk.,Neutral
AMD,I also think it's Lenovo. Q2 is when they refresh their ThinkPad line,Neutral
AMD,The 4 Xe3 core iGPU will use Intel 3. The 12 Xe3 core iGPU will use N3E.,Neutral
AMD,"Wonder if Intel will do stacking two bLLCs on a single CPU tile like rumoured as an option with AMD's Zen 6. I iknow this is basically both Zen 5 CCDs having each an 3D v-Cache and NVL seemingly going to have that option now. But two bLLCs meaning 288MBs of stacked cache + cache in compute die would be insane and crazy for gaming.  Regardless I'd love a P Core only RZL SKU with much stacked cache as possible, or heck just 48MB 12P Griffin Cove + 144MB L3 bLLC would be sweet.",Neutral
AMD,"I like how they just throw random words around to pad their ""article"".",Neutral
AMD,The only reason I don't have a dual CCD ryzen is the lack of X3D on the 2nd CCD.  I would 100% be in for a 16 or 24 (when they go 12 core CCD) core dual X3D.,Neutral
AMD,"""leaks""",Neutral

AMD,"Considering the latency is not even expected to be any good with BLLC, AMD is seemingly quite a careful opponent for Intel indeed",Negative
AMD,Scared of their rumor?  Lets release our rumor!,Neutral
AMD,I don't think 2x bLLC could fit on the package. Sounds like nonsense to me.,Negative
AMD,it seems as if right now the best option for consumers is to just build a cheap 1700 or AM4 system and call it a day for the next 4-5 years or so. but that's just me,Neutral
AMD,"My god.  The only reason huge caches benefit gaming, is to benefit rushes to shipment by the publisher, so that game engineers either don't have to optimize, or they can use garbage like Unity, or both.  This is going to make so many mediocre developers better... except no it won't.  It'll just get the market flooded with more garbage.  Also... diminishing returns, and I doubt AMD will put this in Zen 5 -- seems like a trash rumor, to me.",Negative
AMD,"3D cache will eventually become full of assets and dip, if and onlyif IMC is bottlenecked by random memory access.  - the ability for cache to transfer data from memory, to IMC, to cache has a FPS hit (cache hit-rate). This is due to the bottleneck of a chiplet-based IOD: compromising memory latency with cache hit-rate. Eventually the cache fills and relying on IMC to feed the cores anyway.  You can easily test this by monitoring 1% lows and increasing memory latency (lowering DDR4 B-die clocks/DDR5 hynix and increasing timings) to see how Cache holds up when full of assets while memory is being bottlenecked-   What games need is 10-12 P-Cores and an IMC capable of high speeds. Within a monolithic die to reduce relying on cache hit-rate and IOD chiplet bottlenecks.",Neutral
AMD,This is all they needed to sell for gaming again and yet they gave us all the e cores no one asked for jfc.,Negative
AMD,bLLC is not stacked cache,Neutral
AMD,What do you consider random? The article was perfectly clear.,Neutral
AMD,Do you have a specific application in mind? I thought two CCDs with 3D cache would still face the same issues if the app tries to use cores across CCDs.,Neutral
AMD,Some rumors of 16-core dual X3D chip actually surfaced yesterday...,Neutral
AMD,"They would have trouble fitting just 1 bLLC onto a package, 2 bLLC might only be viable for something like a server chip with a much larger socket.   It may be possible once Intel starts 3D stacking they're CPUs though, but we have to wait and see.",Negative
AMD,Yeah. Definitely just you,Neutral
AMD,You could literally make that claim with any CPU performance increase.,Neutral
AMD,Speak for yourself. Skymont ecores have raptor lake IPC. We need more of those,Neutral
AMD,"What CPU do you have? If its Zen 4 or slower, your cores are same or weaker than Arrowlake E cores in IPC",Neutral
AMD,This is correct. Stacked cashe comes later. I'd say around 1 to 2 years after. And that comes with stacked cores as well if they go with that path.,Neutral
AMD,"Correlating asset pop in with memory latency is utterly nonsensical.   Edit: Lmao, blocked.  Also, to the comment below, the creator of that video clearly has no clue what there're talking about. There's no ""bottleneck between cache and memory"" with v-cache. The opposite, if anything.

AMD,"> I thought two CCDs with 3D cache would still face the same issues if the app tries to use cores across CCDs.  It does, but i'd rather every core be equal in terms of per-core cache in a local sense.

AMD,Yea but I’m not paying for e cores that are barely faster than my current skylake cores. I just want p cores only.,Negative
AMD,"IPC is just 1 factor  Zen 4 clocks much higher, and got a far superior low latency caching subsystem   No one sane thinks that Skymont can actually beat Zen 4 in most workloads Only if you downclock Zen 4... and guve it slow ram to increase latency",Neutral
AMD,"Now pay attention to the memory bottleneck of chiplet IMC architectures on x3d chips:P https://youtu.be/Q-1W-VxWgsw?si=JVokm7iLScb7xynU&t=700  This simple 1% lows test indicates how texture-pop can impact frametime, directly. Since assets are first stored in memory, then fed to cache, any bottleneck between Cache - to memory will cause delays when loading asset thus 1% FPS... measured temporally(in this case).",Neutral
AMD,The bad optimisation critics aremostly people trying to sound smart by rambling things they dont understand.  Game engines are very optimized these days.   Its funny they mostly pick on Unreal Engine 5 as the prime example... That is probably the most complete game engine out there. So naturally its hard to make all that stuff work well togetter... They have litterally some of the best coders and researchers in the business ... Id love to see you do a better job.,Negative
AMD,Mixed cores are awesome if the scheduler would do what i want and there lies the problem and i dont think even AI can solve that yet.,Negative
AMD,"I said IPC of Zen 4 is the SAME and weaker than Zen 4 is weaker than Skymont in IPC. No more no less. As for clocks, the core scales to max 5.2ghz (default 4.6ghz), certainly overall slower than Zen 4. IPC is a comparison about throughput at a given clockspeed. Its a give to compare you will need to match the clocks.  Funny you you should mention latencies, considering that core to core (even accross clusters), latencies of Skymont are better than Lion Cove? So if latency is the issue, it has nothing to do with Skymont and everything to do with the trash uncore they have based on the Meteorlake SOC. Even workstation Crestmont on a different package performs better. Furthermore skymont IPC is measured based on Arrowlake. Arrowlake is worse latency than Raptorlake and Zen already. Latencies have been accounted for.",Negative
AMD,"I play Warthunder almost daily. It’s ridiculously fucking optimized.   I got cyberpunk when it came out, it was a shit show. Elden ring? Mediocre.  Escape from tarkov? Fucking laughable.  Call of duty? 500 terabytes. Besides this small list,  I’ll wait for battlefield 6 (which by the way also has a history of releasing unoptimized)  The one thing I will say is that developers do work hard after releases to optimize their games.

AMD,"It's very specific scenarios where this can unlock new performance, most games it won't do anything or even lower performance.     So they can't *really expand it* since it's an uncommon scenario. That's why we have so few games that benefit from it.",Negative
AMD,Never count out Intel. They have some very talented people over there.,Negative
AMD,"Regarding the cache optimizations you pointed out, I have a question. Can you test all APO supported games you own and capture the utilization of the E-cores ?  My understanding is that Intel is keeping 1 E-core per cluster active and parking the remaining 3 E-cores. So the lone E-core of each cluster has full access to the 4mb shared L2. For the i9 they can have 4 such solitary E-cores that have their own cache and hence do not touch the L3 cache. The 4 E-cores handle background task while the 8 P-cores with the full 36mb L3 cache deal with the games.  Please correct me if I am wrong.  Also, what cpu cooler do you use ?",Neutral

AMD,How is this doing the game developers work?,Neutral
AMD,"It's updated as far as I know, but not for every platform.  If you're on Arrow Lake you have the new games that were added, but if you're still on Raptor Lake then you only have the original titles.

AMD,"They have added a few new games, but it appears you need to have Arrow Lake to be able to apply APO on them which is BS!  They need to have a better system than this.

AMD,The intel software team is pure black magic when they allowed to work on crack.,Neutral
AMD,"Here is a screenshot showing CPU activity across all cores.  This is with HT disabled BTW, and the cooler is an Id FROZN A720.

I know they've added some games for Arrow Lake (like Cyberpunk, Baldur's Gate 3) but those games still aren't available yet for the 14900K     [https://imagizer.imageshack.com/v2/3528x1985q90/923/hh8Guk.png](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/v2/3528x1985q90/923/hh8Guk.png)",Neutral
AMD,"Raptor Lake isn't getting new games for APO.  Which strikes me as greedy, since I'm sure it would work fine. Intel originally said that APO wouldn't work at all on 13th gen, which turned out to be completely false.",Negative
AMD,"When combined with Nova Lake's bLLC, it could give Intel a major edge over AMD's X3D.       And yeah, limiting it to certain games and certain CPUs is a real downer for the technology, so hopefully Intel can find a way to streamline and expand it when Nova Lake launches.",Positive
AMD,"AFAIK, it's recommended to use Balanced mode for proper use of the efficiency cores if you have a Raptor Lake or Arrow Lake CPU",Neutral
AMD,Balanced in full load will just do the same thing as High Performance.,Neutral
AMD,"It's capable of a few things, but the main mechanism from what I've seen is that it temporarily disables three out of four cores in each E-core cluster by forcing them into the lowest power state. The result is that the remaining active core has access to each cluster's full L2 cache (2MB on 12th-gen, 4MB on 13th/14th-gen). L2 cache isn't shared with P-cores (L3 is global), so this can really minimize E-core cache evictions before they're forced into slower memory, and games do love themselves some cache.  It's a genuinely clever way of maximizing available resources and I really wish they'd allow user control over its features, but it seems to be pretty tightly leashed to/by the team that developed it. It obviously wouldn't benefit every situation, such as particularly low/high thread occupancy situations, but it's pretty rough to have the option tied to quarterly updates for one or two specific games.",Neutral
AMD,Or... Just process lasso.,Neutral
AMD,Because it’s optimizations on how it can efficiently use the cpu.,Neutral
AMD,Must the App be downloaded? Or it's automatic after installing the PPM and DTT drivers?,Neutral
AMD,"All of this stuff is super situational. For when it’s supported for my 14th G, I love it.  To call it better than X3D though? That’s a bit much.",Positive
AMD,They are they came up with ML for their upscaller before the red team did and even better than FSR as a dump upscaler and they also did a good RT implementation. But the hardware still has raw horse power issues and they already use a big die for what it can do.  In the 80's or they shammed The DEC Alpha team on subnormal floating point operations with the 8087 FPU. Intel was doing way more precession without having to round so earlier on a consumer FPU while the Alpha CPU was a Mainframe one. Intel also gave it up to help estandardize the way CPUs handle floating point types.  Intel compilers were also black magic becuase they optimized so much C and C++ for Intel specifically but there was always controversy causeless AMD x86 couldn't take part of those optimizations,Neutral
AMD,Were there any background tasks running when the screenshot was captured ? I want to see how the E-cores are assigned for the background tasks under APO.,Neutral
AMD,In certain games. It's not universal at all. There would be scenarios where it gets an edge but if AMD is pushing as hard as rumors state they may still have the better CPUs overall.,Neutral
AMD,"Great explanation that makes sense!  It definitely has to do with the cache, that much is true.   A Raptor Lake CPU with 8 P cores and no efficiency cores, with 36MB of L3 would perform exceptionally well in games.   But the efficiency cores have their uses as well in highly parallel tasks.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah it's a pretty cool, yet simple idea. It would be really nice to give users more granular control natively.",Positive
AMD,Are the e cores clustered in order so we would be able to manually achieve this with process lasso?,Neutral
AMD,Why should game devs be automatically expected to specifically optimize their game for specific architectures of Intel's CPUs? It's not on them to do so.,Negative
AMD,You need to download the Intel Application Optimization app from the Windows store,Neutral
AMD,"I never said it was better than X3D, only that it is useful as a foil.       Remember that Nova Lake will have bLLC, which is the answer to X3D.  But in conjunction with APO, it may give Intel the edge and help them regain the gaming crown in the next cycle provided they can streamline and expand the technology.",Positive
AMD,"Actually, it is better than X3D in almost every GPU/CPU combo where the GPU throttles. Intel 14th gen almost universally wins 1% lows and frequently FPS - almost universally in 4k gaming, but as I said, when the GPU throttles at any resolution, which is almost always, Intel wins.",Positive
AMD,"Eh, they're very good but they benefited vastly from AMDs mistakes and the lessons learned from it. Remember AMD didn't have any ai hardware for their first 2 gens on RDNA and RDNA 3 didn't have enough for FSR4 either. It's not that intel were better at producing a ML upscaler. They just had the hardware for it from the get go so they could implement it quicker.  They did make Xess though which is miles ahead of FSR 3 even on AMD systems (on average. FSR3 is pretty good when modded and can be competitive) so they do have some extremely talented people there. I hope they fund them properly and don't go the AMD route of having Ryzen and Radeon not work together due to pride.",Positive

AMD,"You need to enable it in the BIOS, me ale sure the DTT driver is installed and then download the app from the Windows 11 store",Neutral
AMD,"Which they already do, and are often overworked and underappreciated for.   But sure, it's their fault they didn't optimize the game even more for a subset of already relatively high end CPUs....",Negative
AMD,"You are massively oversimplifying. A lot of games that support APO, like Metro Exodus EE OP used as an example, were released before Intel released CPUs with P and E cores. Expecting studios to rework and optimize old games for new CPUs is very naive.",Negative
AMD,"They should be focusing on optimizations that help the vast majority of all CPUs, especially older/lower end ones.   It's not their job to specifically help one companies latest CPU architectures because they couldn't figure out how to create a core that has both good area and performance.",Negative

AMD,Thanks a lot.,Positive
AMD,> i am not talking about older games. i am talking about newer games.... really dude?  New games seldom have problems with P and E cores. That is why if you took at minute to look at games that APO support you would notice almost all were released before 2022 before release of Alder lake CPUs. Because older P and E unaware games struggle. Don't really dude me if you are this clueless.,Negative
AMD,"APO includes specific optimizations made for specific Intel skus, not general optimizations that help pretty much all processors.",Neutral
AMD,That is not true whatsoever. Games do not properly utilize the p and e cores and unreal 5 is very known for this.,Negative
AMD,Ok…? If there is a specific problem then they need to optimize it for that hardware. Literally a devs job. Still don’t get your thought process,Negative
AMD,"Dude, Unreal 5 runs like crap on pretty much all hardware. It stutters on AMD and nVidia graphics. Unreal 5 doesn't count.",Negative
AMD,"There isn't a specific problem, it still works lol, just not as well as it could on a specific architecture.   They shouldn't be wasting their finite resources/time on optimizing specifically for an already relatively high end and well performing architecture, but rather attempting more generalized optimizations that help all users.   It really shouldn't be too hard to understand.",Neutral
AMD,"Very cool. Cheers Intel! As a 6900XT owner, I use Xess whenever it's available. The DP4A version got very solid once V1.3 hit.  Hopefully more devs implement it.",Positive
AMD,"I like how Intel still support DP4A model. My meteor lake chip gonna love this XeSS2 with FG and LL.  Meanwhile Amd give middle finger to their consumer who don't have radeon 9000 series, FSR4 doesn't works at all on their previous GPU including the flagship rx 7000 series.",Positive
AMD,Did the DP4A version also improve from 1.3 to 2.0?,Neutral
AMD,"I thought it was a mix of both shader model 6.4+ and DP4a, not either or",Neutral
AMD,Okay but why would I want to use that instead of NVIDIA DLSS?,Neutral
AMD,It’s the least you should get after not getting FSR4.,Negative
AMD,You'd use it over FSR if that's available too?,Neutral

AMD,"I don't want to defend AMD, but 7000 series lacks the FP8 instruction to hardware accelerate FSR4.   On Linux they managed to emulate it using the FP16 instruction, which is available on RDNA3, but it seriously impacts performance and introduces 1,5ms of input latency, compared to the 0,5/0,8ms of latency on RDNA4 with hardware FP8.",Negative
AMD,And they expect people who bought previous RDNA to buy more RDNA,Neutral
AMD,Not by a significant amount.,Negative
AMD,DP4a only relevant for intel igpus as its crpss vendor locked by intel. Other gpus only get the Shader Model 6.4 version.,Neutral

AMD,It's great news for gpu that can't use dlss because fsr3 is a blurry shitfest.,Positive
AMD,"I mean it gives better image quality than FSR 3.1, so I know I definitely do.",Positive
AMD,Sure. The image quality is generally better. I'd only use FSR if I was trying to squeeze every last drop of performance out of my GPU since it's faster than Xess DP4a. But Xess will be tried first.,Positive
AMD,Do you have a link? Anything I have seen points to the GPU using Xess DP4A unless it's an ARC GPU. So it supports RDNA2 and newer on AMD and Turing and newer on Nvidia.  https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-xess-compatibility-nvidia-amd/  And I do literally run Xess on my 6900XT (currently using it for F7 Rebirth through Optiscaler). So if I'm not running Xess DP4a then what am I running?,Neutral
AMD,">I don't want to defend AMD, but 7000 series lacks the FP8 instruction to hardware accelerate FSR4   Sure, but they can make FSR4 for non hardware accelerated like Intel right? FSR 3.1 is so bad even when compared to Intel XeSS 1.3 DP4A, but Amd refuse to improve it because they want to force people to buy radeon 9000 series.",Negative
AMD,"Amd really all in when it comes to copying Nvidia. Guess what? The more you buy, the more you save!",Neutral
AMD,DP4a is cross vendor.   XMX is Arc only.,Neutral

The article you linked is from 2021, in early 2022 intel cross vendor locked DP4a. The main article of the post clearly states Shader Model 6.4.",Neutral
AMD,where did amd touch you bud?,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah more and more games are adding DLSS support, so I'm not sure when I would need Xess",Neutral
AMD,"That's true but in edge cases where even the lightest Xess option is still too heavy, FSR may still deliver a better overall experience.   E.g. CP2077 on the steam Deck in Dog Town. When I was testing some stuff out (trying to see how close I could get my Deck to the Switch 2 build) I found Xess to be a unsuitable. Even on the lightest Xess mode, the performance hit was a bit too noticeable. FSR doesn't look as good as Xess but it runs better and you can get away with a bit more upscaling artifacting on the Decks relatively small screen. Just rendering at a lower res and letting the screen upscale was also a solid option in that scenario.  As I say though, that's an edge case where you really just need outright speed. If your GPU doesn't support DLSS or FSR4 then using Xess makes sense in the vast majority of cases.",Neutral
AMD,Are you sure you're not getting the DP4A/Shader Model 6.4 and Arc exclusive version mixed up? DP4a was added to Shader Model 6.4. https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki/Shader-Model-6.4.  There is a separate path of Xess that is better than DP4A but that only works on Arc Cards.,Neutral
AMD,"It's good to see finally Intel working with game developer to bring optimization to Intel platform. This time not only optimization for Arc GPU, but also for Intel Core CPU like proper CPU scheduling for P and E cores to make sure the game runs on the right thread.  I think this also the reason why they never update APO game support again. Obviously optimizing their platform by working directly with game developer is better than doing it by themself.

AMD,"Most games are optimized for consoles which are natively eight cores, and a lot are ported over to PC and so you basically need eight fast cores in whatever CPU you happen to have, and the rest don't really do much. That's why Intel HEDT and AMD's Threadripper aren't of much use in this regard.",Neutral

AMD,Most likely the bLLC variant wil be single compute tile and single cache tile as this would be cheaper for now than putting bLLC cache in base tile like Amd did. They can do that when 18A-PT is avaliable which will probably be after Nova Lake goes into production with 18A or maybe 18A-P,Neutral

AMD,fym no different they're 50% faster,Neutral
AMD,No. ARL architecture is definitely not optimized for latency but hiding memory access which favours multithreading instead of gaming. Hopefully Nova Lake will optimize all the latecy issues with ARL arch and decrease latency to L3 considerably aswell,Negative
AMD,"Yes, but in games, it's the P-cores that are meant to be utilized. Also, more than eight cores or 16 threads aren't really necessary for gaming. The 9950x3d isn't faster, than the 9900x3d.  My point is that the space taken up by the E-cores could instead be used for additional cache, not?",Neutral
AMD,I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it. Anyhow if that's true the large L3 should be even more helpful for things like gaming as it will keep those higher latency hits down.

AMD,What issue did you run into with a 9800x3d? It has one CCD and no small cores,Neutral
AMD,"Nowadays there are very few cases where disabling E cores is extremely beneficial, sometimes they are a detriment to performance but more often than not they are useful. Not to mention the E core design team is more competent than the P core team and are quickly catching up in performance.    The E cores in Alder Lake had relatively poor ST performance but in Arrow Lake they are much faster and closer to the P cores in raw performance. Every new generation the gap keeps shrinking and it will make the disabling of E cores less and less relevant.    Sometimes the Windows scheduler will wrongly assign an E core to a ST bound task, even if a P core is available, but it doesn't happen often enough to be a serious issue.",Neutral
AMD,"yes, but not because of windows scheduling - its because you can OC higher with them off - better temps and easier stability - some people disable HT for the same.",Neutral
AMD,They don't pay attention,Negative
AMD,"No. Intel needs to do what Amd did and add seperate bLLC just for gaming. As long as latency is reduced to the L3 cache including bLLC, gaming performance will definitely increase as 285K and 9950x have similar performance in both gaming and productivity with small lead going to Amd.

Do you have a source, where they directly claim the NVL cores are coming from TSMC?",Neutral
AMD,"The game is a dumpster fire when it comes to CPU utilization, it hammers even top tier gaming chips like the 9800X3D. I'm not surprised if the E cores can bottleneck the performance even further, most likely some of the game's heaviest threads get (wrongly) assigned to the E cores.    The scheduling in W11 has been significantly improved over the last few years but it's not 100% perfect either. Legacy software in particular, which typically utilizes 1 core, often ends up running in an E core and as a result you can't take advantage of the higher ST performance a P core provides. In that case you need stuff like Process Lasso to fix the problem. It doesn't happen very often but when it does it's very annoying.",Negative

AMD,"Wonder what node such a product, if it does exist, would use for the iGPU tile.   AFAIK, rumor is that the iGPU tile for the standard parts would be on 18A or an 18A variant. However, if this is a flagship part, I would assume they would be willing to pay the extra cost to use N2...   However that would also presumably involve porting the architecture over to another node, which I don't think Intel has the resources, or wants to go through the effort, to do so.   Also wonder if such a product will finally utilize the ADM cache that has been rumored since like, forever.   And this is a bit of a tangent, but I swear at this point in the leak cycle for a new Intel product, there's always usually a ton of different skus that are leaked that may or may not launch - right now we have NVL bLLC, NVL standard, and now this, and a bunch of them end up not launching (whether they were cut internally, or the leaks were just made up).

If you only make a few, those costs get concentrated on what you do make.  Low volume also means a single defect is promotionally more of your possible units, and hits the margins harder. You do get more total defects in a larger run, but at sufficiently high quantities of those defects, you start making lower bins to recover some of the defects. If you hardly make the volume to cover one widespread SKU, you aren't likely to have enough to make a cheaper one with any degree of availability.

AMD,"Even though it's not stacked, I believe it's still going to fix the last level cache latency issue MTL and ARL have.   Ryzen CPUs have lower L3 latency than Intel because each CCX gets their own independent L3, unlike Intel's shared L3. Now in NVL, the BLLC configuration will replace half of the P-core and E-core tiles with L3, so possibly giving the existing cores/tiles their own independent L3, improving latency and bandwidth over shared L3.  But one thing intrigues me. If this cache level has lower latency than shared L3, wouldn't this more properly be called L2.5 or something below L3 rather than last level cache? Will NVL even still have shared L3 like the previous Intel CPUs? I know the rumor that it will have shared L2 per two cores, but we know nothing of the L3 configuration.",Neutral

AMD,Well it was a downgrade on system snappiness as intel have way higher random reads than amd.,Neutral
AMD,> I mean 9800x3D and 14900K offers basically the same performance  LMAO,Neutral
AMD,"Huh? 9800x3d is universally known to be like 20-25 percent faster, even in 1 percent lows.   https://www.techspot.com/review/2931-amd-ryzen-9800x3d-vs-intel-core-14900k/",Neutral
AMD,Maybe that is your experience.  Neverthelesss if you compare most gamers who switched to 9800x3D they report a significantly noticeable uplift in fps and 0.1 fps. Maybe a negligible few reported a decrease. And this has very likely nothing to do with the x3D CPU but other causes.,Neutral
AMD,"Ah you’re missing the final piece. As far as i’m aware this pretty much requires controlling the OS as well (or at least solid OS support). Consoles get their own custom operating system, Apple built a new version of MacOS for M chips. Intel and AMD though don’t control windows.",Neutral
AMD,UMA is such a hassle That's why I don't see it much except for calculation purposes (HPC/AI)...,Negative
AMD,"Application developers are supposed to try to avoid copies from GPU memory to CPU memory, instead letting it stay in the GPU memory as much as possible",Neutral
AMD,">so there is still the cost of useless copies between system RAM vs allocated GPU ram.    There is none, AMDGPU drivers have supported GTT memory since forever, so static allocation part is just to reduce burden for app developers but if you use GTT memory you can do zero-copy CPU+GPU hybrid processing.",Negative
AMD,"Intel needs something decent because AMD has taken a page out of intel (up to gen7) playbook, same cores no changes. Intel now provides more cores but it's the 100% core increase Vs AMD 50% and bLLC that should shake things up, hopefully they keep the temperature down as I don't want to have to replace case and get a 360mm rad just to not throttle, and not ever again do a 13th and 14th gen degradation show.   If all goes well going back to intel for a few years then AMD, brand loyalty is for suckers, buy what's best for performance and value. Hopefully intel i5 has 12P cores and i7 18-20P cores that would be nice to have",Neutral
AMD,"bLLC is just a big-ass L3$ and since Intel does equal L3 slices per coherent ring stop, it'll be 6\*12 or 12\*12 with each slice doubling or quadrupling. The rumor is 144MB so quadrupled per slice, probably 2x ways and 2x sets to keep L3 latency under control.",Neutral
AMD,"Intel and AMD have effectively the same client L3 strategy. It's only allocated local to one compute die. Intel just doesn't have any multi-compute die parts till NVL.   > Now in NVL, the BLLC configuration will replace half of the P-core and E-core tiles with L3  8+16 is one tile, in regardless of how much cache they attach to it",Neutral
AMD,It is a massive issue for amd. You're voltage limited like crazy as electron migration kills the 3D cache really fucking fast. 1.3V is already dangerous voltage for the cache.,Negative
AMD,"I still think there's a slight impact (the 9800x3d only boosts up to 5.2GHz vs the 5.5GHz of the 9700x), but compared to Zen 4, the issue does seem to have been lessened, yes.   And even with Zen 4, the Fmax benefit from not using 3D V-cache using comparable skus was also only single digits anyways.",Neutral
AMD,"Adamantium was always rumored to be an additional L4 cache IIRC, and what Intel appears to be doing with NVL is just adding more L3 (even though ig Intel is calling their old L3 the new L4 cache? lol).   I don't think Intel can also build out Foveros-Direct at scale just yet, considering they are having problems launching it for just CLF too.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm an e-core hater but arrow lake e-cores are really performant and make up for the loss of HT. arl/nvl 4+8 would wildly beat 6c12t adl/rpl.  HT was always a fallacy anyway. If you load up every thread, your best possible performance is ~60% of a core for a games main-thread.  I would much rather pin main-thread to best p-core in a dedicated fashion and let the other cores handle sub threads. Much better 1% lows if we optimize for arrow lake properly (still doesn't hold a candle to 9800X3D with HT disabled though).",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, I somewhat agree with this. I suppose it depends if Intel’s latency problem with their P+E core design is at all a fixable one - 4c/8t is still shockingly serviceable for gaming, but 4c/4t absolutely is not.",Neutral
AMD,It's the same ratio as 285K 8P+16E vs AMD 16P and we know that 285K is competitive despite no hyperthreading,Neutral
AMD,"Sooo a few months ago, I helped a buddy of mine troubleshoot a black screen issue on his newly built 9800X3D and RTX 5090 rig, a fairly common issue with Nvidia’s latest GPUs.  While working on his PC, I'd notice a series of odd and random hiccups. For example, double clicking a window to maximize it would cause micro freezes. His monitor runs at 240Hz, and the cursor moves very smoothly, but dragging a window around felt like it was refreshing at 60Hz. Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.  I did my due diligence on his AMD setup: updated the BIOS and chipset drivers, enabled EXPO profile, made sure Game Bar was enabled, set the power mode to Balanced. Basically, all the little things you need to do to get the X3D chip to play nice and left.  But man... I do not want to ever be on an AMD system.",Neutral
AMD,did they measure responsiveness and timed the click to action? and was it significantly different? how much difference are we talking about?,Neutral
AMD,"can you explain exactly what you're talking about here? are you talking about a situation where the system needs to do random reads from an ssd? aka: boot time, initial game load time?",Neutral
AMD,"How was ""system snappiness"" measured?",Neutral
AMD,No.,Neutral
AMD,"Now both AMD and Intel chips are “disaggregated “ which means between cpu and other agents like memory controllers, pcie, and storage there is higher latency than the 12/13/14th gen parts. AMD has higher latency due to the larger distances involved on the package.  Also Intel is not really improving the CPU core much. There won’t be a compelling reason to upgrade from a 14700 until DDR6 comes out. At least not in desktop. Nova lake high cache parts will cost $600 or more so value/dollar will be low.",Negative
AMD,So? Major upgrade for everything else,Neutral
AMD,"I had an 12600 not k. I had the opposite experience, I upgraded to a 7800x3d and the snappiness was a night and day upgrade. I can recommend a x3d to anyone. Pair that cpu with Windows 11 IoT LTSC and you have a winner <3",Positive

AMD,"""Enthusiast Segment"" my good sir. All the benches you see are poorly configured or stock 14900K. With tuning it's a different story. Intel craptorlake scales with fast ram.",Neutral
AMD,"As a long time AMD user I know that Intel needs to be tuned to perform best. So when you tune the 14900K or even 285K you get like 20% performance uplift vs stock. X3D just performs great out of the box because of the huge L3 Cache. At the very least if you do not like microstutters or frame drops and want consistent gaming performance Intel 14th gen is superior vs current AMD's offering. Anyone with a specific board like Apex, Lightning, Tachyon, or even Gigabyte Refresh boards + i7/i9 13-14th gen with decent memory controller can achieve similar gaming experience. I'm speaking from experience since I also have a fully tuned 9950x3D/5090 on my testbench. For productivity task Intel feels much better to use as well. I feel like Intel is just better optimized for Windows and Productivity too.",Positive
AMD,"Actually Intel thermal is already better than Amd ever since Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake released. Even Core Ultra 7 258V is arround 10c cooler than Amd Z2E and Strix Point on the same watt.   On MSI Claw 8 AI+, Lunar Lake temp at 20w is just arround 62c while the Amd version is arround 70c. I wouldn't have a doubt Nova Lake and Panther Lake will also have good thermal because it will have 18A node with BPD and RibbonFET GAA which is more advance than traditional silicon when it comes to power delivery and efficiency.",Positive
AMD,Ah so bLLC on both tiles is a possible configuration? Any chance Intel actually goes for this?,Neutral

Desktop side, AMD 7000 is a hot mess, like seriously ridiculous. Seems that was sorted on 9000,    Let's wait and see on nova lake and zen6, like I said, brand loyalty is stupid, bought into AM5, so it's cheaper for me to go for zen6 with 244Mb of L3, but no am6-7 that will be intel.",Negative

I looked online for a few moments and found:  (1) Buildzoid from actually hardcore  overlocking did a 12 hour live stream where they couldn't even get a 8000 mhz overclock stable on the 14900k. No wonder why people haven't benched this lol  https://www.youtube.com/live/bCis9x_2IL0?si=ht3obVoBLcRFCyXI  (2) Plenty of benchmarks where an overclocked 9800x3d is about 10 percent faster than an overclocked 14900k with 7600 ddr5,Neutral

AMD,"That channel has a lot of videos and even on this specific video it would help if you point the specific time you're referring to.  Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.  So by virtue of their fast memory Macs are easily 3x to 8x faster than PC on LLMs.  The rest is quite different though which is why what benchmark is important.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm highly suspicious, for packaging reasons if nothing else. I'm not going to call it impossible, but that would put enormous strain on the X dimension. Think about it, it's something on the order of 3-4x what the socket was originally for.  And obviously goes without saying, but MLID ""very high confidence"" doesn't mean shit.",Negative
AMD,"Based on my own testing , the games I play and benchmark results. Bullzoid is not relevant to this conversation. You can keep downvoting me for speaking the truth it's okay. I can't blame you because youtube and mainstream techspot are 99% misinformation. If you believe 9800x3D is 30% faster then go buy it, nobody is stopping you. I have investments with AMD and you're doing me a favor by supporting them.",Neutral
AMD,Just to be clear compute and hardware support for things like tensor cores have a massive impact. HBM is king but on older cards like the mi100 (released five years ago) can be out paced by a mid range card like the 4070.

AMD,"Besides, UMA wasn't first developed by Apple. Even if Intel introduces it, the software side or the software framework… Moreover, the OS side has to deal with it, so it is necessary to consider it a little. That's what you said earlier",Neutral
AMD,"I take no side there. I'm a dev, I want my code to be the fastest on all platforms  I have: - M4 Max so I can optimize on ARM and MacOS - Ryzen 9950X so I can optimize with AVX512 - in the process of buying an Intel 265K so I can tune multithreaded code to heterogeneous architecture.  The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough. So I expect the next-gen CPUs (Zen 6 and Nova Lake) to be quad-channel by default (~200GB/s with DDR5) so they are at least in the same ballpark as M4 chip (but still 2x slower than M4 Pro and Max).  I also expect more soldered LPDDR5 builds in the coming year.",Neutral

I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.  The whole experience is proving to be awful, time consuming, feels like it should be illegal and has completely put me off ever using Intel again, or recommending it to anyone I help spec builds for.",Negative
AMD,"Hi, I have a Lenovo Ideapad with an Intel CPU and Intel GPU.  I find Windows font rendering unreadably faint.

[Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.   Since you've already tried the obvious stuff like BIOS reset and driver rollbacks, you're probably looking at a Windows service or background process gone rogue. Keep me posted on what you find with that CPU usage spike and reliability monitor - those are likely our smoking guns!",Neutral
AMD,"u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  You're absolutely correct about VROC on X299 being discontinued. Intel moved VROC for X299 platforms into sustaining mode within the past two years and has shifted focus toward Intel RST (Rapid Storage Technology) for consumer applications. While VROC is no longer actively developed, it remains supported in sustaining mode for existing users, which means NVMe drives that were released during VROC's active development period (roughly 2017-2022) should still function properly. However, newer drives may work but won't receive official validation or certification. For anyone building new systems, Intel recommends using RST instead of VROC, but existing X299 users can continue using VROC with supported drives from the qualified vendor list. ***Support is now limited to sustaining mode with no new features or drive certifications planned, as confirmed in the support article you referenced.***",Neutral

AMD,I guess you are the only one who is having trouble on that part. I mean I haven't seen anyone get mad about it. So I don't really seem to find any fault I mean it is their preventive measure for fake processors that are out there. Just ask for some help to take a picture it's not that hard,Negative
AMD,"I think you should revert the Gpu setting to default. Then start changing some settings in the Microsoft setting. There are settings for fonts, brightness, and such. There is also some setting for the smoothness of the animation in the Windows",Neutral
AMD,I suggest getting a replacement if the issue is the same. But make it sure you update your bios first to the latest version and set it to intel default settings.,Neutral
AMD,"u/Tagracat I’m okay to proceed with a replacement if the recommendation has already been tried and you're still experiencing the same issue.  Just let me know if you're good to move forward, and I’ll send you a personal message to help facilitate a possible RMA.",Neutral
AMD,"u/Maleficent_Apple4169 NVMe drivers are typically **chipset/motherboard-based**, not SSD-specific. The driver you need depends on your motherboard's chipset, not the SSD brand.     Here are my recommendation;    Identify Your Motherboard Chipset:  Check motherboard manual/box for chipset info (Z690, B550, X570, etc.)    Universal NVMe Driver Sources:  Windows 10/11 usually has built-in NVMe support  Try Windows installation without additional drivers first  If needed, use Microsoft's generic NVMe drivers you may contact Microsoft for additional guidance.    Motherboard Manufacturer Support:  Visit your motherboard brand's website (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, etc.)  Download chipset/storage drivers for your specific board model    Most likely solution, download Intel RST drivers or AMD chipset drivers based on your motherboard's chipset  this will provide the NVMe controller drivers needed for Windows installation.",Neutral

AMD,"Yes, I've turned off the system animations, and the blinking cursors.  There aren't settings to switch fonts, to replace thin/faint fonts with bold ones. The folks developing Windows like Segoe Ui, maybe they can read it. There are regedit hacks, but I'm not sure how to do them. There is also Winaero Tweaker, which can switch some fonts, but doesn't work on some older apps with unreadable text. There is MacType, which can bolden text without switching fonts, but doesn't work everywhere either.  There are settings to scale fonts, or scale everything, or reduce resolution. I've tried every combination of these. I've reduced resolution, since it does work everywhere. But I can't go below 1280x720, and I end up breaking some interfaces anyway. There is also the magnifier, but it gives me a migraine.  Here's the thing. If text is too thin/faint, making it 2x as bold will take less than 2x the screen space; making it 2x as big will take 4x the screen space.  I'm surprised how well tweaking gamma has worked. So far it has worked everywhere with dark text on light images, and it's worked very well.",Negative

Alrighty, since you're using the latest version now, how can I help? Are you running into any issues with the new application, or is there a specific feature that's not working as expected?",Neutral
AMD,"u/TheCupaCupa Great to hear it fixed itself! If it happens again, trying Turbo off sounds like a good plan.",Positive
AMD,"u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  You're encountering a common issue, Intel doesn't maintain a centralized QVL (Qualified Vendor List) specifically for X299 VROC at the platform level. Since X299 is a consumer chipset, the VROC compatibility lists were typically maintained by individual motherboard manufacturers rather than Intel directly. The C621 QVL you found is for Intel's server/workstation chipset, which has more formal validation processes. For X299 VROC compatibility, you'll need to check with your specific motherboard manufacturer (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, etc.) as they would have maintained their own compatibility lists during VROC's active period. However, since X299 VROC is now in sustaining mode, many manufacturers may no longer actively update these lists. Your best bet is to search for your specific motherboard model's support page or contact the manufacturer directly, though given the discontinued status, this information may be limited or archived.",Neutral

AMD,"That is what I'm following, I provided support everything on that list, including decoding the matrix on the front of the chip but they don't proceed with the ticket until they get a picture of the code on the pcb which is nigh on impossible.  I wound up taking it into the office to use a high resolution scanner thats used to digitise paintings and just about got something readable. I remain firm in my stance that whilst wanting to verify a serial number isn't outrageous, making the process in which you verify said information virtually impossible is.   I simply don't understand how regular people can take such a detailed photo using smartphone technology. My phone is 4 years old and was absolutely not capable (Samsung S20+)",Negative

AMD,"Just wanted to follow up for anyone seeing this or is in a similar boat. I can confirm that Intel DC P4510 drives will work in a VROC Raid using a standard key.      Not sure if intel support can confirm but it appears the ASROCK X299 Taichi CLX supports VROC Raid across multiple VMD Domains, which is supposed to be locked behind Xeon scalable CPU/Chipsets. I need to buy two more drives and try to add them to my array to confirm.",Neutral
