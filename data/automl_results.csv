Intel,"> At first I was told between the balanced mode on Microsoft Windows and balanced mode on Linux there can be up to a 15 Watt difference in the PL1 state. Then I was told the power limits were the same under Windows and Linux for this laptop, but that MSI programmed their balanced defaults lower than Intel recommends. Intel expects their OEMs to have higher PL1 minimum values for balanced mode but MSI set it lower at 15 Watts min and 30 Watts max for at least this laptop model.   Wait what, why did MSI set the power so low on the Prestige 14....   I really wanted the Prestige 16 Flip, hope that one has a higher power limit",Neutral

Intel,"The numbers I found interesting are the vkpeak tests, just like the [B580 ](https://www.phoronix.com/review/intel-arc-b580-gpu-compute/3)before it (though, OpenCL), Xe arch has a strong showing for precision compute.",Positive
Intel,"Seems like Xe drivers are still horrible, but Panther Lake brute forces its way to a win.",Negative
Intel,Has there been any articles commenting on battery life on Linux with Panther Lake? I know this article and the previous one was focused on perforamnce in the CPU and now iGPU but any word if battery life can be as ood as windows?,Neutral
Intel,"It is so odd to see the infatuation of the writer with Strix Halo wanting to compare it. It isn't comparable, it is a much larger chip, it is like comparing a Snapdragon Elite to a M4 Max. The writer keeps lamenting paragraph after paragraph about it.  They should compare comparable things. This fiat 500 isn't as fast as this Tesla type of thing is weird.",Negative
Intel,"I understand there's a lot of fanfare around Arc and Panther Lake in this sub. Many are firm believers that Intel will finally break the duopoly of AMD and Nvidia and while that may be the case, everyone seems to gloss over the driver side of things, not to mention the massive CPU overhead.   Just yesterday, I was recommended the latest video from YouTuber ""zWORMz"" benchmarking the 'ancient' RDR2 on a B580.  And even on Windows, the guy was frustrated with various driver issues and how the GPU wouldn't even run in his mid-range machine with an i5-12600K. Some issues even popped up right when he was recording.  With that in mind, I can only imagine the experience on Linux!",Neutral
Intel,Should be compared to Strix Halo based on price.   The power consumption does not look all that great:  > The Core Ultra X7 358H came out on a geo mean basis to 1.23x the performance of the Radeon 890M graphics with Strix Halo but at 1.25x the power consumption on average. The peak power consumption was also around 1.25x that of the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. So rather even on a performance-per-Watt basis overall.  Intel has a lot of work to do. 2 nodes advantage and still just matching Strix Point in power efficiency.,Negative

Intel,"There's nothing wrong comparing it to Strix Halo. Regardless of the data measured from Strix Halo the conclusion will inevitably be made on price/perf, perf/area etc. It's simply another interesting data point that is shared and pull comparisons from, which I am all for.

Intel,"Yeah, the Intel Vulkan drivers on Linux especially is still pretty bad, among the benchmarks linked in the post is FurMark which has both an OpenGL and Vulkan version, and Intel takes a noticeable hit in performance when using Vulkan while AMD sees basically no difference between OpenGL and Vulkan. The Vulkan driver being the weak part is a big problem since Vulkan is what's used for running games from DirectX 8 up to 12 by default, and for DX12 Vulkan is the only choice.  In my case I have a Framework 13 with the Intel Core Ultra 5 125H (Meteor Lake) and the Arc (Alchemist) 7-core iGPU, and I can't get a stable 60fps on Forza Horizon 5 no matter what I do, even disabling every graphical effect possible and dropping the resolution to 1024x768 doesn't work (if anything it's worse since the minimums stay the same so the difference between average and minimum just gets larger and the stutters feel way worse), while the LCD Steam Deck can manage 60fps flat perfectly fine at 1280x800 minimum settings at least, and it sips less power then too (under 15W vs 25W for the Framework), even though the CPU is just Zen2 which shouldn't be faster than the Meteor Lake P-cores, and since it's the LCD version the RAM is just LPDDR5-5500 so memory bandwidth shouldn't be too different from the DDR5-5600 in the Framework 13.",Negative

Intel,"I feel you. Assassin's Creed Syndicate runs at maximum \~30 FPS on Linux (normally lower) and almost double under Windows on my Intel Lunar Lake. Even on CachyOS and Nobara, and using some additional flags, the performance is not as good as on Windows.  My workaround was to create a Windows 2 Go installation on an external disk and use it to play games, which is a pity because I really wanted to get rid of Microsoft.  As for the Steam Deck, do you feel that you can play all your titles reasonably well? I was holding off on buying it because hardware-wise it seems to be weaker.

Intel,"Vulkan API has a fix for the DX12 translation layer, its in the Nvidia Drivers now just it has to be added to DXVK, Wine, Proton etc.",Neutral
Intel,"Unfortunately I don't have the Deck anymore since I realized I'm not really in the target demographic, I was mostly interested because it looked like it could be a little PC that runs Linux natively, but the thickness of the controller part means it takes up more space than a laptop when put in a backpack, and I don't game on the go much anyway, hence the Framework lol.  As for ""can it play all my titles reasonably well"", I don't remember any specific titles that didn't run at all, so I guess the answer is yes? I do remember having tested Oblivion Remastered and Dragon Age Veilguard, both are Steam Deck Verified, and they do indeed run, but it's very much a 30fps experience reliant on FSR to achieve even that, so I'd guess it probably won't handle newer or heavier titles any better. If you have any specific titles you care about I'd suggest checking ProtonDB and filter the reports to just Steam Deck ones to get a picture of how the game might run, and sometimes games are marked unsupported by Valve but does actually run with caveats like input quirks so you'd be able to play if you're fine with those quirks.",Negative
Intel,"18A is basically N3B, so no",Neutral
Intel,"Thanks for sharing your experience. I'm not a big gamer myself, that's why I ended up buying the Lunar Lake laptop (battery life is more important than gaming), but yeah, I should have read a bit more on the Intel situation regarding gaming on Linux.

Intel,">The fact that Intel will use nVidia technology in the iGPU sector in the long term  You're takin the nv intel deal outta context. Intel is still gonna use their own igpu ip for the average mobile socs and their dgpus. It's the premium dgx or halo type prosumer skus that are going with nv ip. There might be some gaming capable devices but just like strix halo they ain't primarily aimed at gamers. The price just ain't worth it compared to a standard mobile cpu + nvidia dgpu combo  Idk why this post is even a thing. All manufacturers are delaying dgpu products for gamers because they have shit margins compared to dc gpus. Nvidia's dc margins in the 70+%, why would they care about gamers? Gaming gpus have worse margins than diy cpus which have worse margins than dc gpus. It's the same for amd  Do ya know **how much money gamers are making for nvidia each quarter? $4.5-5b. How much do ai gpus make for nvidia? Over $50b.** How much for amd? Estimated at $4b+ for 2026. **Amd's making the equivalent of capturing 100% of the gaming gpu market from ai gpus and with even higher margins.** Why would they want to sell to gamers?  Fact that people just gotta face even if they hate it: The gamer money is nothing compared to the ai money. People are mad, but no amount of yelling at the sky and hoping for the ""bubble to pop"" will change that.",Neutral
Intel,">The fact that Intel will use nVidia technology in the iGPU sector in the long term and that the development of HPC/AI accelerators no longer has much to do with consumer graphics cards from a technical standpoint also plays a role here.

Intel,"If Intel seizes the opportunity and makes the follow on to Panther Lake and Nova Lake with twice the number of Xe tiles, then this may meet the needs of 80% of the gamers, and Nvidia and AMD may find themselves with no commercial market for discrete GPU cards.  The high end Pather Lake has 12 Xe cores, and it brings 1080p gaming to all day laptops. I wonder what 24 Xe would do, and of course the same approach applies to doubling whatever Nova Lake comes out with.

Intel,"I wouldn't call these “two types,” because that implies a closeness that simply doesn't exist technologically. HPC/AI and consumer/gaming are completely separate fields of development with completely separate chips. I mean different chips at the chip level, not just versions of chips.

So you sell the RAM for cost, meaning you charge $350 for the SoC.  Yes, you've made the same nominal profit of $150, but your margin % dropped from 50% to ~43% *and* this simple math example doesn't take into account that there is a cost involved with having to source the memory yourself (i.e pay staff to manage contracts, make and track orders, receive shipments, package the RAM, etc.)  That's why it's very difficult for on-package memory to gain traction in the Windows PC world: Most CPU makers don't want to take the margin hit, and most OEMs would prefer to just handle memory quantity and product tiering themselves.",Neutral

Intel,Every gaming dev should target the B390 as the 1080p 60fps on medium/low tbh,Neutral
Intel,It seems odd that the Arc B390 was listed as the minimum required IGPU when the much weaker discrete Arc A380 is also on there. I'm sure most of the last generation IGPUs like the Radeon 880M or 890M are also powerful enough (considering they are faster than the Arc A380).  We've always known that the Forza Horizon games are very well optimized and are able to run on IGPUs just fine. Keep in mind that Forza Horizon 5 runs just fine on the Vega 3 IGPU in the 7 year old AMD Athlon 3000G.  The article is presenting the trivial fact that the B390 is listed as the minimum spec for the upcoming Forza Horizon 6 as somehow being a huge win for Intel. That's not very good journalism. It was going to run on IGPUs regardless of whether or not the B390 existed.,Neutral

Intel,"except you, unreal engine",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, it feels a bit like marketing and there have been a few of those.  Right now pretty much any computer with the X9 or X7 is expensive. You can find 5050 laptops for the same price. This chipset isn’t going to do that well unless it can be found at a decent price.   Also buyers should be careful because not every laptop presented has the power and thermals set to permit full power sustained boosting at the wattages tested in the reviews.   Those laptops should get cheaper and so on of course. Right now we don’t know. A Dell XPS costs more than a new mid-range MacBook Pro though, that is steep.",Negative

Older laptops are still floating around and being priced of DDR prices from 6 months ago.  If that 5050 laptop launched today, it would have to deal with $100+ dollars in extra manufacturing cost.  Also the initial launch models for new Intel CPUs always come at a premium. Budget models will come and also prices will be slashed from launch prices. Something that has already happened with older generations.",Neutral

Intel,"Okay, so same thing. No, that is not Microsoft's baseline.",Neutral
Intel,"Why not? Microsoft announced it like it's an official console, shouldn't their first party studios support it then?",Neutral
Intel,"Probably two main reasons off the top of my head: the Xbox Ally released quite late in this console cycle and it's very weak. There already exists a large library of games that would not be playable and Microsoft suddenly (drastically) lowering the minimum target would be messy for devs. Even the Series S can barely do raytracing effects, for example. [Microsoft maintains a compatibility list](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/handhelds/handheld-compatibility) much like Valve with the Steam Deck.  Maybe things change with the next gen if Microsoft brings out a first party handheld, but for now it's just a bonus if runs on the Ally.",Negative
Intel,"What purpose is going to be achieved by supporting superficial gimmicks like ray tracing? Four generations of NVidia, three generations of AMD in, it's still incredibly difficult to find a game where the ray tracing is visible without a side-by-side screenshot comparison AND where it doesn't make the game look worse. And forcing that setting to ""on"" with certain presets doesn't exactly fix that in any way. Sure, I can continue to waste power and processing cycles on it, but it doesn't change how I still have yet to find enough games to tick BOTH of those boxes to run out of fingers on the two hands. Even after padding out the list with Quake 2 and crap Minecraft variant.",Negative

Intel,"die area is not the only cost indicator. B580 actually uses N5 fab, which is likely cheaper than N4, used by 5050. In reality, B580 only has about ~15% more transistors and if we assume N5 is cheaper per transistor and N5 has higher yields (by being more mature) i'd say their die cost might be very similar.  While yes, it has wider memory, the chips are clocked lower, so they can buy slower bins, reducing per chip cost.   B580 has more power draw, which in turn costs more for power delivery and cooling.  All in all, AIB manufacturer likely has lower margin per card as it stands, so i wouldn't be surprised if intel is taking a lower margin on the gpu/gddr combo to get more market share.  Nvidia on the other hand optimized their cost REALLY well, as they have been doing GPUs for almost 30 years.",Neutral
Intel,"Nvidia is getting such good performance out of such a small die because they're the best. Simple as. They've been doing GPU's for decades. It's not unexpected that at this stage Intel needs to use a larger die to match the performance - it would be incredibly surprising if that wasn't the case.  But a small *part* of that die size advantage comes from that narrow 128bit bus, and *part* of B580's appeal is its wider bus and subsequently more VRAM.",Positive

They stoke hardware enthusiast anger for their own gain. Personally i think the harm they do to the space/peoples mentality is farm more than the amount of good most (key word most, fire risks and stuff deserve prompt drama) of their coverage does.   Even this title takes a topic and very educational opportunity to provide actual hardware coverage and immediatly try’s to stoke negative furry about some aspect of the hardware industry. Its just non stop with them. I dont think its healthy for anyone to watch then honestly, which is sad as i used to enjoy their review/news. I hope for their sake they are not actually so perpetually angry and they are doing what they do to knowingly manipulate their audience for increased views/engagement. I cant imagine living life so constantly angry at every possible point over computer hardware, as much as i am saddened by the current state hardware and love gaming.   As tough as it is with rising prices and such and sad to think of what we could have instead, modern hardware, gaming, and such is in a nearly historic good state (realistic cost to perf is probably lowest in history other than brief periods such as the 30 series launch), and is a very cost effective hobby compared with other ones for the time you get out of it. Many great games launch all the time (even if big name traditional games have largely went to trash). They are easier to run with hardware (like the ARC gpu) being quite cheap and capable. People, like GN, need to temper their overexagerated frustration with a dose of real world perspective and objectivity.",Negative

Intel,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310. Almost anything these days is better than an A310.  >  Like the GT710 make no sense nowadays (their last attempt was what, the GeForce GTX 1630?), even though they sold like hotcakes for offices and for people who just wanted HDMI outs.  GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered. GTX 1630 was okay but it was supposed to be $149 USD MSRP and it came out for like $200 USD in most stores due to GPU shortage at the time, not much NVIDIA could really do about that.",Neutral

Intel,"Compared to my 890M based laptop, the 890M numbers here are about 15-20% lower than what I'm seeing at the same settings.  This is likely due to power targets?  Even if the uplift is just 60% instead of 80%, that's still an impressive achievement for the B390M.  It's a shame that AMD appears to have dropped the iGPU ball in 2026.  Relying on the Strix Halo is not an option here.  It's pretty much impossible to find a good laptops that use it.  The upcoming HX470, and still without FSR4, isn't going to close the apparent large gap.  It seems that AMD forgot to stay hungry and they'll end up losing whatever ground that they'd gained in the last few years.

Intel,"I think the B390 could be faster than even an RTX 5050 35W (As it could beat an RTX 4050 at 60W).       These thin and light laptops that Panther Lake is built for use way underpowered GPUs. Honestly, it makes sense why the Dell XPS 14 only has the B390 graphics. Before it used an RTX 4050, but it ran at just 30W of power.

Intel is really dependent on CCG, it is double in revenue to DCAI. They invest in what makes them money. Compared to AMD, client and DCAI is doing well, for client CPUs and GPUs are doing well, putting no pressure in mobile, in fact their strategy has remained the same in the past couple the years and even if marginally their % share is sufficient for them.

The only aspect Intel kind of messed up that annoys me is their video encoder, once it gets pegged to 100%, it absolutely tanks your performance on the capture to the point where it skips frames and lags. It never used to do that and the driver also used to include capture software, now they just offload it to people having to download OBS and removed the capture aspect of the driver.

Intel,"They announced a first party Strix Halo PC at CES, but it'll probably be really expensive.",Neutral
Intel,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips.

This directly threatens Nvidia's consumer laptop volume in the entry segment. Intel is claiming close to 4050 performance at this lower TDP, and that's certainly good enough for many to not have the tradeoffs of having a dGPU in their laptop.  If the new market is moving towards putting GPUs on the CPU package instead of discretely on the board, Nvidia doesn't want to place all of their hopes on WoA becoming better, and are hedging by doing both their own SoC *and* an x86 APU with Intel.

Intel,"We will see, while Intel's PR and marketing is extremely confusing, Intel did confirm Xe3P will come to desktop; and at least from driver updates (as a very happy B580 owner) driver support has been constant and lively.  I had some issues with an older Civ game, I reported an issue in [their app](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000057021/graphics/other-graphics.html) with screenshots/etc, and while I never got any notification, the game works perfectly now a few months later. Dunno if they read those reports, but my card keeps getting better.  I actually think a MSRP B580 is another card that will age like fined wine -- YMMV depends on games you play, but in Australia they have been regularly sold slightly below international MSRP and represent phenomenal value in the price class.",Positive
Intel,That's bloody good for an iGPU. It's been nice to see them finally get to respectable performance over the last few years. Intel in particular has really upped their iGPU game & it shows.,Positive
Intel,not to mention it is a little skewed as they threw in a title which pushed the vram limit on the 4050 making the b390 over 800 percent faster in that title which obviously messes with the average.,Neutral
Intel,It's 10% faster geomean across 45 games,Neutral
Intel,That can be resolved if either Intel or AMD decides to unlock quad-channel on consumer chips and mobos. It's artificial market segmentation; the die area needed to deliver more (LP)DDR5 channels is absolutely minuscule; for a huge boost in iGPU performance.,Neutral
Intel,Cache. Lots of it.,Neutral
Intel,"They are using 9600mt/s lpddr5x, could also have a lot of cache, (iirc 890m configs were nerfed in cache because they wanted to put a npu instead), and also could be a synthetic benchmark or specific game that isn't very bandwidth heavy.",Neutral
Intel,Panther Lake still has a 128 bit memory bus so only models with 9600 mt/s will get slightly faster shared memory bandwidth than Lunar Lake.   I wonder how this will manifest in games as the only performance leaks have been from Geekbench and 3DMark which may not be as bandwidth intensive as real games and applications.,Neutral
Intel,"This seems to be correct, since checking NotebookCheck for the 30 watt 4050 shows that it’s around 70% faster than the HX370 in games, which is roughly where Intel places their iGPU.  The performance difference between a 30 watt 4050 and full 140 watt 4050 is around 41 percent performance based on Time Spy",Positive
Intel,"basically cheating tho, rtx cards in dell laptops are barely getting enough watts to even turbo",Negative
Intel,"That's the only way to do a fair comparison, really.   Because the 45 watts that Intel chip uses is shared for the entire chip.   So it's still 45w Intel + igpu vs 60w Intel+gpu",Neutral
Intel,"It’s a super strong generational gain though, it’s like the jump from Vega 8CU to rdna2 12CU. The kind of single gen gain you see once in 5 years at most",Positive
Intel,The thing about that... what sort of tile are we expecting them to package up? As you say if we can get 4050ish performance from an Intel iGPU then they really can't be far off 5050M... and maybe even 5060M performance in future.  Do you think they'll offer something like a 5070 tile? that almost seems excessive (and difficult to actually package from a thermal point of view in a laptop) but it seems like the 5050/5060 sort of tier is going to be pretty well covered as a traditional iGPU soon.,Neutral
Intel,AMD actually introduced lower tier Strix Halos in this CES; and the first budget laptop thats gonna use it is [the Asus TUF A14](https://youtu.be/h27w0PXFBgk?si=Pa7UQhinywF-uFMj&t=306),Neutral
Intel,They're a lot more accurate than whatever the fuck Nvidia has been doing where you have to decode their bar graphs for proper scaling lmao,Negative
Intel,"I'm pretty sure Intel threw lots of ""marketing money"" for the MSI Claw too. There were heaps of MSI Claw promotional booths / draws at shopping malls / public places in Australia and it was heavily discounted.  I picked one up for about $550 AUD (after rebates; tax included), which is like $369 USD inclusive of tax.",Neutral
Intel,> Lunar Lake was a expensive product which didn't make sense in handhelds   What do you mean? All the tradeoffs LNL made were pretty good fits for a handheld.,Negative
Intel,"I don't think that will really be an issue, laptops can be configured with soldered 8 channel RAM like AMDs Z2 extreme, or they can still manage easily with regular DDR5 6400Mhz sodimms, which run at 102.4GB/s  Plus the CPUs that have intels new B390 iGPU are 4P/8E CPUs, so I doubt there will be much issues from low ram speeds. Something like the Radeon 890M have done fine with such speeds",Neutral
Intel,"> I've been eyeing Dells and Lenovos, and basically all SKUs that previously had 6000 are getting substituted with 4800   You're looking at normal DDR, not LPDDR. LPDDR5-9600 *is* a JEDEC spec, and already available in mobile.",Neutral
Intel,"The majority of the lineup still only has 4. Will be interesting to see what the pricing and performance is on those since these will likely be quite limited. What's also a bit crazy is there's three different nodes being used for the various GPUs, and the full 12 unit one is probably on N3.",Neutral
Intel,cpu: compute processing unit,Neutral
Intel,"I doubt it's exactly 73% outside of cherrypicked games, but it should not be shocking that it's significantly faster than rehashed rdna3.",Neutral
Intel,"Every Intel marketing benchmark for like a decade or so, but especially their GPUs seem to do far better in their benchmarks than they do in reality.",Positive
Intel,"Ice lake, Alder lake, Metor Lake",Neutral
Intel,"Different poster than OP.  Compute tile on Lunar Lake is 140mm2 on N3E with a small 46mm2 controller N6 tile. Strix Point (HX 370) as a whole is 233 mm2 on N4P. Lunar Lake is clearly cheaper, but given the newer node and packaging not massively so, likely by around 20-25%.  Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins. For all purposes it's an accounting trick to hide CCG's and DCAI's 5-15% operating margins if you divide the foundry losses per group revenue.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, although the actual low power 8 core successor to Lunar Lake is the 335/365 with half GPU cores and slower RAM.",Neutral
Intel,"even if you exclude the CPU CCDs the graphics die alone is bigger than a RTX 5070Ti mobile GPU, which also retails for \~$2000-$3000, same as Strix Halo laptop",Neutral
Intel,"This is slightly splitting hairs but the 8c CCDs in Strix Halo is actually NOT the same chiplet as the ones in desktop zen 5 parts. It iirc is produced on a smaller node, slimmed down, and has different ( or no) TSVs.  It is similar to design and cache sizes to desktop however, but the changes to the CCDs were done to improve low power performance characteristics. They are likely a bit more expensive than Desktop CCDs.  I believe it is discussed in a chips&cheese deep dive.",Neutral
Intel,"AMD have largely been ""winning by doing nothing"" due to their better driver support stack for gaming on iGPUs, rather than actually throwing superior hardware at it.  It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.  Given how effective DLSS is on the Switch2, one could only imagine how kickass a Nvidia chip in a handheld PC could be with the far more ubiquitous DLSS support.",Neutral
Intel,Now they are not. The panther lake igpus are undisputed winners (excluding the 395+ from amd since it's just not gonna be mainstream). You can get a 358H or 368H and you'll have solid laptop for igpu gaming far cheaper than the 395+,Positive
Intel,"For business apps laptops have been good enough for 10 years now, iGPU and battery life is really the only differentiator.",Positive
Intel,"Intel is plenty competent for gaming, and has XeSS which is way better than FSR3.",Positive
Intel,Lol? No 6 or 8 core 3dvcache laptops and no 5080 or 5090 laptops. Strix Halo is a joke for gaming as well,Negative
Intel,The 9955HX + 5070Ti is $2240 and the 275HX + 5080 is $2540.   When both 5070Ti configurations are on sale they should be the same price.,Neutral
Intel,My mistake I was thinking of Strix Halo,Neutral
Intel,"It's about compromise. I don't *want* a 4lb laptop. I don't want a laptop that runs hot when web browsing. Or a laptop that has loud fans, or gets poor battery.  I have a desktop for gaming and other demanding tasks. For a laptop, I, and most of the market, want it focused on portability. Light weight. Cool running. Long battery. These big iGPU PTL laptops are really interesting because they provide *good enough* gaming without sacrifice to the non-gaming livability of the device.",Neutral
Intel,"It took me way too long to convince my sister the AMD laptop I bought her isn’t going to blow up in her face and lose all her data, the Intel(and now Apple) CPU brands are very strong.",Neutral

Intel,"its always ""fix it next generation"" with AMD.",Negative
Intel,This is unfortunate news  (╥﹏╥),Neutral
Intel,"I mean yeah it's not ideal, but you could argue it's the same with XeSS or FSR 4 on RDNA 3. Since the OP said ""there's no decent upscaling on AMD handheld"", therefore I assume Opsticaler is out of the question too.",Neutral
Intel,"Well you said it, it's TSMC capacity, meaning also a priority issue. They prioritize AI over consumers and then increase the price by reducing availability, meaning the same chip costs more, meaning more margin.  Seeing they increase the 5090 to roughly 5k (USD) is just the beginning and as I know all companies will use the increasing memory prices to say they must increase the product price, just not proportional to the memory costs.  next step: then they will use this to move more to streaming instead of owning",Neutral
Intel,"> Power levels are determined by the frequency of a given CPU core   There are SoC and platform level targets that depend on a lot more than just clock speed for the same cores. Consider how LNL's PMICs scale vs FIVR/DLVR. Or what operating point benefits the most from the on package memory.   Especially at really low power, the cores are not your big concern. Consider the difference at 10W between 50% of your budget available for compute and 80%.   > so given the added IPC of the new Panther lake e-cores   We're talking a couple percent. DKT is a tick.    > and better process node   Very much unproven.    If you want to give credit somewhere, pretty much all of it should go to the SoC and GPU teams.",Neutral
Intel,"Xe2, Xe3, etc. are the ""real"", more accurate names. Battlemage, Celestial are the marketing names.  Intel's decision to label the new Xe3 iGPUs as ""Battlemage"" is certainly an interesting (odd) choice - my best guess for this decision is that next year, Xe3P discrete will launch alongside Xe3P iGPU in NVL, and they're saving the new Celestial naming for that launch event.  Xe2 -> Xe3 is the bigger change.",Positive

Intel,"Not really sure. I believe it's Hammer Lake that's debuting the Nvidia tile, and that's rumored for a 2029 launch, so still quite a ways off, and 2 generations ahead of Blackwell.  The only rumors I'm aware of that it's going to be a pretty big iGPU",Neutral

Intel,Wattage limited 4050 to 30 watts is the only slide that’s suspect.  It’s around a 41 percent performance loss based on Time Spy from the 140 watt 4050.,Neutral
Intel,I think they meant that the chip is very pricey which sucks because the handheld is already low-margin otherwisr and can't be priced too high else it got undercut by its competitors.,Negative
Intel,The standard 4Xe models use the extra die space they save to have more PCIe lanes. that large iGPU adds cost and doesn't make much sense to use that chip if you're gonna add an Nvidia dGPU,Negative

A couple titles amd does well in were thrown in there too though like God of war and Cod but im guessing the real performance difference is more like 40-60 rather than the claimed 70-80.

A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.  Sorry for the rambling.",Neutral
Intel,"That's a marketplace listing, it's basically eBay, because Newegg is out of 5090FEs directly.  You can get it on the overpriced StockX for far cheaper: https://stockx.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-32gb-graphics-card-900-1g144-2530-000",Neutral
Intel,"That would make some sense if they *did* plan a Celestial launch, but that's a big ""if"" and is just creating confusion for now. And it'll be even worse when NVL mixes Xe3 and Xe3p.    You also have Intel marketing actively making the situation worse like that Peterson interview people keep quoting to justify this nonsense.

Intel,"Yeah, the first 6 core i/u5 series since 11th gen. :/",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah idk why but they typically got OLEDs exclusively, though could be a US market thing. I would also note I was mostly looking at decently built midrange to high-end laptops. I think AMD is more common in the plastic crap box design and may be a better value there, but those also typically seem to have a ton of older rebadged processors instead of the newer Kraken Point unless something changed.",Neutral
Intel,"I enjoy reading your optimism. I hope it all comes true, but it sounds a bit too good to be true given the recent hardware developements. The 5090 scaling issue is that we stopped resolution scaling. If you go beyond 4k the 5090 scales a lot. VR resolutions report the 5090 being as much as twice the framerates of 4090.",Positive
Intel,I've rewritten prev reply to provide more info.  I'll also link the scheduling patent here in case anyone reading this thread is interested: [https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2)   It sounds like gains in workgraphs scenarios will be be even greater.,Positive
Intel,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW? But yeah high end perf scaling falls apart at sub 4K internal res.",Negative
Intel,"I dont think much can be done with overhead. AMDs overhead is already small, basically letting the API go directly to GPU as it is. While for Nvidia side, isnt most of the overhead related to how Nvidia handles DX12? in that case i dont see it going away for a long time.",Negative
Intel,"Interesting, GN usually gets Tom to do discussions like these but instead decided to publish whatever that previous video was on 'Intel pulling an Nvidia'. I bet GN will probably have their own video with Tom, but I appreciate DF a little bit more with this discussion.  At around 21min, it's interesting to hear his talk on cross-vender SR, mentions how they'd like to work more on Nvidia's Streamline and a candid talk about DirectSR and how it isn't really the concrete solution for the work on cross vendor SR. At around 23min, Alex brought up something interesting about research they've published before on joint denoiser and SR. He kinda skirts around it, but continues on suggesting they have more plans on it. He also then continues on the state of PT, DXR 1.2, obviously it isn't a real focus with something on their iGPUs, but any future HW, will be their primary goal to tackle. Alex mentions Valve/Linux, and Tom says it isn't entirely their focus right now, at least for gaming.",Positive

Intel,"Intel already talked about this a couple months ago. It's not an announcement here, but it seems people are more interested in AMD and Nvidia news so those threads don't get as much traction.",Neutral
Intel,I feel like more people paying more attention since the market’s grown a lot.   I remember old games I played in the early 2000s having micro and regular stuttering depending on the game. I chalked it up to “huh guess it’s loading in data as I play” when I didn’t know much.,Neutral
Intel,We are paying more attention to it but I suspect as we push higher frames with new engines and techniques the micro stutter is getting worse. It just starts becoming less perceptible to people than say the micro stutter from SLI and other stuff that caused issues in the past.,Negative
Intel,"I think digital foundry answered that question on their podcast. Compared to 15 years ago the frame rate is higher on average for most gamers, but it also stutters more. So it's huge fps with huge drops and hangs.",Neutral
Intel,"Worth remembering no one even gave a shit about stuttering enough to measure it until someone at I think it was anandtech back in the late 00s was so fed up with shitty perf on his crossfire system he started doing 1% lows on benchmarks.   Back in the 90s people would run like 6x SLI voodoos and not even care that the game hitched every 10 seconds down to sub 30s fps lol...  Edit: it's also key to remember that a lot of the games that stutter on PC these days stutter in the exact same places for the exact same reasons, and worse considering the lack of CPU power, on consoles. Console gamers just don't give a fuck lol....   DF did a good video showing this truth with the Silent Hill 2 remake.",Negative

Intel,If the end visuals are better who cares. we already did a lot of such things in engine just didnt tell the players about it. One in four frames actually rendering shadows is a thing for example. Heck some games go as bad as once a second shadow updates.,Negative
Intel,"Well, I think that most people (myself included) don't really care how it's done if the end result is looking good and feel good to play, off course something like 30fps based with MFG to 120 is bs, but I quite regularly use 60 -> 120 using frame gen because It feels okay input wise to me at 60, and the added visual smoothness is quite nice. So it all depends how it's implemented and talked about.",Neutral

Intel,"> The Shader delivery program was launched on an AMD handheld  i assume you're referring to the steamdeck, which to my understanding was done by valve... so the point kinda stands, you just add valve to the preamble.",Neutral
Intel,"I dunno I remember many games, especially based on Quake engine, being buttery smooth if you could get to reasonable FPS",Neutral
Intel,also more cause for stutering. Back then we could compile shaders real time with no siginficant issues because they were small. Now we have to compile shaders real time that are huge to the point where we pre-compile half of them before we even start the game.,Neutral
Intel,Console gamers *of certain genres* care.   The FGC rejected the idea of playing Street Fighter IV & MvC3  on PS3 because the Xbox 360 port had better input latency.   Even the PS4 port of USFIV wasn't liked.     Part of why I stopped going to tournaments is because SFV & Tekken 7 on PS4 always felt *off* compared to PC.,Negative
Intel,"Not really. In many cases, console versions of games just don't stutter whereas PC games do because modern games are mainly designed for consoles and then ported to PC.  A couple of good recent examples are Wukong and Outer Words 2. Neither of those games on consoles have the horrid stutters that are prevalent on PC.",Neutral

Plenty of content he could have farmed off that, especially BEFORE the RAM shortage where having an 8GB card was some sort of sin in his eyes (except for some reason he ignored it but raile roaded the cheaper RTX 5050, lol did someone say bias?). Instead, he just tore the 9060 XT 8GB down and never touched it again after that teardown. I'm sorry but there's GENUINELY stuff he could be doing instead of farming clicks about 'NVIDIA bad' and 'Intel pathetic', but that won't get him views from drama farming NVIDIA which is what he craves these days. So sad to see a big channel like his who got big off doing solid technical content become a drama-hype ""news"" channel.",Negative

Intel,"Geekbench’s scaling has always been problematic, and the differences between architectures are huge. The benchmark is very friendly to ARM and least favorable to AMD. Even a random Apple M5 chip can easily score close to 20,000.  Therefore, cross-architecture comparisons using Geekbench scores have little real meaning. The only valid reference is **same-generation, same-architecture comparisons**, such as between the 285H and 388H.

Intel,"It’s obvious that this is the viewpoint of an outsider. Professionals would never look at it this way. Professionals first evaluate a processor based on its specifications, features, and process technology. Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake are *not* using some outdated process — they use TSMC’s then-most-advanced N3B node, Intel’s first time adopting it. Meanwhile, Panther Lake uses Intel’s own **18A** process.  Based on the current benchmark results, Intel’s 18A appears to outperform TSMC’s N3B by at least the same margin that **Intel 4** trailed behind N3B — which is an astonishing result.  Every day you hear people saying how much TSMC has advanced, how far ahead its processes are, how “outdated” Intel’s nodes are, how AMD’s processors using TSMC have excellent efficiency. These kinds of statements have been repeated endlessly over the past decade.  Yet today, Intel is using its newest process node to **clearly surpass** TSMC’s top process from just one year ago.",Neutral
Intel,"the real test will be how many watts the X9 388H needs to achieve its scores, because the 285HX needed like 90 watts to achieve its scores  so if the X9 could hit its scores while on its base TDP (65 watts) then thats a \~40% increase in efficiency, not bad",Neutral

Intel,"I have carefully compared the various models across Geekbench, PassMark, and the differences between Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake. If my judgment is correct, the theoretical peak performance of the 484 in Cinebench R23 should reach around **24,500**; the 285H scores **22,500**. Compared with the 285H, it should be easier for the 484 to achieve high scores because its power requirements are significantly lower than the previous generation built on TSMC N3B.  Its peak performance will not be extremely strong because the frequency is not high. IPC is likely improved by around **10–11%**, but clock speeds drop by about **6%**. Overall, that means single-core performance should only rise by **4–5%**.  The improvement will be most noticeable in Geekbench. Since PassMark single-core also shows gains, the IPC uplift and resulting single-core increase should be quite certain. If Geekbench were the only source, it would still be questionable, but PassMark is more solid and has higher reference value.  Overall, in terms of peak performance, the uplift is average—around **10%**, close to that figure.  However, the real key is the **efficiency gains**. I believe they will be excellent. Compared with the 285H, which requires **65 W** to reach **20,000** points in Cinebench R23, I estimate that the **388H** may only need **40–45 W**.  I also estimate that the Cinebench R24 score should fall around **1300–1400**. Compared with Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 at **1950**, there is still a significant gap—but the two products differ drastically in scale.  Overall, Panther Lake’s greatest achievements lie in several aspects:  1. **Energy efficiency** — likely the best among all x86 products. 2. **Performance per mm²** — excellent. For example, the 484: if you look at its die shot, the total area of the CPU (including the CPU tile’s 4P and 4 LPE cores and all caches) is essentially equal to the die area of a traditional monolithic 8-core design. That means the 484 uses the same silicon resources as past 8-core chips, yet **no AMD mobile 8-core processor surpasses it**, either in raw performance or efficiency. 3. It also offers better performance-per-area than Qualcomm’s processors. The X Elite 2 has **18 cores**, including **12 “very large” cores**—similar in size to Intel P-cores—and **6 large cores**, each larger than Intel’s E-cores. The die area of this chip is **2.5× larger** than Panther Lake 484’s.",Neutral

Intel,"I had the exact same issue as you and it frustrated me for the longest time. I upgraded to a 5070 from a 2070 super, CPU was Ryzen 5800x. Tried to play Arc raiders and I had the same frames if not worse on 1080p with a 5070 compared to my 2070 super.  Ended up spending the extra money and upgrading to AM5 and it was absolutely worth it. Went from 100 - 120fps fps on 1080/1440p (was the exact same for me) to about 220-240fps on 1440p. Found a cheap bundle deal on Facebook marketplace for a 7800x3d and 32GB of DDR5 CL30 6000 RAM for about £400 (Found this last month so yeah after DDR5 price increase). Bought a B650 Eagle for 120 off Amazon, so worked up to £520 total  Sold my old parts for 200 (CPU, Mobo and DDR4 RAM), so all in all spent about £320, which was worth it for me.  Think about it like this, RAM prices may not get better for a while, yeah you could go and try to get a 5800x3d (good luck they dont produce those no more) but for a little extra money you could get waaaaay more performance upgrading to AM5. Keep looking around Facebook for some good deals, took me a while to find one but you will find something eventually.  Sounds like to me Arc Raiders is your main game, in which case I would highly recommend upgrading. If not you could stay on your current platform, and a 1440p monitor would be the sensible upgrade. OLEDs are expensive and yeah theyre cool (I have the MO27Q28G) but most are above 240hz refresh rate, which ideally you would like to hit to make the most of the money youre gonna spend on one.  FYI - I tried all the overclocking and Precision boost overdrive BS and everything else in between there was to try and squeeze more performance out of the CPU to limit the bottleneck, nothing worked.  Edit: I also used the 2x frame gen to get more GPU utilization, gives a nice FPS boost and the latency increase was not that bad, but it still bothered me enough to want to upgrade.",Neutral
Intel,"Don’t upgrade to am5, even then at 1080p you wouldn’t get full use off your GPU in some games. It’ll be a lot better to get a 1440p monitor and that will eliminate your bottleneck.

Intel,"I think you should just get a Ryzen 7 5700X or 5800X, whichever is cheaper, and your performance will be much better. (if you can get your hands on a 5700X3D you'll see no bottleneck anymore)  How much RAM do you currently have?  If you have the budget and want to get to AM5, you can go for parts like:  MSI B850 Tomahawk  Ryzen 5 7500x3d (if the budget permits 7800x3d)  32 gigabytes of RAM  Unfortunately, you are looking at either spending around $200-300 to just get a CPU upgrade on AM4 or spending $700-$800 to hop on the new platform...  I'd suggest getting a CPU upgrade only. What do you think?

Intel,It's definitely the monitor. I had that same setup on my 1440p monitor back then and I was only bottlenecked in eSports games.   Triple A games were fine tho 1% lows did suffer. Try using VSR and run the game at 1440p to get a feel on how the game performs.,Neutral
Intel,"I see, would be worth testing. You could even buy a monitor on amazon, test it, then return it withing the return window for a full refund.

Intel,"Oh wow, I mean I don't know if I'm getting the max fps possible, probably not, but I thought that bottleneck would lead to a lower utilisation of the GPU?

Intel,"Oh, yeah go immediately turn that on in the settings, it'll drastically lower your input latency and will probably make the game feel a lot nicer for you.  High refresh rates mainly feel nice because of the lower input lag, and the visual smoothness/clarity in motion? 90fps is definitely a lot better than 60, and with antilag 2 your latency should be FAR better than what you're currently getting.  Give it a go and let me know though, maybe you'll still want to upgrade. But if you do like it, I'd recommend looking into optiscaler because it can inject antilag 2 into games that don't normally have it (if they're single player or non-anticheat games).",Positive
Intel,"https://de.pcpartpicker.com/list/zjLQpK  That's what I would do. I looked at the prices for 2x8 kits and they are quite bad, you can also go 1x16 (and add another stick later) but you will lose a lot of performance from not using 2 sticks.  You can go a bit cheaper with the CPU if needed, 7600(X) or 9600(X), the 7600X3D is just a good step up for quite a few games.  You can go also look at a slightly more expensive motherboard, only downside to that one is that it only supports PCIe gen4, while others can do gen5. For your GPU it doesn't make any difference, but for a future GPU it could make a (small) performance difference.",Negative
Intel,7600x3d would do it too. Anything would be a big upgrade vs your current CPU.,Neutral
Intel,Also its still 300€,Neutral
Intel,I was thinking if maybe ram speeds are the problem because 5600 is very sensitive to that. I would honestly wait until this ram mess is over. Paying that overpriced prices for ram is crazy. What settings do you use in Arc Raiders?,Negative
Intel,"1599.7 is correct because that's 3200 MT/s so your ram is running where it should. This leaves us with cpu bound because of the fact that high drops fps 15% while low/medium barely changes anything. At low settings the gpu finishes frames instantly and waits on the cpu. at high the gpu finally has enough work to become the limiter. so yeah I think your cpu is genuinely the bottleneck, 1440p monitor alone won't save you.  Just grab a 5800x and a decent 3600 cl16 kit, won't cost you more than a monitor upgrade and actually addresses the problem. am5 can wait until ddr5 stops being robbery.",Neutral
Intel,Depends on price I suppose. Should run the GPU better. Probably better off getting an X3D chip and calling it good,Positive
Intel,"Dude your post brought back the trauma of spending hours tweaking curve optimizer, 3dmark and cinebench, all in the name of reducing the bottleneck. Nothing works like a upgrade, you could get the last 7 series chip (5900x) and you will still have the same issue.  Yeah go for it. I'd suggest getting 32gb of DDR5, best bet is second hand with these prices. 16GB is risky if you plan to upgrade later to 32 as they need to both be compatible, but single channel can work in a pinch theres a bunch of Youtube vids comparing the difference.",Negative

Intel,it will be a long time my guy since ai are  thriving taking over now,Negative
Intel,"Well, if you have the budget, the parts you mentioned sound like a good upgrade path that will work perfectly with your new GPU :)  Plus, once you sell what you currently own, you'll offset some of the costs, so it'll actually be a 300 euro upgrade. Btw, 16GB of RAM is enough for the majority of games, so go for that to start. Once you have some money down the line, sell the 16 GB and get a dual kit of 32 GB",Positive

Intel,Id figure,Neutral
Intel,So it has to be what 6000+ and anything below CL36?,Neutral
Intel,"Not true.  OP would see decent benefit from even a 7600.  Most people don't know about EXPO profiles and don't use them, and they are off by default.  As long as it isn't 4800 CL56 or something, OP will be fine.  And AMD is pretty stable on DDR5, now.  5600 CL40 is the fastest JEDEC 5600 bin and should provide good performance.  Will you get better performance with 6000 CL30?  Absolutely.  5-10fps worth of performance?  Not even close.  A R5 7600 is still about a 15% CPU improvement over the R5 5600.  A R5 9600X is near 30% improvement.  Is it worth the cost of CPU, motherboard AND memory, though?  I don't know.  But if you are getting decent game play, I wouldn't worry about it.  EDIT:  For clarification, when I say ""Not even close"", I mean that going from slower RAM to faster RAM will NOT give you a 5-10fps uplift.  It might be 1fps at best and only noticeable in benchmark scores.  You are NOT going to ""kneecap"" a 7600 with slower memory.  Running a single stick of memory would be far worse than running 2 sticks of slower memory.",Neutral

Intel,Well if you’re spending that amount anyway then of course am5 makes more sense for longevity.

Intel,does OLED use more gpu than IPS? I wasn't aware,Neutral
Intel,"The features depend on what you want, 4k or 1440p? 240 or 165hz or higher? Dual mode (it can switch between 2 different resolutions on the fly, each with their own refresh rate). Yes, OLED has some quirks, burn in being one of them, the panels themselves can be more finicky with grey banding, flicker from VRR, but as with anything else you buy getting a dud is unavoidable. Might I suggest looking at the aw3425dw, it's a qdoled (quantum dot OLED)? I'm currently using one and it's been great so far. It has a 3yr burn in warranty from Dell, comes color calibrated from Dell and if you get it from best buy you can get their warranty as well, which imo is worth it as they've been very good at either replacing the item or giving you the amount you bought it for in store credit to go towards a similar item. Every panel is going to have its issues but if you want to chat about it, send me a message and I'll gladly go through some things with you.",Neutral
Intel,"Price. Features. Connectivity.  So from top of my head, the 2026 monitors have: •stripe pixels for better text •true black 500 vs 400 •more scratch resistant screen •better oled care features •darker screen and less purple glow   Then decide how much curve you want for immersion and if you want optional stuff like KVM or more HDMI/dp ports.  At the moment, I don't trust Samsung QC or warranty and have read a few bad things about MSI too. But this also probably comes down to your own country.",Neutral
Intel,"I'm sadly not too versed in the subject, from what I've seen OLED has some issues, the biggest being burn in.  mini led seems like a great alternative and can be significantly cheaper so I'm looking into that. some good monitors (ktc, AOC) can be had for 200€ where I am, ultrawide options are sadly limited and the cheap ones I've seen aren't that great.",Negative

I'm good with 165+ as my main game is Monster Hunter Wilds and I wouldn't be reaching much past this anyway on ultra settings in 1440P.  Ironically, I have an ultrawide Alienware (AW3420DW - IPS panel at 120hz) that I got back in 2020. It's been great, so I'm 100% into the idea of leaning on Alienware for my upgrade. I've seen the AW3423DW & DWF topping charts in the past few years and just recently learned about the 2025 version which you're referencing! I don't think I have a preference on QD-OLED vs WOLED, so I'm good with the QD.  The 2023 version seems to have the DW & DWF, and the only difference I can tell between the two (besides \~$150) is that the DW has a 240hz refresh rate and .03ms response rate, whereas the DWF has a 165hz and .1ms response rate.   These are both negligible to me, so I'd prefer the cheaper version. But I'm *only* seeing the DW for the 2025 version and no DWF alternative.  I'm curious if I can find a 25DW for any cheaper than $750. That's actually the price I bought my current monitor at back in 2020 (and on a 20% discount, believe it not). So I'm into the idea -- just curious if it goes for cheaper or there are any other Alienware OLED ultrawides on the horizon.  Thanks for your response!",Neutral

Personally, after having gamed on this monitor for a few days, I'm absolutely in love with it. Or, if you're by a best buy see what open box options they have, I've had good luck with open box monitors from them and it helps being able to pick up their warranty for it as well.

Intel,Arc raiders is very CPU heavy and the 5700x3d is a good chunk faster closer to am5 non x3d parts. If you're running like medium settings chasing high frames the extra cost is worth it imo.   3 week old testing has a 5800xt which is a bit better than a 5700X but even still the 5700 x3d takes a solid lead of 22.6% on average. With a 39% lead in arc raiders 192 FPS Vs 138. And 1% lows of 125 Vs 90. https://youtu.be/c7Au9Lb5Kw4?si=q33_25u-YlvEe3QU   Testing from launch has a wider amount of cpus. There is a 19% advantage to the 5700 x3d Vs 5700x. https://youtu.be/MU-jUtrfANA?si=yy-Fg_6TfnuGedWm  So what we see is overtime the x3d CPUs pull further ahead of there non x3d counterparts. Arc raiders in particular is a very CPU heavy game which showed a close to 40% gap and as the 5700x is slower than a 5800 xt especially in multicore workloads that can leverage the increased tdp and base clock I imagine the gap will be greater still.  Also x3d CPUs care less about memory speed and 3000 MHz is sub optimal and will further increase the gap between these processors.,Positive

To see any noticeable performance improvement, you're gonna need a CPU upgrade 100%.   Whether the 5700X3D is worth $200 more, thats up to you, but I dont think its worth it, when the 5700X or 5800XT will perform massively better than your 2700x.  5700X3D is expensive because its no longer in production, so whatever brand new stock still exists is going to stay expensive as retail supply slowly dwindles.  100% more money for less than 20% more performance is not great.",Negative

Clock Speeds: The 5700X3D has lower base (3.0 GHz) and boost (4.1 GHz) clocks than the 5700X (3.4 GHz base / 4.6 GHz boost).  Power/Thermal: The 5700X3D is a 105W TDP chip, requiring better cooling, whereas the 5700X is a more efficient 65W chip.   Which to Buy?  Choose the 5700X3D if: You are gaming, particularly at 1080p or 1440p, or using a high-end GPU, and want to extend the life of your AM4 platform.  Choose the 5700X if: You are on a strict budget, doing more productivity work than gaming, or want a lower-power, cooler system.

If thats not enough for you, you might want to try to get a used 5600, that wont be very expensive and a good upgrade.  If performance works fine for you without a new CPU, I would suggest to then just wait till AM6 and by then just upgrade completely to a new platform.",Neutral

Intel,"Intel GPUs have come a long way, and part of that journey was from A to B. The current lineup are th B series and are regarded as significantly better than the A series. I recommend B580 GPUs for gamers on a budget. It's a good card, and most of the a series issues are gone. Drivers work, upscaling happens, compatability is good.  tldr: Current Intel GPUs are fine, just avoid the A-series",Positive
Intel,"A580? Nah not that much, the RX 6600 and RTX 3050 are the same price and generally either have better better performance or better tech, both have better optimization, the Arc B580 though, absolutely as it has good drivers and is on the same level as a 4060 for a lower price",Positive

Intel,"You just gotta look up reveiws that include color accuracy. For example Rtings does them and have a decent library or reviews, including the 2715H which actually didn't score that well in color accuracy, the reviewer noting warmer than ideal color temperature.  Gaming monitors can be very accurate, if the manufacturers bother to calibrate them. That's honestly why I wouldn't ever buy a monitor without reading an in-depth review first, just reading the specifications isn't nearly enough.   Since Dell makes dedicated gaming monitors as Alienware, I doubt the Ultrasharp line will have a satisfactory response time for 120hz, but again, you'd have to see a review first.",Neutral
Intel,If you want color accuracy then get a colorimeter and calibrate your monitor.,Neutral
Intel,">I'm bothered by the fake, vomity, blue-ish color so much  Have you tried using the OSD to adjust the monitor to your liking?  You can change the color temp to something warmer and you're basically all set.  You can improve color accuracy by using a custom calibration that you can either find online, or calibrate it yourself with a good colorimeter (but these are expensive).  The best monitors for color accuracy are going to basically any OLED display at this point. But they will need even some minor fiddling in the OSD to get the best out of them since most will default to some ""gaming"" or ""vivid"" preset out of the box. Thats how my PG27AQWP-W came out as. Had to go into the OSD to change from Gaming to TrueBlack500 to get better overall accurate colors and better overall looking HDR.",Neutral
Intel,"It all depends on what your usage and budget will be. OLEDs are a very good choice and they offer now more and more protection against burn-in. As for reading fatigue, not everyone is affected the same way. If your main usage is gaming, OLED are tough to beat but if you are doing 50/50 gaming/work, then reading fatigue can be a factor. The ASUS ROG Swift OLED PG27UCDM and the Dell Alienware AW2725Q are both good OLED choices in a mix usage. Or you can go with the Acer Nitro XV275K P5biipruzx for an non-OLED monitor. You can always change the settings in the OSD to how the monitors looks the best to you, if you don't have access to a calibration tool. Like others are saying, sometimes just changing the Color Temperature in the OSD makes a big difference.",Positive
Intel,"I thought OSD settings was a half-assed way to adjust the colors? Am I wrong? I figured the manufacturer would optimize the default color settings and any adjustments after would be cope.  I'm also not sure about 4K. I'm barely getting 120fps with DLSS & FrameGen at 1440p, so any larger would negate the benefits unless I upgrade (which is a hard ask today). Windows DPI scaling is also a toss-up even today. I heard 4K is better for text though. Is 4K a must?  (edit: My local store has a ROG XG27AQWMG if that's worth anything)",Neutral

Intel,pick up a used 5700x and a 9060xt / 5060ti.   Don't go wasting money on a 5080.      And chill.... you don't NEED 144hz to survive.,Neutral
Intel,"You should upgrade your CPU & GPU, what is your country and maximum budget for an upgrade? What is your budget for a new build?",Neutral
Intel,will your motherboard support a 5700X and DDR4 3200 memory (if that's not what you already have).    If so you'd be fine to get a new cpu and and GPU (provided your PSU can handle the load.... 50 series cards are thirsty.   If your MB is going to have issued (doesn't support pcie gen4x16 then I'd think about a whole new system...  But RAM cost is HUGE!!!!  so maybe upgrading everything around your existing DDR4 ram is a better option?,Neutral
Intel,"I would say upgrade the cpu since that game is cpu intensive. Your gpu is fine honestly  5700x/5800x/5800xt are all fine options, just choose based on what the pricing is in your area",Positive
Intel,"Your first question to yourself should really be ""what is my budget?""  Otherwise, we'd all be scrapping our rigs and building new ones every 3-6 months",Neutral
Intel,First question is - what is your budget .? 5700x CPU + 9060xt GPU or 9070 non xt . Very good performance increase,Positive
Intel,"Either upgrade to a 5800x/xt and grab a new GPU, grab a microcenter or newegg bundle, or find a prebuilt",Neutral
Intel,[This video](https://youtu.be/oF3gLKmYqpE?si=If70o-_RamZOxXJS) suggests the upgraded GPU will have the desired effect even if there is some performance left on the table. This might now be a bad thing as when the (if!) price of RAM comes back down I can upgrade the rest and keep the GPU.,Neutral
Intel,5700x3d/5800x/5800x3d would be a good upgrade,Positive
Intel,"That's the CPU I have. I upgraded to it at the beginning of last year. My system is a 5800XT paired with a 5070 TI and 32gb of DDR4. It does everything that I want it it, in the resolution and fps that I want. Except for Tarkov. It looks great, but without Smooth Motion, I'm only getting 70-100 fps with maxed out settings on most maps.  I actually just recently upgraded to the 5070 TI, from a 3080. Nice jump. I think later this year, I am going to upgrade to AM5 and I really want an X3D chip, so probably the new 9850X3D. I'm also going to shoot for 64gb of DDR5, unless it's still $1k. Lol!",Positive
Intel,"That would mean spending £200ish on the CPU, and then £1000 On the GPU and a couple hundred on the PSU. A new 5080 pre-built is around £2k.",Neutral
Intel,UK. We have very few options for walk in PC component shopping.      Around £1000.,Neutral
Intel,r/usdefaultism,Neutral
Intel,No but if my 3060 isn't hitting that at 1080p what hope does it have for 1440?,Neutral
Intel,"If the solution is a complete build I'll hold fire while I save as I don't want to buy a new machine that's less capable than I'd like.      My first PC was a budget option and I've been duct taping new components onto that ever since. Next time I want to get the top of the range out the gate.

Intel,How much ram do you have in your current build?,Neutral
Intel,It is what it is,Neutral
Intel,"That’s why I suggested a 5700x too.   As you move up the resolutions, the GPU has less of an impact on performance jumps.",Neutral
Intel,"You can cheaply duck tape it like, for sure! Although, I think the middle ground between cheap upgrades and a New Build is the smart choice.     Upgrading your CPU to a 5600(x)/5700x/5800x/5700x3D would get your better performance on your current hardware. The 5600 is £90 right now.     Upgrading your GPU to support your new 1440p monitor with something like a 9070 XT and a new 850w PSU(unless you have a recent/decent psu). You can also get a cheaper GPU, the 9060 XT 16gb/5060 Ti 16gb are way faster than the 3060.      Doing these specific upgrades would allow you to take your GPU and PSU to your next build. With the GPU+PSU already purchased, you would just need a Case, storage, CPU/MoBo/RAM.    Buying the CPU/GPU/PSU now will get you the best performance for the least amount of money. I strongly recommend you do this, then plan to upgrade the CPU/MoBo/RAM within 2 years.

Intel,Perhaps naively I'm drawn to nVidia.,Neutral
Intel,"tldr: Much faster for gaming, espcially cpu intensive games  They have extra 3dvcache so the cpu can run more efficiently, which translates to faster performance for gaming. Just see where the x3d's rank in terms of gaming.  https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/cpu-hierarchy,4312-2.html'  Heres a specific benchmark for 5700x3d in arc raiders. Vastly improved 1% lows, 1% lows is the lowest fps you will see. Thats when theres alot going on in game and your performance stutters, so having better 1% lows will prevent that from happening   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzk6J09n\_A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzk6J09n_A)",Positive
Intel,"Yeah, you could get away with a 5700x3d or 5800x3d. Sell your 3800x. Then as long as your PSU is up for it, throw a 5070ti or 5080 in there.  I was rocking a 5700x3d with a 4080 super until just recently. I only upgraded to a 9800x3d setup because I got a killer deal on the CPU/Mobo/Ram combo. Performance doesn’t really feel much different at 1440p/UHD.  I’d check FB marketplace for the CPU upgrade.",Neutral
Intel,My monitor arrived today. I'm gonna hook that up and see how I get on.      There's a place selling the Ryzen 7 5800XT for under £200 so if I feel I need some more oomph I'll try that first. Gives me a base to upgrade more if I need to and hopefully weather the RAM storm.,Positive
Intel,32GB is enough ram for now. Use browser extensions and browser settings to unload unused tabs automatically and save used memory.,Neutral
Intel,"So I'm still hitting a high enough frame rate, really. My CPU isn't even at 50%. Does this mean a higher end GPU would be fine with this chip? Or just that increasing the CPU alone isn't going to give me much of a benefit?    Also, OLED is crazy.",Negative
Intel,"You’ll feel a difference between a 3800x and a 57/800x3d. However most of that will in the form of smoothing out 1% lows.  So one of the things I try to do with my upgrades is consider current pricing vs what I can get for my existing components. There is a bit of an art form in reselling your old components before they hit obsolescence.  This is probably the strongest argument for a 9800/9850x3d upgrade. Since your current rig is still desirable, you’ll get significantly more for it now compared to when AMD launches the next gen after the 9K series.  Recommendations are also game dependent. For instance, if you mainly only play Blizzard games, an upgrade won’t really feel much different than what you have now. In my case, I play all kinds of games, some demanding some not. I’m also on a 32:9 ultrawide. Some games I play on half screen (shout out to Borderless Gaming app on Steam), some I play at full 32:9 like BF6.  I guess what I’m saying is that this is a bit of a complicated decision with multiple variables that weigh differently for each person. I hope my yammering helps you to get a complete picture and allow you to make a better informed decision.",Neutral
Intel,6600XT is still good for 1080p and perfectly matched with your CPU and PSU. For $400 you will not find anything significantly better (new). For used market it is hard to suggest because prices vary widely. I suggest  to save money for new build while using the existing system.,Positive

To me I was like yea it’s a hobby there’s nothing wrong with paying a lot of money for a hobby you love and enjoy. I feel like it hit him pretty hard with the realization that it can be a hobby cause he didn’t say anything back but he had this look and energy of “oh shit that’s true.” To him lol,Positive

Intel,"Honestly that’s a super solid starting list. A 7800X3D + 32GB RAM + 2TB SSD is basically a dream setup for gaming.  Only thing I’d say is the RTX 5060 might be the weak spot for a $1500–$1700 budget. If you can bump that up to something like a 4070 Super / 5070, you’ll get way more value and it’ll last longer.  For the rest, you don’t need to overthink it too much — just grab a decent B650 board, a good 750W gold PSU, and a solid air cooler and you’re set.

Intel,"Im not sure what your idea of obsolete is. Right now I play modern games with a Radeon HD 7900 3GB card that was manufactured around 15 years ago. It handles many games on high settings without issue. I just ordered an 8GB card as an upgrade a few weeks ago and plan to use it for at least 5 years. Thats plenty future proof for me. Running every new game that comes out on max settings is not an industry standard, most people are on too tight a budget to keep up with that.",Neutral
Intel,"1080p or 1440p firstly? Also if you are running Brand new games - Space marine 2/ Total war/ Battlefield. A lot of those games cannot reach 30/60Fps on these systems. Some quite literally are unplayable. My best guideline is Steam requirements, 8gb is standard, up from 6gb circa 2016. I’m not saying this with absolution, I’m merely stating that the GC will ultimately become obsolete before a 16GB card does. If you were paying double to go from 8-16GB, I can see more of the reasoning there.",Negative

Intel,"Current gen game comes out with higher system requirements. Do you assume next gen game will be same graphics/design. Your system according to STEAM AND BATTLEFIELD (Frostbite I think) have just made your card obsolete. Can you still play it at 1080 on low at 30fps, sure.

This is why im upgrading to 8GB. If you say 8GB is a standard from 5 years ago, then why are so many games coming out right now recommending 8GB?

Motherboard you can skimp out on, power supply just prefer gold standard, and I’d even argue against Corsair ram sticks, may save a bit going Kingston/Gskill, you just won’t get little ship on them.

Intel,"Hello :) Intel Arc isn’t the same as Iris Xe. Arc is newer, and it’s usually noticeably better for graphics.  Out of these three, I’d pick the **HP ProBook (Core Ultra + Arc)**, it’s the most “future proof” option, and ProBooks are generally better built. About the HP hinge issue, it’s mostly a problem on some cheaper consumer models, it can still happen, but ProBooks are usually a safer bet. If you want the simplest “no worries” specs out of the box, the **MSI** is also a solid choice because it already has **16GB RAM and 1TB storage**.",Positive
Intel,Thanks man ;),Positive
Intel,"i personally use a xeon e5 2650 v4 with  the motherboard being the x99 pr9-h eith a gtx 1070, but i dont personally play arc raiders",Neutral
Intel,">CPU/MOBO/RAM was a flash sale on the AliExpress app that I snagged for the criminal amount of $31 shipped.  Yeah, the ram alone is 2/3 of the budget otherwise.",Neutral
Intel,"I just got the case, I flipped the right most top fan to be intake to better CPU temps",Positive
Intel,Please dont use a xeon for gaming. This one has a low single core score but you need a high single core score for gaming.,Negative
Intel,"What performance are you actually getting with this? I have an i5 6600k and RTX3070 and wasn't entirely happy with performance in arc raiders being that my CPU was the minimum spec. I don't see how an even older weaker CPU would be a fun experience, although maybe we have different standards?",Negative
Intel,With the insane prices of RAM now I would think prices on these LGA2011-3 chips are going to sink even further. That said most new games really want threads and these Xeons really keep up.,Negative
Intel,Highly recommend if you’ve been looking for a shooter,Neutral
Intel,"Arc raiders is already in my gaming hall of fame. Which is Desert Combat (BF 1942 Mod), Halo 3, and PUBG. It’s top top top tier fun",Positive
Intel,It's the first game in years that has really pulled me in. Before that I'd play games but it'd usually be on my old favorites and not much of anything new.  I had played The Finals for a bit so it was very familiar control-wise. That's free if you want to check out performance and see if a similar playstyle seems fun. The Finals is more twitchy and also TF2 like though.,Positive
Intel,It sucks for us but it really sucks for PC gamers in less developed nations. This kind of setup is very prevalent in South America and Eastern Europe. Now they have no path for a cheap rig anymore. RAM and NVMe prices have shut them out.,Negative
Intel,I considered it with a regular dual fan GPU dumping hot air in the case but with the blower style GPU cooler the CPU tops out at 65C when doing both CPUz stress test and furmark. GPU hits 98C during that but it’s expected.,Neutral
Intel,"It's not 2017 anymore. Games use threads like crazy. I used a 6650XT with one of these CPUs before selling it in another rig and played NBA 2K25 (same as on console) at 120FPS+, and well as the Finals on 720P low at 120FPS+. I'm getting 85FPS+ 1080P (FSR to 720) on Arc Raiders with this setup.   Plays games perfectly.   Here's this exact CPU with an RX 6600. Has the same dips my 5950X has when new arc or players pop in.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuDCxnhdH\_k&t=86s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuDCxnhdH_k&t=86s)",Neutral
Intel,"I don't know what made you think this CPU was less powerful in anything but a single threaded benchmark. Arc Raiders uses 16+ cores. The Passmark for this CPU is 17.2kpts and the 6600K is 6.3kpts. In the 5th photo in my post I had put a passmark score for the two minimum, this CPU and the two recommended. This game will use every thread it can.  Here I'm on the practice range, graphics set to 1080P with FSR set to quality (\~720P). In fullscreen mode the CPU usage goes back and forth between 40-52%. GPU isn't even near full utilization so this is taxing the CPU and not the GPU.   Take a look in the bottom of the steam overlay. That CPU percentage is treating hyperthreaded cores as real cores and you're able to see all 28 threads from the 14 core CPU. 57% CPU usage is 114% real core usage, or 15.96 fully loaded cores worth to get 112fps. In game it's more around 75-90fps 1080 FSR quality mode.  https://preview.redd.it/tedxnm2ijzhg1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b8ed94ec92b99d4c5b52ca3cc3d2770d628df18",Neutral

Intel,Oh hell yeah. Nothing was better for my addiction issues than getting an i9 14900 cpu requiring me to get a damn minor in engineering (fixing the vdroop compensation and tuning load lines with CEP enabled) In order to have the chip function as efficient as possible and taking my mind away from the substance abuse issues to becoming obsessed with something less destructive (other than to my power bill) way to go on 4 years sobriety!,Positive
Intel,Never forget to reward yourself,Neutral
Intel,TIL Intel has its own high end GPU line. I'm amazed I never saw it before. Can any owners confirm how it runs? The marketing sure makes it feel like if you don't have Nvidia or AMD you might as well not have a GPU considering how important AI driver optimization is now,Neutral
Intel,Intel is making a real shot at the gpu market.  Im happy to see it.  Congrats on your upgrade,Positive
Intel,"To give my honest input, hopefully you mostly play recent mainstream games where Intel cares to prioritize bug fixes and improvements. Old games that use DirectX 9 (or even older) can result in quirks but it depends on the game, e.g. Half-Life 2 works, but The Settlers 2 may have quirks, etc. Nvidia's drivers have decades of driver workarounds for more games than most of us know, which can make it relevant for some people.  So as advice to help you feel good and confident about your purchase without possible regrets, test all the games (new and old) that you play or would play rather sooner than later. If they run well and all is OK, then you are golden. Just mentioning this in case you may end up running into niche problems and are past the return period or something. Much success and have fun.",Positive

Intel,thank you 🙏,Positive
Intel,For me it dropped 10W while on 3440x1440@144 but at 60Hz it’ll do sub 10W idle for the whole card.   Without ASPM you are looking at 40W idle.

Intel,"DLSS is Nvidia proprietary. There is an Intel equivalent called XeSS and it actually worked quite well when I tested it in few of the games I played (for e.g. cyberpunk, expedition 33). It is comparable to Radeon's FSR, there are plenty of YouTube videos comparing the 3 standards.  In practice it depends on the game but IMO DLSS is a little bit better than the other two, and with wider support. But for me raw non AI performance and cheaper price (and dislike for NVIDIA practices) made the trade-off worth going with Intel",Positive
Intel,Is this only for Intel cards or does this work for any GPU brand?,Neutral
Intel,Thanks! I habe a b580 and noticed it always ifles at 50c😂. Should I use the L0 or L1 option? Theres also an option that says L0 ans L1...,Neutral
Intel,How much do you predict a gpu would save power bill wise if zero rpm fan mode were enabled vs disabled ? I always disable it because I figure it’s easier to leave the fans running at 20% 90% of the time then 0% and ramping the fans up dozens of times per day on and off and save the fan bearings long term but maybe I’m wrong.,Neutral
Intel,"That makes sense.   I have one of the most expensive 5090s available, and if I leave it in adaptive power mode so that the fans can stop spinning I get hardcore driver crashes.   GG NVIDIA and ASUS",Negative
Intel,Redoing all the bios is one of my biggest pet peeves.,Negative
Intel,"you made it look like a choice, but there is no choice really is it. B580 is worse than both a 5060ti or a 9060xt, so if you're looking for actual computational power I wouldn't put it as Intel being an actual contender, since it has no ""flagship"" options. Maybe for the price point Intel may be worth compared to it's counterparts from AMD/Nvidia, but even then the software the other two bring, and most importantly nvidia make the card better",Negative
Intel,AMD and Nvidia have their own thing going in the driver. Iirc currently it's only Intel who is following established industry standards in this regard.,Neutral
Intel,Nvidia cards literally have a switch on the GPU itself for quiet mode and performance mode.,Neutral
Intel,The linked support page mentions L1 is required to be enabled.,Neutral
Intel,Spinning up and down was a concern with old harddrives but with modern bearings and thus with modern fans it really isn’t anymore.  Usually the bearings have an hour rating and every time the fan isn’t spinning it won’t wear on the bearing.    If you don’t change the fan curve then the main power saving isn’t the power the fans use but the reduced GPU power that allows 0 rpm in the first place.,Neutral
Intel,screenshots of all setting,Neutral
Intel,"[""Established industry standards"".](https://xkcd.com/927/)",Neutral
Intel,"So a gigabyte gaming oc 9070xt would you recommend I use zero rpm fan mode? The temps are so low with this card the gpu never goes above 51c under load 81c hotspot and idles with the fans on at 28c with no fans l think it idles around 40c, I care less about saving on my power bill and more about making the card and its 3 95mm fans last the next 10 years if possible, I do keep it undervolted with -0.100mv negative offset and  power limits -20% (8 % less performance and when over 140-160fps I don’t notice the difference without telemetry)",Negative
Intel,A must.,Neutral
Intel,"ASPM is in the spec since PCIe 2.0, so for 19 years now. I’d call that established.",Neutral
Intel,I personally do it mostly to silence the system when idle.    You can always replace just the fans (or ziptie Noctua 92mm fans with a adapter) if you want to use the card longer. So I wouldn’t worry about wear too much.,Neutral

Intel,Quick tip for people considering x99: the e5 16xx are slightly nicer for gaming while costing less than the 269x cpus.    There are some 26xx that outperforms though and it depends on your locations deals.   Nice build though. Super solid for 1080p gaming. X99 has really held up.,Positive

Intel,You can unlock the v3 for overclocking though. Definitely a benefit if your cooler/psu can take 140w++.,Neutral
Intel,"Ok, I’m glad I wasn’t the only one a bit curious about that. I have a server running E5-2683v4’s and it also uses DDR4",Positive
Intel,"Definitely. If you can get some cheap DDR4 ECC (They are not compatible with DDR3), they make a good build.",Positive
Intel,For gaming? Probably i7 4790 plus a few extra cores good.   Maybe ryzen 1st gen level.,Positive

Intel,"Yep, thanks to feature unlocks made in the bios, that ship on China x99 boards. this can be enabled.",Positive
Intel,Can't really compare since a kit of DDR5 64gb would cost more than the total build. there's gaming screenshots attached.,Neutral
Intel,-50/-50/-60 is the undervolt I used.,Neutral
Intel,He is using frame gen on almost all the titles.,Neutral
Intel,True. Forgot about that. DDR4 RDIMMs were super cheap last year. Now it's like $20 for 8gb. Kinda sad I sold my 24gb extra early. Could get like $60 now...,Negative
Intel,"Yeah, if I remember it scores slightly faster than a 1800x in single core",Positive
Intel,"In multicore yes, because it has a shitton of cores to compensate lower clocks, but the moment it has to play a semi-modern game that only uses 1-4 cores it falls apart very quickly.",Negative
Intel,"Thanks, somehow I missed the only part I cared about.",Neutral
Intel,Sounds about right. The cache helps for gaming too.,Positive
Intel,"It is interesting to see as my 5600G scores 11285 in R23 multi and 1434 in single, so the massive Xeon is 10% slower multi and almost half the performance in single core with using double the amount of power. Still very capable for a decent amount of loads, but as you say it tanks for gaming. Great it has all the RAM bandwidth you could ever desire as well as PCIe lanes up the wazoo, but for most consumers we never use those. I would like to try one out just for fun, see what it actually is like using it, but I can't really find a use case for it.",Positive

Intel,"Medium, and xess on balanced is over 60 fps at 1440p. Framegen just smooths it out.",Neutral
Intel,"Single core is it's biggest problem, and actually the architecture itself. People don't realise that these old high end chips are great for budget builds, but they consume a lot of power for the performance, and the instruction sets won't allow for some programs to run, orthey will run but slow due to some instructions have to be simulated.   Around 2020 I used to recommend cheap X99 bundles on Newegg or Ali to people on a budget, but knowing that for the same 55 dollars you can pick up a Ryzen 5 3600 or just spend less on RGB and get a 3700X for 100$ than I can not see the purpose of these old Xeons and 1-6th gen Intel builds.",Negative
Intel,"This was to build something cheap with readily available parts showing it can game. 32gb of DDR4 costs the more than what i paid for the CPU/MB/Ram here.  I have access to much faster components, this was more of a ""curiosity"" build.",Neutral
Intel,"Thanks, it made me question my rig and it's performances",Positive
Intel,"Give me a title to run, remember, i'm also handicaped with an A770.",Neutral
Intel,"Exactly. I use a parts bin system as a multimedia PC and that one really struggles with missing instruction sets. I hardly ever hit that wall, but if I do there is nothing you can do to solve it. It really is the price of DDR4 that is killing the 3600(X) route, otherwise that would be such a great bargain right now.",Negative
Intel,"Thatś why I am happy I got my 5600G built done with 32GB when it was under €100. I could have made the build even cheaper, but it was about the cheapest I could get for the performanceis gives me. With the same SSDs, 770, I would have ended up around the same price as what you paid. I went with different priorities.  Now the same RAM kit is €285, clearly that plan would instantly fail pushing towards Xeon systems hard. Don´t get me wrong, I have a soft spot for builds like this, but unless the market is wonky, they kind of never make much sense unless you are in an area where prices are terrible anyways. I think it looks really good for a curiosity buid as well. Plus, gaming on great hardware fun, but you expect it to perform wellfor the price you paid for it. There is nothing better than messing around with the underdog and seeing how much you can squeeze from it.  I wonder where you even found DDR3 64GB for $40 as those prices also went up a lot in the lastfew days/weeks. I see similar kits nearing €200 already and that is just insane.",Positive
Intel,Facebook market place. He even gave me 2 sticks of 8gb ECC because he couldn't be bothered listing them. lol     My 4090 is looking at me wondering why i'm tinkering with this old stuff,Negative
Intel,That is a great deal to find. That makes a lot of difference in the total cost. Getting a spare set because he couldn't be bothered is icing on the cake.,Positive

Intel,"I've had the AW3225QF for just about 2 years now, it's been great.  I work from home and use it for work, so lots of OLED no-no type images. I do run the pixel refresh during lunch.  My one complaint would be malware level of software this thing will force upon you if you use Windows.  When I still did, nothing would stop it. Set it to not get updates from Windows Update, turning off driver updates in group policy, etc. Uninstall, a few days later it would just reappear. I had to resort to leaving the folders behind and making them read only.  I would say that it released 2 years ago so I'd probably look at newer models if I was shopping around again.",Positive
Intel,new looks empty with that 2-slot gpu.  and the rear exhaust doesnt really work. aio will dump all the air before anything reaches there.,Negative
Intel,Server time,Neutral
Intel,I'll believe them (either Intel or AMD) when I see the benchmarks.  Until then this is all just pointless noise.,Neutral
Intel,well yeah you can't compare them because strix halo is on a signficantly larger die wheras panther lake is more comparable to something like the hx370.   If amd is able to get strix halo at a competitive price then sure it will compete but the issue is that with such a large die I don't think it is possible for them to compete in price with panther lake,Neutral
Intel,I’ll never understand why AMD is not committing to design RDNA4 based APUs and at this point I just take RDNA 3.5 as a joke because they can’t even support FSR4 on it officially nor the RX 7000 cards.  It’s like they are losing on purpose,Negative
Intel,"AMD has this “it’s good enough for a while and we’ll release something great that people will forget this happened”  Vega lasted in mobile for nearly 5 years and got RDNA2 designs. Now, it’s RDNA3.5 being built for mobile platform and betting on that to be good enough until RDNA5/UDNA bridge die designs releases (unverified rumor)  AMD also has this weird obsession with competitor naming. Sure, it’s meant to confuse buyers but it’s hurting them than helping, maybe it does help in terms of inventory.  They’re not intel-like of stagnation. They’re competing but not for us in the consumer market and we’re just getting scraps until enterprise trend die down (currently AI trend/bubble).  Well, it’s understandable as Zen designs are really focused in Epyc and scale down to Ryzen SKUs.  And the 400 series is a bad refresh when Ryzen 6000 mobile is the definitive refresh they have done, Zen 3+ and move to RDNA2. AMD could’ve done similar commitment but it’s not currently.  Also, AMD forgor Strix Halo laptops are still nowhere to be found aside from 1 or 2",Neutral
Intel,"Except that the B390 will be far more common as it will be seen in far more laptops. Yes, the 8060S & 8050s can be found in some laptops, but for the laptops you'll find in places like Currys, Best Buy or Mediamarkt, the B390 will be the most powerful iGPU you'll likely find & it'll happily outdo a Radeon 890M",Positive

Intel,Meanwhile AMD keeps putting out new chips with years old GPUs.,Neutral
Intel,Core Ultra 2 is already a better mobile soc.  I don't know why AMD thinks 12-16 cores is more important than battery life when it comes to laptops.,Neutral
Intel,The Intel igpu has a better upscaler by far. FSR3.1 is a third class competitor in comparison. People have been crying out for AMD to release FSR4 for RDNA3.5 but AMD has some seriously stupid execs in charge.,Negative
Intel,It does sound complacent but ultimately the proof is in the pudding.,Neutral
Intel,"If it is not even fair to compare (because Strix Halo is WAY more watts) then why is AMD comparing them? B390 will exist, Strix Halo virtually does not in laptops.",Negative

Intel,"strix halo is nice and all, but too prohibitively expensive to be considered for many people  arc b390/b370 will be available in much cheaper products for which amd doesn't have a proper answer to atm. amd's next lineup can't be lazy if they want to stay competitive",Negative
Intel,"The GPU doesn't matter if you don't have proper drivers and they are so far behind still Intel.   Great progress, but the drivers are still going to be the thing that makes people say no.   If intel keeps on chugging away and they work with all the DirectX games backwards and going forward.   I'm talking past DirectX games, you can't just worry about the new games there's games that are older that don't run well.   It took AMD many many years to get decent drivers, Intel I don't know if they're just focusing on hardware and not the drivers, but that so far is what's been holding it back.   Hopefully they can release a true dedicated GPU back in rival something that's out there at a much better price that will bring at least some competition back until the AI scam is over.",Negative
Intel,Panther Lake is using a superior process technology. So they are right. But it doesn't matter as customer will choose what's better. But until AMD has something out that uses 2nm then yes they will be behind probably,Neutral
Intel,I hope Intel stays competitive and AMD also brings its best to the table.,Positive
Intel,They should be worried about DLSS 4.5 though. Fix stuttering on FSR 4 and improve image quality,Neutral
Intel,I just wish Intel would make a very cut down panther lake offering to be the successor to the N1xx/N3xx line of efficient chips that have found their way into mini PCs.,Neutral

Intel,"Yeah it's old architechture, that's the point, Intel moved to the lastest node and barely manages to eek out a win. A win is a win nonetheless, but AMD still have plenty to dials to turn up.",Neutral
Intel,"I don't understand the fuss about iGPUs? Like why do they assume the average Joe would care about an IGPU at all? That's maybe 5% of the market and even then...most of them would get a dGPU anyways.  And apart from the GPU, what's special about the CPU? Combining (Lunar Lake) efficiency with (Arrow Lake) power? Sorry but my Ryzen AI 7 350 does that already. The top of the line x9 388h is about ~10% faster in single core aka the only thing that matters and will probably be in 2500€+ laptops whereas my 7 350 is in 500€ laptops.  I tried a 285h laptop besides the AI 7 350 and not only did it run hotter and less efficient, it also felt less snappier.    And the AI 7 350 was designed as a Lunar Lake competitor anyways so it was never worse in efficiency and ahead of Arrow Lakes like the 255h in that regard.  So I don't see why anything should really change...?",Negative
Intel,"AMD doesn't want to bring RDNA 4 to APUs, so as not to give FSR4 to users other than those with dedicated GPUs.",Neutral
Intel,a brand new product on a newer node is better than an older product on an older node?! who knew?,Neutral
Intel,"And the price. I used to be an AMD fan, but as soon as competition with Intel was gone, AMD raised their prices and now act as if they believe they are a luxury brand. Hope Intel gets back into the game and if Intel can slash their prices it might end-up being the right choice.  At the same price, Intel is dead on arrival. At a serious discount they will take the place of AMD. No one is buying Strix Halo for handhelds, it is too expensive.",Neutral
Intel,"Both are right/wrong.  Intel made their comparisons to Strix point because they’re in the same power class. Panther lake is much faster than Strix Point at the same power level (according to Intel, AMD doesn’t deny that) at 45W.  AMD says it doesn’t matter because their Strix halo (up to 120W) is faster which is pretty obvious.   It’s not technically lying, AMD is just referencing an entirely different class of product.",Neutral
Intel,Plenty of folks tested it at CES.  Intel was confident enough to let reporters run benchmarks and it's basically around 4050 level.  You should be able to run most games at 1080p at medium-high settings in an Ultrabook form factor.,Neutral
Intel,"Well lunar lake is a monster and competes directly with the z2e both on performance and efficiency, so no reason to think panther lake will be worse.  Even if it falls short of Intels claims it will still be the leader until next year.",Negative
Intel,The noise is doing a great job advertising for them. A war between them with fighting words will get them tons of free advertising.,Positive
Intel,And a much higher power budget.  AMD says they win because their 120W chip is faster than Intels 45W chip.   No surprise to anyone.,Negative
Intel,"I generally agree but i suspect that the 388h is using a much larger gpu than people suspect. I think its probably ~165mm2 in size, not 55mm2. i suspect the 55mm2 die varient is for the 4xe version, and the 12xe version is 3x that size.  I also dont understand why strix halo is so expensive. It would be interesting to see bom and packaging costs.",Neutral
Intel,"It sounds like RDNA4 just doesn't scale at all. All the rumors point to them going straight from RDNA3.5 to RDNA5 in APUs, just skipping RDNA4 all together.",Negative
Intel,RDNA 3.5 was the only reason I didn’t invest in a STRIX HALO mini PC. The price is too much for outdated unsupported tech.,Negative
Intel,"Might be the same reason they stuck with Vega for so long in APUs.  At the current available desktop memory (DDR4 at the time) an architecture change wouldn't have made a huge difference.    Once DDR5 came out for laptops, we finally saw RDNA 2+ APUs (Ryzen 6000 APUs).  I'd bet once DDR6 starts appearing on laptops we'll get a similar iGPU architecture leap.",Neutral
Intel,"AMD probably just didn't bother making a new APU design when they didn't have new CPU core to go with it. Medusa Halo is rumored for 2027 with Zen 6 and UDNA/RDNA5, so the Point version will likely release then too.",Neutral
Intel,AMD has and always will be their own worst enemy,Negative
Intel,"It's not like they aren't developing something this whole time, releases are planned many years in advanced. Intel will have some rope and then will get inevitably leap frogged",Neutral
Intel,It's not like Intel isn't doing the same. Panther Lake and ARC are holdovers of things developed under Gelsinger.,Neutral
Intel,"> AMD is going to f--- around and let Intel catch up, in CPUs and GPUs.  this is what we actually need: competition. AMD kicked intels butt, now intel is kicking back. it's a win for us either way.",Neutral
Intel,I hope Intel will catch up and encourage AMD to compete. Having cleat leader in CPUs or GPUs is bad for consumers.,Negative
Intel,"I mean, we know that AMD is innovating. They literally showed Zen 6 at CES. Its just not ready yet for mobile, and Intel caught up. Same thing happened with Alder Lake, where intel released that before Zen 4 was ready.",Neutral

They don't care about you, they care about making money and when they have a dominant position they will exploit it.  > At the same price, Intel is dead on arrival. At a serious discount they will take the place of AMD. No one is buying Strix Halo for handhelds, it is too expensive.  Outside of that one device (Ayaneo maybe?), you're right.

Intel,"It's not the 4050 at 60W. The laptop they compared only allows for 30W to the 4050. Nvidia's specs for the 4050 is 35W minimum, so I don't know how Dell even got to 30W. Below a certain wattage, gpu performance decreases exponentially because a minimum level of power is required to even have the gpu turned on.   Panther Lake is built on Intel 18A, which is supposed to be much better than the 'ancient' TSMC 5nm the 4050 is built on. The 4050's cpu is also Arrow Lake, which is less efficient than Lunar Lake. Again, that skews the agenda.   You can already game on thin and light devices with discrete graphics. Laptops like Asus's G14 is only 3.3lb, but sports a 4060 which is like twice as fast as intel's new igpu. The dgpu turns itself off when on battery, and the integrated graphics takes over. Anything more intensive should be used with a charger plugged in.   In short, paying for a big igpu doesn't make much sense for anyone interested in performance. And gaming handhelds? Does anyone really care about those useless bricks for investment into integrated graphics? It's not like the cost of Panther Lake is going to be cheap when its laptops start at $1300. With that kind of money, you can get 2025 Asus Zephyrus G14 with a 5060 and blow its shit out the water. Or for those on a budget, 5050 laptops have been seen for $600.   Integrated graphics have come so far, pairing Intel's newest 18A Panther Lake with an RTX 4050 could still make a lot of sense.",Negative

And even then, having your laptop drained in 2 hours 15 minutes instead of 2 hours is not ""gamechanging""   So it does not affect the efficiency at all during webbrowsing, watching videos, creating documents etc.  Thats also the reason why Intel has the non X 5,7,9 which will properly be by far the more demanded version as, again, the average Joe does not care the slightest about iGPU.

Intel,"How are you determining that AMD has a ""lead""?  In terms of Marketshare, Intel absolutely dominates x86, especially mobility (laptops), and if you walk into a Best Buy and ask 10 random customers ""Would you ever consider buying an AMD laptop?"", five of them would ask ""What's AMD?"", another three would say ""Isn't that a budget brand?"" (Their ""awareness"" of the zeitgeist of PC hardware is stuck in 2005), and maybe, and that's a big maybe, two out of ten would have a favorable opinion of AMD hardware so long as they've been paying attention for the last few years.  In terms of budget and expenditure, in 2025, Intel spent $17 billion in R&D versus AMD's $7.4 billion, outsizing it by a large amout. Total sales for 2025 are projected at approximately $53 billion for Intel and $33 billion for AMD.  I see this all the time and I've seen it for the past 8 years.... the only place that AMD has a ""lead"" is in the mind of PC hardware enthusiasts.... because it's not in the numbers as seen above (sales, expenditure, market share, etc), and it's not in the ""mindshare"" of your average consumer.  Hypothetically speaking, we could say that in a duopoly, as with Intel/AMD in x86, the BEST situation a consumer could hope for would be an even 50%/50% split in marketshare.... this would bring about the fiercest competition and would hopefully lower prices, increase innovation, etc. (and yet another reason why any fanboy who wants their favored company to dominate is LITERALLY cheering against their own interests as a consumer) Even with AMD's seriously impressive turnaround, their capture of marketshare, their ability to compete with two of the largest companies in the world while having considerably fewer resources, they still have a very, very, long way to go before approaching 50% of the x86 market across all segments.  In fact, to get any closer to that idealistic 50/50 split, AMD would have to continue winning and Intel losing for for many more years.  In other words, fears that AMD is ""becoming what Intel used to be"" and ""getting lazy"" are not an accurate reflection of the reality.",Neutral

Intel,"No, not really. Making up a ""winner"" is stupid and nothing but fanboy behavior.  A faster dGPU is generally better because you’re generally not power limited on a desktop. It doesn’t really matter whether or not you have a 5060 or 5090 or whatever.  In mobile systems it’s a huge difference.  There are entirely different power classes that don’t compete with each other. A thin and light notebook with a 15W CPU cannot have a 100W CPU in it.  Panther lake aims towards unplugged performance which is the 45W power class and the same as Strix Point.  Strix Halo is a much higher power class that requires a laptop to be plugged in permanently for the full performance.  It’s for mobile desktops that are usually plugged in but can be mobile for some time with heavily degraded performance.  It’s an entirely different class of product and you won’t find (many) devices where Strix Halo and Strix Point/Panther Lake compete with each other.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, i am gonna contend that either that is wrong, and is the 4xe version, or that intel basically lied on their benchmarks.  If none of those two things are true, Intel's new graphics architecture will absolutely dominate in the next round of discrete graphics GPUs.  with B580 intel needed \~80% more silicon to match nvidia performance. Now they need \~10-20% less die area. meaning their performance per transistor basically doubled gen/gen. which is unheard of. Even maxwell (largest architectural uplift in the history of GPUs in the last 10 years) did not achieve anything close to that. And it was a massive overhaul with huge changes.

The Pantherlake datasheet isn't public yet, but you can see plainly in the [actual spec sheet](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/memory-controller-mc/) for Arrowlake H that it supports 8 channels of LPDDR5X (additional [spec](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/supported-memory-modules-and-devices/) for channel width). Pantherlake will be the same.   The equivalent AMD doc is not available for Strix Halo but you can see the 16x16b spec quoted by Chips and Cheese [here](https://chipsandcheese.com/p/evaluating-the-infinity-cache-in#:~:text=Strix%20Halo%20has%2016%20memory%20controllers%20and%20CS%20instances%2C%20each%20handling%20a%2016%2Dbit%20LPDDR5X%20channel).  You cannot gang these channels into a dual channel mode, that is not how modern memory works, and there is no allowance in the LPDDR5 spec for 64b channels. The 16b channels have separate command/address buses and burst for a sufficient length (32n) to fill a cache line with each access.  To be clear I think standardising on 64b ""channels"" for marketing specifications is a good thing, it allows quick mental calculation of memory bandwidth without having to get into the nitty gritty. But if you're going to be pedantic and use the actual channel count, it's best to be correct.",Neutral

Their top SKU was 18c in Haswell, and that hasn't moved until like Cooper lake? So from 2014 until 2020, they haven't moved an inch in server space either.  Since we're talking about the server side now, Haswell-EP went from 18 cores maximum to 22 core Broadwell-EP to 28 cores on Skylake-SP. Cascade Lake-AP (rare bespoke sku) went up to 56 cores per socket. ""Haven't moved an inch"" is inaccurate.",Neutral

Panther Lake's cpu is built on the most advanced silicon process node 18A, designed to compete against TSMC's N2 (2nm) which is set to release in products in the second half of 2026. Panther Lake's gpu is built on TSMC N3E, a significantly more efficient N3. The 4050 is built on a custom 2020 TSMC 5nm variant, and Arrow Lake is built on TSMC N3+6nm. Arrow Lake is designed for specifically for high power use vs the low Lunar Lake and Panther Lake.   The future of integrated graphics is truly bright. I can see it being exactly where it is now.

Is there any truth to my hypothesis that Play Station PC ports are likely to be relatively well-optimized for AMD GPUs, given that the Play Station 5 itself is indeed some variant of RDNA? I recently got a 9070xt and have been overall very impressed, but its achilles heel seems to be ray tracing. This isn't exactly surprising to me, as I researched my GPU options to death before buying one, and the general consensus is that Nvidia is stronger in the ray tracing department. But if I were to boot up, say, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, a game that supports ray tracing at 60 fps on the base Play Station 5, could I expect it to perform better than a similarly demanding game that wasn't particularly optimized for AMD hardware?  It's largely hypothetical question, as I already own the GPU, am satisfied with the GPU, and of course did my due diligence before buying the GPU so I would know exactly what to expect. But I just haven't really heard much discussion of what, if any, overlap we get optimization-wise for games that were optimized first and foremost for the AMD-based Play Station 5.",Neutral

Now my RX 9070 XT is not detected at all in BIOS or Windows Device Manager, and I only get display output from the motherboard.  WHAT HAPPENED To see the old SATA SSD in the boot menu I had to enable CSM in the BIOS. Booting into that drive resulted in a black screen.

So I bought a 14900k and that wouldn't boot even with the latest bios. I had an Auros Z790 elite AX motherboard with 96gb Corsair vengeance 5200mhz DDR5 ram, and RTX 4090. So I said screw it, I'm gonna rebuild my PC and switch to AMD.   So I bought a MSI x870e Tomahawk Wifi Mobo, and Ryzen 9950x3d. I assembled everything, and it posts first try. Great. So I install Windows 11 and get to configuring things, removing bloat, etc, and I start having freezes. And my screens blinking off and a message telling me there was a failure and that it needs to put the graphics into safe mode.   On top of that, I was having a lot of random hiccups and lag. I checked with LatencyMon and was having all sorts of DPC latency with my Nvidia drivers. So I uninstall the drivers with DDU and install an older driver (566.36) and cool, things seem more stable. Except they're not. Now I'm getting high latency from other drivers like storage and network. So I'm thinking okay maybe it's the ram. So I run memtest86 overnight only to find my PC shut off at some point. I figured the ram must be faulty. So I took out one stick and tested it with the other and the test completed. I'm thinking okay, ram stability could explain a lot of things, so I've found the issue. So I stay with one stick and up the DRAM voltage to 1.35 to see how it goes.   I'm still getting intermittent latency. Some programs crashing, and on top of that, my PC won't shut down now. When I press shut down, my screens turn off and it seems like it's off, but my fans and light and everything else are still running. So I have to hold the power button to shut it down.   I am suspicious of my PSU because I think it could cause some of these issues, but I've had this PSU only since 2023 and it's a Corsair HX1000i.   The only things I kept from my old build were the PSU, GPU, and ram. And considering both systems were having issues, it makes sense that maybe one of them is acting up. But I don't really know if that explains all the problems I've been having.   I've updated the Bios, I've reinstalled windows, I've tweaked power plans and bios settings, reseated hardware, and I feel like I'm just on a wild goose chase.

Intel,"​Hi everyone, ​I'm having a frustrating issue with AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition. ​I have a Ryzen 7 7700X and a Sapphire MBA 7900 XTX. I've set my PBO limits and a thermal limit of 85°C in the BIOS (MSI motherboard). Everything works fine until I undervolt my GPU via Adrenalin. ​The moment I apply GPU settings, the software automatically toggles the CPU section to ""Custom/Overclock"" and locks the voltage around 1.3V - 1.35V. This completely ignores my BIOS PBO limits and thermal throttle settings. As a result, while my GPU stays cool, my CPU starts hitting 90°C+ in mostly every game, even though it should be capped. ​The worst part is: if I hit ""Reset to Default"" in Adrenalin to stop the CPU madness, it also resets my EXPO profile, dropping my RAM speed from 6000MHz to 4800MHz. ​Summary of the mess: ​GPU Undervolt active = CPU overheating (Software overrides BIOS PBO). ​Resetting Adrenalin = RAM speed drops to 4800MHz. ​MSI Center is not active/uninstalled. ​How can I force Adrenalin to STOP touching my CPU/RAM settings while keeping my GPU undervolt active? Is there a way to lock the CPU tuning part of the software? ​Any help is appreciated before I lose my mind.",Negative

Intel,"u/AMD_Vik Hey there! Just want to let you know that I've seen a lot of people have problems lately (including myself) with Direct-to-Display/Directmode implementations for DisplayPort/HDMI wired VR Headsets. DirectMode cannot enable reliably even on SteamVR native HMDs, and the only way to get them running right now is by installing a older driver version, enabling directmode there, and then updating to a newer version with the directmode already set -> so directmode itself still works fine, but there seem to be problems toggling into this. I also saw this happening with other VR compositors like PimaxPlay though radeon users are generally not as common there.  Happens with every driver released after and including 25.4.1 on my machine, and driver older than 25.3.1 can toggle into Directmode just fine. It is still broken as of 25.12.1 and 26.1.1  at first I thought this was a somewhat individual issue but as I've looked into it I saw more and more people have that problem with RDNA3 and RDNA4 GPUs across the board for basically any VR headset that uses Directmode.  I remember you mentioning on the AMD forums once that you want to be hit up about VR related issues - but really I didn't know how else I would reach out to you.",Negative

Intel,"u/AMD_Vik Hey Vik, I have a question/request that might seem a little strange and niche. Is there any way to have the Windows update AMD OEM drivers available for manual download? If this isn't your department, would it be possible for you to pass it on or redirect me to someone in that department?   I recently did a fresh Windows install, and during a Windows update, the AMD 32.0.21030.2001 driver was installed and worked incredibly well regarding audio and image quality (video & overall). Audio quality, specifically, is still the best I've heard from any AMD driver to date.  I thought maybe the fresh install itself might have been the reason for the better audio quality, so I installed an adrenaline driver that I'm very familiar with, and was disappointed because the audio was noticeably worse. I've now tried every driver besides 25.12.1 & 26.1.1, and the audio quality is substantially worse compared to 32.0.21030.2001.",Neutral

Intel,"Nope. Generally if the driver does not massively increases performance in some game, or you don't have any issues or the issue you have isn't fixed, then it's not worth updating, unless there is some new feature you want.    I reverted back to 25.9.1 (from the top of my head) because with any newer driver BF6 crashes randomly, and neither DICE nor AMD seem to give a damn about it.

Intel,"I think Linux developers are doing some experiments As of now, FSR 4 (FidelityFX Super Resolution 4) does not officially support RDNA 2 or RDNA 3 GPUs, even on Linux.

RDNA 3: Partial Support via Develer’s VKD3D-Proton  - Develer’s VKD3D-Proton 3.0 includes support for FP8 (8-bit floating point), which is required for FSR 4. - This means RDNA 3 GPUs (like RX 7600, 7900 XT/XTX) can run FSR 4 in some games via Proton, even though AMD doesn’t officially enable it. - Global override toggles in AMD’s 25.9.1 driver can bypass the FSR 4 whitelist, allowing it to run in FSR 3.1-compatible games.  I hope they succed it will be a slap in the face.",Neutral

Intel,"Your best case is your RX 7900 turning into Balsamico, whatever that means.",Positive

Now before I get kicked to death by angry people, there is a version of FSR Redstone that uses and INT8 path that is compatible and will work on 2 and 3, however that has not been launched today and AMD have not confirmed it will be.   That isn't to say they won't do it, but right now it's not been announced.

Here's the moment before it crashes to a black screen:  [afterburner screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/3YpJFtzM/Screenshot-2025-12-21-030537.png)  The dip in clocks is the moment it crashes. As you can see, it is running well above boost clocks. Hence, freezing in a few minutes, proceeded by a black screen, and a crash. The ups and downs are from me alt tabbing in the graphs, by  the way.   This is with core clock -200mhz applied in Afterburner and no crashes, boosts to just above declared boost clocks. Here the dips in up and down on power are probably me toying around how much exactly -mhz is needed.

Intel,"Most of the conversations happened across various discord servers, so I cannot directly link them, but I also found a few posts here on reddit that seem to point towards the same direction which roughly match with the timeframe.   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/1nl0540/direct\_mode\_not\_working/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/1nl0540/direct_mode_not_working/)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1ljezuf/steamvr\_crashing\_on\_amd\_drivers\_after\_2451\_direct/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1ljezuf/steamvr_crashing_on_amd_drivers_after_2451_direct/)  It's a bit odd because if you set the flag beforehand with a older version and then update to newer versions, Directmode still works fine, but if you fully remove the drivers with AMD's driver removal utility or Display Driver uninstaller (which propably deletes some cached driver file for directmode, is my guess), Directmode disables fully and can't turn on anymore at all.      As far as headsets are concerned, I know at least Valve's implementation seems to suffer from this (I know about cases involving the Valve Index, Bigscreen Beyond and Vive Pro 1, all using Valve's implementation), but somebody in the pimax subreddit community discord seemed to have the same problem, which he also was only able to fix by rolling back the drivers.  I could propably reach out to a few more affected people over discord and encourage them to get active here, if you'd like.

Intel,"Hi - I am having this problem. I wanted to try the special ROCM driver so dutifully did a clean install as suggested.  Tried to launch SteamVR and it errored. Realised headset had reverted to being a monitor, running at low resolution (less than recommended) Increased the resolution to recommended (combined resolution of the two panels), and SteamVR started detecting the headset - though promoted to enable direct mode. Pressing the button to enable it restarts SteamVR, but then prompts again, and HMD is still a monitor.   Interestingly reverting to the RDNA 4 release driver, it instantly worked - Direct Mode was enabled without me having to toggle.  So it is like SteamVR is successfully toggling something, but the newer AMD drivers ignore whatever it is doing/don't act on it. As soon as older driver is installed, it does act on it, and the HMD disappears from Display Settings/stops being treated as a monitor.  This wouldn't affect the majority of SteamVR users who are streaming to a Quest, and it wouldn't impact people who upgrade to a newer driver without a cleanup.  It would affect people doing fresh installs with a recent driver, and people who do clean driver installs/use DDU.",Neutral

Intel,issue persists in the newest 26.1.1 update....,Neutral
Intel,OK thanks.,Positive
Intel,"First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to listen/read and look into this, I appreciate it greatly. I'm not sure why, but it seems your reply about the issue possibly being related to ISR isn't showing up on here for some reason. Could just be the site being dumb.  So, the audio differences I'm hearing aren't related to functionality, or the ability to playback audio without interrupts (dropouts, clicking, popping, choppiness). That has been flawless, for me, which is great. I'm referring to audio fidelity differences between drivers.  For instance, I uninstalled the driver I've recently been testing (25.12.1) via DDU and listened to some music with just the Microsoft display adapter being used as the driver. The audio sounded pretty normal again, and what I would consider correct/good. I then ran windows update, and it thankfully installed the 32.0.21030.2001 driver. Listened to some music, and as I heard before, it's still the best sounding driver I've used. The only other driver I've used that comes close is 25.1.1. That one has some slight issues with audio fidelity and image quality, but it was close enough to correct at the time.   The only thing I can think of that sounds similar and would describe what I'm hearing with these newer drivers is when you have a bit-depth and sampling rate mismatch between your music and output device. I have my audio devices set to 16/44.1 in windows, but with these newer drivers (25.9.1-25.12.1), the audio sounds as if the bit depth and sampling rate are set to higher values, even though they aren't. It's extremely strange, and sort of difficult to explain, but that's what I'm hearing.   The frustrating and unfortunate reality that might be coming into play here, is that differences could also vary between systems. So, a bad sounding driver on my system (25.9.1), might possibly sound fine or even good on a different system with different components.  It could also be caused by or related to interactions between code or the registry entries of different programs on the system interacting with drivers, but that's above my level of understanding. I'm just a dude who is noticing stuff (audio & video) and would like others who are smarter and more skilled to look into why there are differences in the first place and what could potentially be causing them.    By the way, you guys have been doing a great job with the video/image quality of these recent drivers. They are substantially better and closer to reference than everything previously released. 25.9.1 and 25.11.1 are the best drivers I've tested/used, in regards to video & image quality.",Neutral

If you have the time, I'd like to see if LatencyMon (the util recommended by my colleague) can highlight any differences between a good and bad driver on your system? I'm wondering if WU builds lack a specific SW component leading to issues (maybe something like the ANS service).",Neutral
Intel,"there won't be an ""fsr 5"" because any game with fsr implemented from here on out should, in theory, be compatible with every future version of fsr made, so numbering them isn't as meaningful. they're probably just going to stick with unofficial codenames like redstone for diffrentiation.

Intel,7900 xt!  I did a DDU and installed the newest driver too so I feel like it isn't carried over unless it was something from my settings ...,Neutral
Intel,"Ah gotcha. To be fair, I would say the differences between these more recent drivers are much smaller now compared to the drivers released in 2023, 2024, and 2025. Especially trying each driver from 25.9.1 to 25.12.1, specifically the audio, seems to get better with each release. It seems the team, or someone, also heard what I did with the 25.9.1 driver and tried to fix/improve it with each subsequent driver release.   I haven't tried 26.1.1 yet, but I will to test and compare. I'll also install LatencyMon to see if there is a correlation between good/bad audio and latency.  It really seems like the team that handles the display/video side of the drivers has mostly corrected the issues that were present with the old drivers (video output format/range, luminance levels, gamma curve, sharpness, white point, grayscale & color accuracy). There are still differences, but I wouldn't get too worried about it.  The oddball out of the bunch is 25.8.1. The audio is actually pretty good, but different. Sounds as if there is a surround sound effect turned on, or the audio output format is surround sound instead of stereo. It works really well for gaming, but music sounds a little strange. Due to the overall frequency response balance, it's honestly not bad. If it wasn't for the video/image quality side of things, I would probably use that driver.   On the video side, I think there is something wrong with the gamma curve and color. The gamma curve tracks higher (darker) in the lower luminance range. The white point and grayscale are more blue than neutral gray, and the overall color saturation is reduced, as if the color gamut clamp in the adrenaline software is being used. I checked to see if this was the case with my colorimeter, but the color gamut is normal for my monitor, so the actual color volume isn't being reduced. Very strange, but interesting.",Positive

Intel,"There will already be branching inside the code of the driver. This has been the case already, to various degrees, for years. It's not new.  It's just whether AMD wants to formally spread those branches out on a file / compilation level and distribute different packages. And then publicly whether they commit to updating all branches of code or only some.  For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch. Of course, we have very little outside insight into the exact spread of these cases that AMD wants to pay their engineers to work on.",Neutral

It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.   While digging into my issue, I wanted to see if DP2.0 / uhbe20  compatible display would have these issues, but my current display only has HDMI2.1 and dp1.4.  Hopefully someone else had experience with them on 4k 240hz.",Negative

Intel,"I kinda fixed it by turn off XMP/EXPO running the ram the lowest bus, still crash to but 1 crash every 2-3 hrs still better than 15 minutes.",Neutral
Intel,Why does it seem like driver quality/support has gotten substantially worse this past decade? Are we running out of skilled software engineers or is hardware just getting too out of hand?,Negative
Intel,there are multiple reports of lower gpu usage with 25.9 and above.. after going back to 25.8 I have 15%+ fps  I guess the constant crashing with rdna1 cards is also not related to these drivers,Negative

Intel,"Appreciate you reaching out with this - that's an interesting data point to consider.  In this case, the quirky behaviour with HDMI 2.1 + FRL was attributed to a change made in the display stack, I don't think it explicitly involves display stream compression to repro, just high enough display bandwidth (though I could be mistaken)",Positive
Intel,"Interesting. I've been experiencing random BSODs on my PC too on a fresh Win11 install too, I was also suspecting it was something to do with auto HDR toggle but I didn't know for sure.  I'm running 180hz 1440 LG panel but I don't recall if it's using hdmi or DP.

Intel,Thank you! Exciting keen to see what it’s like,Positive
Intel,"It has nothing to do with the lack of vulkan support, even when fsr4 comes to vulkan, the game still needs ray regeneration implementation from the devs, you cant use optiscaler through dlss inputs, like you probably will be able to in fx alan wake 2",Negative
Intel,I suppose is going to be fixed as soon as Amd Redstone go out. Basically is going to add every tecnology that Path tracing needs to work. Off course the devs would have to implement them in the game too,Neutral
Intel,"The issue is if you try to use path tracing. Which to be fair, you probably shouldn't unless the miracle of them getting Virtuous to implement Ray Regeneration in Cyberpunk happens.",Negative
Intel,yes i tried it ... maybe it is because of the 7800X3D ... i really dont know... i will wait for the next patch ... should come tomorrow 18.11. ... but i have read so many threads and i am not the only one...,Neutral
Intel,Hmm fair. For me on 9070XT if I had raytracing enabled it would crash most regularly on loading back to the menu after extraction which was annoying but at least not game destroying lol. But yeah annoying enough that I turned RT off entirely.   I hope this means I can turn it back on because the game runs well enough for it.,Negative
Intel,"Yes. So far, so good. I'm not 100% sure what fixed it.      I uninstalled both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master standalone applications. Deleted the ""amdryzenmasterv"" keys. Rebooted.  Then I installed Adrenalin and used the Ryzen Master installer in Adrenalin (Performance > Metrics > Install Ryzen Master).  I think this problem might have something to do with a handshake breaking between Ryzen Master and Adrenalin, after upgrading just Adrenalin.   From now on, I'll probably do clean installs, removing and reinstalling both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master, through Adrenalin Performance tab.",Positive
Intel,"My last two processors are ryzen amd, my last three video cards are amd radeon and next one will be amd also, nvidia has driver issues as well, to be honest.  But yes, some issues are too annoying and updating drivers is lottery at this point. I would advice against updating drivers unless you need it for specific new game or have the latest video cards - rx 9070 \[xt\]  or 9060 xt .

Intel,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.  More people use HDMI than what people think and those TVs don’t always have a DP connector at all.,Negative

Intel,"what about whatever changed post 25.3.1 for multi monitors? Any driver 25.3.1 and older i can run my main at 200hz, my side at 165, and my third at 60 without issue. Any driver newer than 25.3.1 and running my main at 200hz then playing a game will cause the second monitor (165hz) to flicker, glitch, and freak out the entire time, until the game on the main monitor is closed. Dropping to 165 on the main monitor down from 200hz \*fixes\* the issue but, i paid for 200hz and would like to be able to actually use it again.  (7700xt system)",Neutral
Intel,Hell yeah 🙂 amd I appreciate you see the issues Iv been a fan boy for a long time and I know it will be fixed,Positive
Intel,"Hi. Sorry, I thought this was pretty common as I've had this issue with two different systems and 3 AMD GPUs across 2 generations. [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1jayump/chrome_full_screen_freezes_after_switching_to_amd/) [Or here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/3890720/parts-of-screen-freezes-when-using-chrome) Chrome (or other Chromium browsers, I've had this happen with Edge too) in fullscreen, with graphics acceleration enabled.   Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind this only actually matters if one protocol or the other is **actually** limiting bandwidth for the [resolution * FPS] you want to display on your monitor  For instance, DP 1.4 can do ~25Gbits/s, which translates to roughly 1440p @ 240fps, or 4k @ 120fps  If you have proper cable into HDMI 2.1, it should be able to do ~42Gbits/s, which would instead be 4k @ 190fps  Read up the wikipedia tables for bandwidth specs and resolution / fps / bit depth rates for more",Neutral
Intel,Yeah most people are still have dp 1.4 monitors though. No way I'm swapping my monitor just for dp 2.1 as it's just too awesome. Although these tandem OLED screens look interesting... Hmm lol,Positive
Intel,"lol, listened too much to linus  https://youtu.be/g3FkuZNSGkw?t=261",Neutral
Intel,That was my very first actual driver issue I experienced with AMD.,Negative
Intel,Oh that's nice! I'll look into it when I get the chance.,Positive
Intel,Cool. Thank you,Positive
Intel,I might turn on ray tracing in like a medium or low setting just for shits and giggles or screenshots but I don't plan on playing with it on all the time since I'll also play at 1440p so I don't wanna have a really bad experience 😖,Negative
Intel,Exactly! It's insane. I can't believe running through a translation layer is more stable than running native,Neutral
Intel,"but i dont know something is also wrong with 25.11.1 ... AMD Adrenalin randomly vanishes from tray     i dont want to roll back to 25.9.1 :-(    but this version was the last which was good so far      maybe when we have luck amd is able to provide next time a ""perfect"" driver without any issues?",Negative
Intel,"Could be it, nothing hardware wise at all and just software too.     Yeah, you're not the 1st I've read that says they have issues on the game.     If you're crashing and the system reboots it does make me think of some stability issues and not really just GPU, but I'm guessing you've already tried stability tests and using the system without OC+A-XMP/EXPO disabled.     Once upon a time I remember reading some people, on other instances and other games, having crashes like that (complete reboot) due to PSU instability as well.     Good luck!",Neutral
Intel,That's strange. My game defaulted to everything maxed out including running ray tracing and I haven't noticed any issues. The game runs incredibly well.  I've got a 5800X3D & 9070XT as well.,Positive
Intel,"Fair enough, and yeah sooner the better for all of us",Positive
Intel,It absolutely could be.  Europe has some pretty good consumer law and promising features that could impact your purchase decision are part of this law.  It can fall under misleading advertisement,Neutral
Intel,"It's not freezing, it's just that the GPU usage is practically at 100% all the time, even with V-Sync enabled. With the 25.9 drivers, this doesn't happen, and the clock speed varies normally, increasing and decreasing as needed when V-Sync is enabled. These 25.10 drivers are causing the GPU to consume more energy unnecessarily.",Neutral
Intel,Fingers crossed,Neutral
Intel,"Thanks for attempting to retest.  It's a 7900XTX with an Index connected via DisplayPort. I am on the latest 25.11.1 driver.  I run a monitor at 4k 120Hz 10bpc with HDR Off, which uses DSC, as my main and only display. I tried disabling DSC in the monitor settings which runs at 4k 120Hz 8bpc with HDR Off but I don't think I noticed a change in latency. I thought that DSC on and off on two different devices might contribute to the problem but I'm not sure.   I have also tried running the Index under a RX480 on another PC and I fairly certain the latency looks different under 90Hz and looks similar under 120Hz. Can't play much to test though as an RX480 runs the Index at a very blurry setting. Getting around to doing this test is what took me so long to reply.",Neutral
Intel,Were you able to find the issue?,Neutral
Intel,"Allright ty, will Install new, any differences in performance?",Neutral
Intel,"im running 25.11.1 on win10 7900xt. no problems besides afmf2 breaking the performance overlay, which ive had for multiple updates now",Neutral
Intel,I don't think you understand what I mean.. If you downgrade to that you can get fsr 4 to work on 6000 series without having to change any files.,Neutral
Intel,Thank you for this. This was very helpful. Got adrenaline working fine now.,Positive
Intel,"I wish my LG C4 42"" had a display port. Its my primary monitor.",Positive
Intel,"Yep, AMD is not so quick in fixing their driver download page, I still can remember when X870E chipset came out but you found only X670 option. The drivers were the same, but man it’s your flagship chipset! Anyway, drivers install but Adrenalin App does not work for me… and have zero time to reinstall Windows.",Negative
Intel,"Don't do that, i'm suffering with both 7900XTX + RVII (and even with RX6400)",Negative
Intel,"I feel like AMD can do a bit of a better job communicating this, despite Vik's great efforts in this subreddit. Just saying: hey guys, we know about this, it sucks, bear with us please can make things better in the long run in my opinion.",Neutral
Intel,"We've not observed anything like this internally, and I've personally not seen this at all in the field. This one may be specific to your display combination. I'll talk to a colleague in our display team about what we can do to learn more about that behaviour on your side - we might ask you to capture a special kind of log file during a state when your secondary display is blanking with gameplay on the primary",Neutral
Intel,Can you tell us what content you have on the secondary panel when it starts misbehaving? Is this behaviour affected if you disable VRR on it too?,Neutral
Intel,"I see. I recall the partial display freeze being related to DWM & multi plane overlay in Windows. One of our community testers encountered this and remedied with the overlayminFPS DWORD here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/1kgp7ar/cause_and_solution_to_windows_24h2_related/?sort=new  If you're getting TDRs, with chome(ium) + gameplay, pass us over a kernel memory dmp and we'll take a look into it",Neutral
Intel,"Oh yeah I noticed that too when watching it, kinda funny of him to say it as it's on screen",Positive
Intel,I've had a really stable 60 fps experience even with path tracing (minus the crashes) but I'm on a 9070 with fsr 4 on quality,Positive
Intel,Can't comment on the vanishing of the tray since I have mine configured to hide it from tray always.,Neutral
Intel,also i have coil whine since this driver 25.11.1. ?!  also in idle sometimes...  very strange driver...,Negative
Intel,Every roadmap since forever has a small print disclaimer at the bottom at the page saying that release times are subject to change.,Neutral
Intel,"I upgraded from 25.9 because it started crashing, it was not crashing until yesterday, also I have limited gpu usage, clockspeed it is working sometimes, sometimes not.",Neutral
Intel,We've still not been able to reproduce this unfortunately. I'll need to check in when I'm back at work next year,Negative
Intel,Didn't really paid attention to it :( but at least my game doesn't crash anymore!!,Negative
Intel,"did you download the same filename with the one i mentioned? i tried downloading windows 11 link and it also gave me the same filename, lol",Neutral
Intel,No you can't.,Neutral
Intel,"I don' think you understand either, 25.9.1 is that driver, 23.9.1 was released in 2023 before FSR 4 was even a thing.",Negative
Intel,"Glad I could help, the crashes on Arc Raiders were pissing me off big style so I wanted to share what helped me.",Positive
Intel,"They are TV's, not pc monitors. Buy the right tool for the job",Neutral
Intel,"I couldn't find the DWM key so I made one, we'll see if that fixes it. Thank you for replying. But please, forward it to someone. There must be people out there on AMD hardware that are not tech savvy and this just breeds bad reputation.",Neutral
Intel,"Nope, that didn't fix it. Chrome continues to forget to update its display. And WoW continues to crash in the background leading to massive stutters when panning the camera around quickly, along with plenty of other odd behaviours.",Negative
Intel,"Yeah, I'm facing the same issue on RX 9060 XT   Is it a GPU driver issue, or a Windows issue that Microsoft needs to fix?",Negative
Intel,since last BF6 Update i had zero crashes also on 25.11.1,Negative
Intel,"That's not how it works. Small print won't save you from stuff like this, you think that they can stop releasing this software for 2-3 years because some small print said 'Subject to change'?   European consumer law would absolutely support the consumer in this case. If you promise a feature by a certain date, you will need to deliver it. If the development takes way too long, you are in for a ride",Negative
Intel,What about 25.11.1?,Neutral
Intel,Happy New Year ;)  Were you able to check on this issue yet?,Positive
Intel,Yeah same for me. Considering how similair win10 and 11 are under the hood i just went with it. Still absolutely no problems sofar.,Positive
Intel,Can't what? I have been using fsr 4 on my 6700xt for a month now using this tutorial   https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1nmyhpo/fsr_4_on_rdna_2_guide/?share_id=EEC5RH2XmDUZa2DjeRO-5&utm_content=2&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1,Neutral
Intel,"> 23.9.1   Come on man, it's clearly a typo and you know it. That's why he's confused.",Negative
Intel,"Look online for fsr 4 on 6000 and 5000 series, you will understand,    Edit :I will just link you a tutorial to understand...      https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1nmyhpo/fsr_4_on_rdna_2_guide/?share_id=EEC5RH2XmDUZa2DjeRO-5&utm_content=2&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1",Neutral
Intel,Did you reboot after setting that key? Is the display with chrome still only partially updating?,Neutral
Intel,"Haha. Sure thing buddy. If that would be the case, that a small print on a roadmap can't save a company, we would have hundreds of lawsuits in EU. You must be new to the hardware scene.",Negative
Intel,we've done so several times but have not reproduced the issue so far. I'll follow up with the T&D team about this ticket when I'm back at work next week,Neutral
Intel,thank you,Positive
Intel,"Uh huh, yeah I did it too. You still have the overwrite DLLs. Hence the flipping tutorial. Completely irrelevant to this topic, anyways.",Negative
Intel,"Not a typo, I was asking about something else and he missed my point...",Negative
Intel,"Yes, it can't.   They could add that they can sell your organs, doesn't make it legal though.   Also lawsuits usually don't happen because of a feature or if they happen, in a very small amount that isn't meaningful. Class action also doesn't exist in Europe, so obviously you won't hear about it like in the USA.",Negative
Intel,"But flipping the dlls could get you banned from online games , that's why i was wondering if it's finally fixed in this update and we wouldn't have to flip the dlls anymore..",Negative
Intel,"You literally claimed we could do this without overwriting any files, that was obviously false.  Anyway, no. I would not expect AMD to bring FSR4 to RDNA3 anytime soon, if at all.",Negative

Intel,Can you use cuda and rocm together? Or do you have to use Vulcan for compute related tasks?,Neutral
Intel,"This gave me an idea for getting a faster local AI at home. Mine is eating all my 24GB vram, and its not super fast cause of the lack of tensor cores in any of my hardware.  But if i could just stack enough VRAM... I have an old mining rig with 1070s collecting dust.   Hmmmm :P",Negative

Intel,Placona! I've been happy with a 6700xt for years.,Positive
Intel,absolute cinema,Neutral
Intel,"That is not ""SLI"".  That is Crossfire.  There is a major difference.  ""SLI"" only permits alternating frame rendering (AFR).  Crossfire permits splitting a single frame load among different cards in addition to AFR.",Neutral
Intel,"Brawndo has electrolytes, that's what plants crave!",Neutral
Intel,"Works in Windows too. But Windows has way too much overhead for all of the AI garbage, ads and integrated spyware running in the background to still be a usable operating system. Linux is much better.   The drivers install all side-by-side, and all GPUs show up as OpenCL devices. In the software you can then select which one to run on.   FluidX3D can select multiple OpenCL devices at once, each holding only one part of the simulation box in its VRAM. So VRAM of the GPUs is pooled together, with communication happening over PCIe.",Neutral
Intel,"Windows has a section where you can select a gpu to run certain applications. It was introduced in win 10, but i only know the location in win 11    I think you can get to it through settings -> display -> graphics",Neutral
Intel,"What kind of application are you trying to run on specific GPUs? IIRC Vulkan will let you specify what device to use, even if it's not the GPU whose monitor is showing the application. DirectX I think is controlled by the Graphics settings in Control Panel. I think there's a page somewhere that lets you pick the GPU. That might be a Windows 11 thing though. OpenGL is the one that AFAIK will only render via the device whose monitor is displaying the application.",Neutral

Intel,"_snap_ and half of CUDA software is dead, as people prefer the universally compatible and equally fast [OpenCL](https://github.com/ProjectPhysX/OpenCL-Wrapper)",Neutral
Intel,"- The 7700 XT is quite slow, AMD has bad memory controllers, a legacy moved forward from GCN architecture. And the oversized 3-slot cooler doesn't make it any faster either - 2828 MLUPs/s peak - Arc B580 - 4979 MLUPs/s - The 8 year old Titan Xp (Pascal) - 5495 MLUPs/s - Arc Alchemist (A770 16GB) is similar memory performance, with wider 256-bit memory bus but slower memory clocks - 4568 MLUPs/s   Full FluidX3D performance comparison chart is here: https://github.com/ProjectPhysX/FluidX3D?tab=readme-ov-file#single-gpucpu-benchmarks   But performance is not my main focus here. I'm happy to have all major GPU vendor's hardware available for OpenCL development and testing. Quite often there is very specific issues with code running in one particular driver - compilers optimize differently, and sometimes there is even driver bugs that need workarounds. Extensive testing is key to ensure the software works everywhere out-of-the-box.",Negative
Intel,"Had that since 2018 - got it for free through Nvidia academic hardware grant program. It has slower memory clocks, but double (384-bit) memory bus. It's actually the strongest of the three GPUs.",Positive

Intel,"They work well together - all GPUs show up as OpenCL devices. Need specifically Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTE though, as all drivers need specific ranges of Linux kernel versions and kernel 6.11 happens to work with them all.",Neutral
Intel,"Technically FluidX3D uses neither SLI nor Crossfire, but cross-vendor multi-GPU instead, for domain decomposition of a Cartesian grid simulation box, to hold larger fluid simulations in the pooled VRAM.   The rendering is done multi-GPU too, as domain decomposition rendering. Each GPU knows only a part of the whole fluid simulation box in VRAM and can't see the others. It only renders its own domain, at 3D offset, to its own frame with accompanying z-buffer, and copies those to CPU over PCIe. The CPU then overlays the frames.",Neutral
Intel,I find it sad we killed SLI and Crossfire especially now that we have Resizable Bar and higher speed PCIE connections. (I’m no expert but I know we have made advancements that would improve the experience of multi-GPU setups.),Negative

Intel,That's awesome!,Neutral
Intel,"Yes, but SLI is a bad description for it.",Negative
Intel,"The faster PCIe 4.0/5.0 and future iterations mean that dedicated SLI/Crossfire bridges are obsolete. The PCIe bandwidth nowadays is more than enough. And PCIe is the generic industry standard interface, easier to program for than proprietary hardware that's different for every vendor.   For games multi-GPU is gone for good (too few users, too large cost of development, no return of investment for game Studios). But in simulation/HPC/AI software multi-GPU is very common as it allows to go beyond the VRAM capacity of a single large GPU for cheaper.",Neutral
Intel,"sli/crossfire were killed for good reason, its just a bad time all around if half of your gpu's core/cache is located a foot away from the other half, unless your baseline performance is so damn low that the microstutters just get lost in the noise.  ultimately chiplet cpu/gpu designs are basically just an evolved form of sli/crossfire, and we're happily starting to get quite good at those.  (assuming we're talking about games)",Negative
Intel,"indeed it did, if only game devs adopted this more. Then again, the idea of two high end GPUs like we have today in a single PC is kinda horrifying.",Negative
Intel,"There is not really a clear limit. More PCIe bandwidth makes scaling efficiency better, less means the software will run a bit slower in multi-GPU mode. 3.0 x4 (~3.3GB/s) is just enough for reasonable efficiency.",Neutral

PC will perform the best if OS is located on the closest one.   Much better off just slapping two GPUs together in a single form factor than two separate GPUs.  Guess that is why we have 5090 these days. At about double the price of the old flagships.    You can view that as SLI i guess :P",Neutral
Intel,"Iirc Rise and Shadow of the Tomb Raider were the only games to support the used of mixed multi GPU (at least mainstream) other than ashes.

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative
Intel,One thing I appreciate about AMD is having the lowest CPU overhead for their graphics drivers. Makes a difference if you're CPU limited in a game.,Positive
Intel,So Nvidia now has the lowest driver overhead? Seems like they took the HUB video seriously,Neutral
Intel,So the money you save on a GPU you will need to spend on a better CPU??  Might as well get a faster GPU.,Negative
Intel,Interesting that B580 doesn't look bad at all with a 13600k. I wonder what it's like with a 13400 or 12600k. It seems like just having those extra threads provided by the e-cores takes care of the overhead it needs.,Positive
Intel,"Unless you're running a CPU that's *many* many years old, GPU overhead is not really something you need to worry about. Whether AMD has less overhead or Nvidia has less, it really doesn't matter.",Neutral

Intel,Battlemage drivers use the cpu for software accelerating certain processes that are not being hardware accelerated in the GPU.,Neutral
Intel,Glad you brought up Nvidia as I didn’t know this had improved until the testing around Arc showed it had gone.,Positive
Intel,"According to the graphs, AMD has slightly less overhead than NVIDIA.",Neutral
Intel,"No, they do not.  The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software.  They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  The main example that seems to suggest otherwise is actually a demonstration of nVidia's forced threading of DX11 games, which can increase performance despite the increased overhead it entails, when the CPU has enough headroom overall (i.e. it doesn't eat into the single-thread performance).",Negative
Intel,"Lowest with DX11 and older, but not with the newer APIs",Neutral
Intel,And when is the last time HUB did a dedicated video showing the improvement in overhead?,Neutral
Intel,or it's just a cache/memory access issue,Neutral

Intel,"> Unless you're running a CPU that's many many years old, GPU overhead is not really something you need to worry about.   That's just not true with Battlemage.  CPUs released in 2024 showed the issue in testing.    It's not year of release, it's capabilities.",Negative

Intel,"Hmm, Nvidia lost less performance going from 14900k to 13600k than AMD but more when going down to 12100",Neutral
Intel,"> No, they do not. The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software. They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  This was true for Alchemist but not for Battlemage.",Negative
Intel,That's not true. Intel's issue is being too verbose in commands/calls.,Negative

Intel,"Is it my expectations being too high or this ain't a huge uplift? To go back to the classic: hopefully Zen 6 with RDNA 4 will offer a bigger uplift. We only have to wait a year and a half...  Anyway, question for the more knowledgeable people: how could the 890M perform with a 50W chip variant, but with 5600 SO-DIMM RAM? What to expect?",Neutral
Intel,"I find it sad that most review outlet is not testing CCX latency for these new CPUs.  These Zen 5 + Zen 5c have insanely high cross CCX latency, 180ms tested by geekerwan to be exact. For reference the 5950x had a 70ms latency for their cross ccd latency and the 4 ccd 1950x had a 150ms cross ccd latency with the closet 2 ccd and 200ms between the furthest 2.

Intel,"If this is true, Strix Point is going to claim total dominance over the GTX 1650 market. Won't be until 2023 when the theoretical RTX 4050 is released to surpass Strix Point's efficiency. Then super budget-friendly Strix Halo will come next year and take the RTX 2080's lunch money. Game over Nvidia.",Neutral
Intel,"Strix Halo is rumored to be a whopping 40 CUs of RDNA3.5 so...   That'll do it no sweat, if they release it.",Positive
Intel,almost there,Neutral
Intel,"We're a ways off from that still. These Strix Point 890M results are comparable to 1/2 the performance of the RX 6600. That's only good enough for \~30 FPS in Assassins Creed Mirage at 1080p Max.  I think this will be great for non-gaming purposes, like Adobe, Autodesk and so on. 890M should be a photo editing powerhouse.",Positive
Intel,"I mean current consoles are already APU power houses, they can give you 120fps depending on the game, and 30-60fps depending on what mode you select. And these consoles are pretty power constrained and pared down compared to PCs. So this APU here could easily double the performance of a console.   That's tapping on 4070/7800 levels of performance.",Positive
Intel,Never gonna happen as long as they use DDR memory.  The only powerful APUs are those that use GDDR or HBM. See: every AMD-powered console and the MI300A.,Negative
Intel,"Radeon iGPUs are mostly limited by the shared RAM bandwidth. I was thinking of getting an 8700G a little while ago, and the benchmarks varied wildly depending on RAM frequency and overclocks.  Maybe they'll improve it by hooking it up to a wider GDDR bus in laptops, similar to how the current PS5 and Xboxes work (IIRC?)",Neutral
Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks. Intel is already moving on it and I think the main thing holding AMD back is that they rely on 3rd parties for memory packaging so the capacity goes to the more lucrative enterprise chips first.",Neutral
Intel,"The iGPU uplift is extremely underwhelming, I guess this is why Asus did the ROG Ally X model instead of waiting for these chips. I wouldnt be surprised if Lunar Lake with Xe2 passes Zen 5's iGPU at lower power levels, at higher ones im sure RNDA 3.5 will be ahead.",Negative

Intel,"It'll need to be a custom tooled APU like Aerith/Van Gogh if it is to take full advantage of the 890m.     Nearly all of the configs that release of 16cu Point APU or 40cu Halo will be an APU slapped in a chassis without an adequate power or memory bandwidth setup for the igpu.     What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra. Its desktop tower chip is behind the entry level mobile OS chip from its competitor. It is a decade behind the desktop chips of its competitor, itis hardly Monster class.",Neutral

And AMD ""can make"" such APUs -> PS5 Pro (as a more cost effective solution). AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative
Intel,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",Negative

If Intel can be competitive in the budget market it will at least put a fire under amd to lower their prices/make a better valued product.",Negative
Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't.

Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral
Intel,"This was a graphics card, not a ‘GPU’ in terms that we understand them now, just to bolster the point about how much of a disparity this comparison reveals.",Neutral
Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so?

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.

Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.

This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.

In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.

It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?

Intel,">There are still people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.  That being said, this is typical AMD BS that you have to deal with as an owner of their GPUs.

Intel,"Excellent post, very informative. Would take issue with this though:       ""Speaking of VRAM, The drivers use VRAM less efficiently. Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with?    My own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures.",Neutral

Intel,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

Intel,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Intel,"I get that you are being cheeky, but the use-case is very difference and the professional-demands are far far far higher.  When you run several machines off of a single unit, suddenly there's workloads that has to be completely in due time for things to move ahead.  I just want to contextualize the issue you are making (a tadd) fun of.  So in the basic but common example above, you can't really complete your job because the entire main system has to be shut down. That's like stranding 6 people because the bus broke down. And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.  I think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable. There need to be a proper high-grade (and low grade) reliable way to avoid that.  Just sucks it took this long, and so much effort to get AMD to pay notice to the issue at hand here.

In Linux - *in some cases, but it very common* - you get more VRAM usage on Nvidia compare to AMD because this how Vulkan driver implemented in Nvidia and overhead of DXVK.  P.S. For context - Unity VRAM usage is - Unity allocating ""how much it want"" and in case of two different GPU Unity may allocate less or more in DX-API, or DX-API have some internal behavior for Unity case on Nvidia so it allocating less.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

My gaming stability issues were always caused by unstable RAM timings and CPU OC settings - since I upgraded to an AM5 platform with everything stock, I'm solid as a rock. My 7900XTX has been absolutely perfect.  There is an unfair perception in gaming with AMD's drivers where people think they are far worse than they really are - it's a circlejerk at this point.  Your issue is different (and valid), you don't need to conflate the known issues in professional use cases with gaming - it'll just get you pushback because people who use AMD cards for gaming (like me) know the drivers are fine for gaming, which makes you come across as being hyperbolic - and if you're being hyperbolic about the gaming stuff, what else are you being hyperbolic about? Even if you aren't, it calls into question your credibility on the main subject of your complaint.",Negative

Intel,"> You state you never had issues, however, how many times have you had a game randomly crash with no error/fault or some random error that is cryptic? How often have you assumed this is the game's fault?  My aging 5700 XT crashes in games far less often than my friends who are on various Nvidia cards from 2080 Ti to 4090.  Same for when I was on Polarix with RX 470s.  Game crashes are rarely the fault of the graphics driver (or hardware), regardless of brand.  This isn't a good point to be making, because it's just wrong.  > suffered from a silicon bug in it's PSP crippling some of it's core functionality  This again?  No, Radeon VII and other Vega products were killed off because they were very expensive to produce and they weren't moving enough units at any price to justify any further investment or even any meaningful support.  Everyone paying attention called this when they revealed Vega, and even long before with the tragic marketing.  Insert the GIF of Raja partying at the AMD event, complete with cigar.  People love coming up with theories as to what critical flaw or failure point caused a given generation of AMD GPUs to suck, and how those will be fixed in the next generation.  From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.  Does AMD need to improve things?  Of course.  But to act like there's 1 critical flaw, or that something is fundamentally broken and making the cards unusable for a given purpose, or to cite George Hotz as an authority is just way off target.",Negative
Intel,"Part of it is rooting for the underdog, part of it is probably due to people legitimately not having problems.

Intel,"Good ol' ""it works on my machine"".  It's a small and niche userbase so it gets downplayed, backed by ""it works on my machine"" when you express your concerns, despite the fact they don't use that feature or have zero knowledge on the topic. Same goes to H.264 hardware encoder being worst of the bunch for years.  And the average joe just doesn't use Linux, if they do, then few of of them actually toy around virtualization, then even fewer of them poke around hypervisors with device passthrough(instead of using emulated devices, which has poor performance and compatibility). It really is the most niche of the niche circle. I'm not looking down on users or playing gatekeeping/elitism but that's just a hard pill to swallow.  But that doesn't mean AMD should be ghosting the issues as people have been expressing their concerns even on datacenter systems where real money flows.  How many r/Ayymd trolls actually know VDI, VFIO and let alone what ""reset"" means? Probably has never google'd them, despite the fact one of the most well-respected FOSS wizards in this scene is trying to communicate with them.

Intel,"Firstly, i am barely even able to find any posts about this issue. Which means that issue is extremely case specific, so you should not categorically blame AMD and Adrenaline. With how many people this happen with, it is not problem of Adrenalin itself (otherwise it would've been reported A LOT more than i can find).   They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.     From global issues with CPU OC was only one i mentioned. When AMD integrated Ryzen Master, old GPU OC presets did reset CPU OC values to default.

Temporal upscaling is no different. DLAA and FSRAA actually are better than native, since they replace terrible TAA implementations and render at native.  However, this better than native upscaling narrative seems more like a belief (or a marketing push/tactic) than reality.   - If action is high enough, it probably won't matter much, but in single-player games where I like to look around, I just can't deal with the resolution loss.

Compared to a B60, the 3090 is readily available for $1100, and provides the same VRAM, double the compute and memory bandwidth, better perf/watt, and CUDA support.  With the dual GPU cards even at $2k each this does have one single niche - being able to get 144 GB of VRAM in a server at under 1500W for under $10k -  which is legitimately useful for LLM inference.

For refference HDMI 1.4 has 10.2Gbit/s  So as i understood it most of the data bandwidth were used for tossing the image output back and forth as only a single card were the one outputting the image (assuming you weren't running tripple monitor widescreen setup on SLI GPU's....) and our image data could more or less saturate the link  someone correct my math if i'm totally bonkers, but 2560x1440p = 3.686 million pixels. each using 24 bit (8-bit color on 3 chanels) which is 88Mbit/s. if you output 60 of those that is 5.3Gbit/s. 1GB/s = 8Gbit/s. Okay okay you wouldn't always throw a full image so lets call it 2.5Gbit. You were still using quite a lot of the bandwidth on the image alone, so from my understanding most of the interface communication was more related to ""who did what"".  and in AFR you would be handing over a full frame.",Neutral

Intel,"Bingo  Strix is also limited by being RDNA 3.5 and no FSR4, so it's rather dependent on raw throughput, and it can't possibly fit in a comfortable handheld that would last for more than an hour and a half under load.  I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage.

And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.  Besides, Intel already has Nova Lake AX in the backlog, or whatever it's going to be called. Practically intel's strix halo.

That said, I’m pretty skeptical about how realistic that is. **With the recent RAM shortages and rising memory costs**, pricing a new card competitively while still keeping margins doesn’t sound easy at all. Memory is a huge part of the BOM, and we’ve already seen how shortages can push prices up across the board.  So unless Intel is willing to take a serious hit on margins (which seems unlikely), I’m not convinced the B770 will land at a price point that truly shakes up the market.

Intel,"u/Chelostyles Thank you for your inquiry regarding the CPU and RAM upgrade for your Dell Vostro 3670. As much as I'd like to provide my technical insights on this upgrade path, I'm not in a position to provide specific suggestions since this involves hardware modifications to an OEM system.  For the best compatibility outcome and to ensure optimal system performance, I strongly recommend reaching out to your system manufacturer directly. They can provide definitive guidance on supported CPU upgrades (i5-8400 to i7-9700) and maximum RAM configurations for your specific model. We don't want to inadvertently bypass any warranty terms and conditions on your system by providing modification recommendations that might affect your coverage.  Your system manufacturer's technical support team will have access to the exact specifications, BIOS compatibility matrices, and supported hardware configurations for your Vostro 3670 model. They can confirm whether the motherboard supports the i7-9700, the maximum RAM capacity (64GB vs 128GB), and any potential limitations or requirements for these upgrades.  This approach ensures you get accurate, manufacturer-validated information while maintaining your system's warranty protection.",Neutral
Intel,"u/I_like_carsyay  XPS 15 9530 hardware does support Resizable BAR, which is why Intel's system detection shows it as available for both your Arc A370M and Iris Xe graphics. However, the system manufacturer has designed their BIOS interface to prioritize stability and user-friendliness, often managing advanced PCIe features like ReBAR automatically in the background rather than exposing manual configuration options. This approach ensures optimal system performance while reducing complexity for users. I recommend checking for the latest BIOS updates from your OEM's support site and contacting their technical support team, as they would have the most current information about how ReBAR is implemented on your specific model and whether any additional configuration steps are needed to fully utilize this feature.     I've posted an article below in case you haven't yet come across it:  **Helpful Resources:**  *  [What Is Resizable BAR and How Do I Enable It?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090831/graphics.html)",Neutral

Intel,"Late to this, but I'm a 13900K owner. I have not had any issues with stability since applying the BIOS update and haven't noticed any performance loss, so I think this is fine. I did not thoroughly benchmark before and after though, partially because of how high peak temperatures were before the update. I am using a Noctua NH-D15 and a contact frame to reduce CPU temperatures.  Up until a few days ago I would have said that thread scheduling isn't an issue, but then I played the game Maneater and it's basically unplayable unless you use launch options to force the game to only P-cores. There's the Intel ""Application Optimizer (APO)"" utility but it seems abandoned and you can't add your own games if Intel hasn't added a profile. I was a big proponent of E-cores but honestly it seems like a half-baked technology that Intel never put the effort in to support properly.

What I mean is, AMD's strategy with RT was meant to be cheap because it's the way Sony and MS got to have the tech while also not having spiraling hardware costs. Rdna2 is basically the tech those consoles got scaled up and rDNA 3 was rdna 2+.   Rdna4 was basically a rehash of what Sony paid for the ps5 pro.

I'm going to be the first to complain about their lack of software strategy, but their hardware strategy makes sense when you consider they get a tenth of the market share nvidia gets and for the longest time had revenue much smaller than Intel's and Nvidia's.

AMD,"Native is not a magic resolution where everything is correct. This is a statement people keep making that sounds correct if you don't think about it, but it's just flatly wrong.      Tons of geometry and textures have detail that can be smaller than a pixel in games today. The vast majority of effects and basically all the lighting (whether ray traced or not) is initially rendered at lower than native resolution.  TAA is already used in basically every game because of how common deferred rendering is. If TAA weren't used, the flickering and aliasing would be so intense it would make games unplayably bad.    Even if none of that were true, the idea of native being ""correct"" makes no sense. We would have had no need then for antialiasing techniques like SSAA or MSAA.    DLSS and all upscaling techniques today are a form of super sampling. It's just that they trade off spatial resolution and do the super sampling temporally. Using data from past frames is obviously worse than just rendering at a higher resolution in a vacuum. But you need cheap anti aliasing that covers everything anyway. And basically every game needs temporal accumulation (to run effects at sub-native resolution) in order to run fast enough with good enough visual quality anyway. And if you really can create an algorithm that effectively reuses data from past frames, then it can both look better and run faster than native.    Now could there be edge cases where something looks worse? Sure. All you need to do is look at FSR2/3 to see how worse algorithms make a ton more tradeoffs. But with good techniques, there will also be many situations where it can look better.    And if you truly care about quality above all else, then you can turn up graphical settings when introducing some upscaling. You'd have to compare something like ""Native"" with Low settings to DLSS with Medium or High settings (turning up the most impactful graphical settings until the framerate was the same).    Personally, at 4K output,  DLSS is always worth turning on. Your dumb PC gamer gatekeeping is hilarious because PC has by far the best upscaling and the most ways to tweak it.",Negative

AMD,"In 2020, during the RTX 3000 series launch, Nvidia tried to control HU's videos because HU ""did not focus enough"" on DLSS. I believe it was either by refusing to send FE cards, or directly by telling them what to write? Not sure anymore, but after a public outcry and support from LTT, GN, and other outlets, Nvidia reversed their course.  Nonetheless: HU did not take this story well. They were previously indeed focusing on rasterized performance. After this Nvidia stunt, they continued to do that, and it took them until about ~2022/2023 when they finally started properly and broadly testing FSR/DLSS - after it became evident that a) there's enough games that support it and b) there is a demand for coverage from the pubic, because gamers are actually using it.  Even still, a lot of their FSR vs DLSS comparisons did acknowledge that DLSS was better, but the wording was always casting AMD in a better, or at least a good, light. Either FSR wasn't far behind DLSS, or the price differences on GPUs made AMD a better purchase, or whatever other reason they could find, but they had a very clear pro-AMD bias.  Only around the Radeon RX 9000 series release did HU balance their coverage. I believe this was because both companies, AMD and Nvidia, had done so much anti-consumer shit by that point, that the public hated them (almost) equally.  Before this launch, the Reddit majority opinion was ""AMD has shittier drivers, but GPUs are much better value, and we can handle worse FSR for the price difference, also they are much better for Linux and fuck Nvidia for many valid reasons"". After the launch, Nvidia invested into Linux drivers (but had Windows driver issues of their own), AMD did the same shit with pricing, and DLSS pulled away far enough from FSR that the difference became too difficult to ignore. Both companies now have done so much anti-consumer shit in one way or another that they are evenly disliked, imo.",Neutral

Which in turn affects group B who does want those features but can't quite afford or doesn't wanna spend extra money for the Nvidia counterpart.   If amd follow the hate blindly then they'll just be left behind at this point just like how they didn't believe at dlss at first and so did many people including reviewers.

AMD,"To be fair these machines would likely not benefit from FSR4 at all because FSR4 would need so much compute the performance gain of upscaling would be very small. AFAIK, we only have data how FSR4 INT8 runs on mid to high end PC GPUs.",Negative
AMD,but they will still be releasing new apus with rdna3 in 2027 :D  hell the shity steam machine will come with rdna3....,Positive
AMD,Where did you get the info that RDNA3 is going into maintenance mode in late 2027?,Neutral
AMD,"Exactly, not just handhelds and apus/igpus, but also the rx 7700, released just a few months ago, its actually their most recent desktop gpu, newer than any of the rdna4 cards",Neutral
AMD,This will be the most ironic thing on hardware ever lol.. LINUX EXCLUSIVE,Negative
AMD,"DLSS4.5 still looks the same on all cards AFAIK, it's just the performance that differs.   INT8 FSR looks worse, so they'd either have to live with that, or brand it as ""FSR Lite"" or something.",Negative
AMD,"IRC the main issue is that the older architectures lack the AI features required. In which case the fumbling isn't that they didn't want to port FSR4 backwards, but that they completely failed to implement forward planning with earlier architectures.   Which just seems silly with how popular DLSS was.",Negative
AMD,"You can't ""take advantage"" of being the underdog. You are *forced* to be the underdog in the hopes that you will die.  The entire high end is a complete waste of silicon. The xx90 cards shouldn't even exist, but Nvidia doesn't care because they have infinite money.",Negative
AMD,There is a reason their market share dropped below 10%  Most people have stopped buying them.,Negative
AMD,Because this isn't happening. You are describing unreality.,Negative
AMD,It's actually mindboggling just how forward looking Turing was. Here are the features from the Turing architecture PDF:  * ML hardware (tensor cores) * ML based upscaler (was trash initially but aged like fine wine) * Level 3 RT HW with BVH traversal HW (RT cores) * RTRT pipeline (initially a gimmick but DDGI and later improvements changed that) * VRS + Content adaptive shading + motion adaptive shading * Various VR gains (foveated rendering + Multi view rendering) * Sampler feedback and texture space shading * Mesh shaders (clean slate rendering pipeline) * 2 x FP16 (I know vega introduced) * L1+Shmem design * Concurrent INT + FP (IIRC AMD already had) * Improved resource management (tier 2) and binding model (tier 3) * Very efficient vs Pascal (perf/mm\^2 vs perf/watt tradeoff) * GDDR6 * Big memory compression gains * Very good encoder  No doubt their largest leap since ~~Kepler~~ Tesla in 2006.,Positive
AMD,"Yeah it's actually kind of funny to go back and watch all the shit Turing got at the time from everyone, reviewers on down, when in reality looking back Turing will likely be seen as one of the most influential and important GPU releases of all time.   All three vendors make to Turing's base design of shader/ai/RT cores now, and as you said the fact that it took AMD over 6 years to finally throw in the towel, and really only with outside money from Sony, just shows how unconcerned and uncompetitive they truly are.

AMD,So does DLSS 4 and 4.5 on older cards but Nvidia at least gives the user a choice.,Neutral
AMD,"Give the option. Always give the option. Drown it in a menu, hide it behind a couple of clicks, but make it available. There's no excuse. Let people choose their poison.",Negative
AMD,so is dlss 4.5 for older nvidia gpus,Neutral
AMD,"Ok, and DLSS4 and 4.5 have bigger performance hits on each subsequent past generation down to the RTX 2000s but Nvidia still lets you use it anyway. No excuse for AMD. It's *already optional*. Why not give users more freedom of choice? You know, one of the biggest reasons for PC gaming.",Neutral
AMD,"More than native, less than FSR 3.1. So it's still a net positive which I would take with my 7800XT.",Neutral
AMD,"Nvidia gave us an option despite the fact that DLSS4 and DLSS4.5 aren't that huge in difference, basically from good to good upscaler. Meanwhile FS3 vs FSR4 can't even compare  in visuals,  performance hit would make more sense in this case with visual gain. I bet 7900 users at least would appreciate it....",Neutral
AMD,"It's definitely a case of branding issue, they're probably weighing between not releasing it at all or they could brand it FSR 4 Lite.  Or their internal statistics indicate that people buy 9000 series for FSR Redstone",Negative
AMD,It runs about the same as the new dlss4.5,Neutral
AMD,"They could have released an official version with a disclaimer ""it is what it is, don't expect updates"". But they don't. For exactly no reason.",Negative
AMD,Eh.,Neutral
AMD,"Is it worse than FSR3 on these cards? That’s the important question. If it is an upgrade over FSR3, releasing it for these cards:  1. Gives them a meaningful upgrade, and, 2. Increases the userbase of FSR4 cards, reducing market fragmentation and improving the market for FSR. The fact that EVERY RTX card ever released supports the latest DLSS is a big deal.",Neutral
AMD,Nah if Steam Machine hacks it or releases with it that'll be the final nail in the coffin. But it needs massive pushback from big YouTubers otherwise nothing will happen.,Negative
AMD,Why would they?,Negative
AMD,Any release after the release of FSR4 is not ahead of time but late with required penalties.,Negative
AMD,"> ahead of time  where does anyone claim, that the fsr4 int8 version was released ahead of time?  at this point the most likely reason for its release was a disgruntled developer ""accidentally"" hitting publish with an mit license, because they worked on it for ages and were pissed off, that amd didn't want to release it, or it was really an actual mistake.  either way there is now many many months later NO reason to assume, that amd has plans to release the int8 version for rdna2 or rdna3. it wasn't an early release by accident. amd clearly didn't want people to know about it. IF they did, then they would have said, that they are working on it before massive endless backlash about it. they have done the opposite and showed people the middle finger.  and you want people to celebrate a middle finger from a giant tech company?",Negative
AMD,"Because that's what people like to do with AMD. NO matter how good their products are, they're AWFUL.",Negative
AMD,"People seem to forget that all this is based on a leaked beta or even alpha stage backport of FSR4. We don't know why AMD didn't release it. Maybe they didn't have the manpower, so they prioritized RDNA4. Maybe they weren't satisfied with INT8 and switched to FP8 later. Maybe Sony is heavily involved with the development and there are contracts in place that forbid a release. Maybe there are some libraries or technologies they have to license and they just don't want to pay the bills. Or maybe they are gonna release it as FSR 3.5 or whatever.",Negative
AMD,"Yet Nvidia, the company that always been labelled as ""Don't give a shit about gaming, only AI, don't care about gamer"", still have a whole gaming talk show at CES, introduced new GAMING features like DLSS 4.5 and 6x MFG, not only the BEST GAMING FEATURES in the market with insanely wide game support, but coming to all RTX gpus dated back to 2018, 4 generations ago. They also promote a bunch of games and showcase many new AAA sponsored games with those technologies.  If all those things Nvidia did to gaming are ignored and treated as a given, and still got them labelled as ""Don't care about gaming, only focus on AI"", then what the fuck is AMD, who give literally nothing compared to Nvidia, and on top of that treating their consumers like shit by abandoning all the previous gen",Positive
AMD,if they didn't give a shit then they would have no reason to block FSR4,Negative

AMD,"The prevailing wisdom (never confirmed by AMD) is that either RDNA4 doesn't scale down well to a 12/16 CU part suitable for APUs or that they were hoping to have UDNA (which is much more modular for use in dGPUs, SOCs and servers) ready for integration much sooner.",Neutral
AMD,"NVIDIA's shield market was/is absolutely tiny and yet it has supported the platform for 7 years now including with it AI-enhancement features. Fact of the matter is, NVIDIA for all its faults supports its past products extensively whereas AMD just looks for excuses to drop support which is why the former has built up such a monopoly in the gaming segment. People who have purchased both NVIDIA and AMD cards at some point can see the difference in support between the two and it has affected AMD long term even if people dont like to admit it.",Positive
AMD,RDNA 2 and 3 still make up the majority of the AMD users. There's just no excuse.,Neutral
AMD,"That's absolutely true, but it's a new and growing segment. AMD treating it so poorly is such a short sighted move, as carving out the segment is not only good for AMD but for x86 as a whole.  With the way AMD is handling the segment, it leaves the door wide open for Intel to take over, they already have more efficient chips, better iGPUs and XeSS 3 works on all Arc GPUs, whether it's their desktop dGPUs or their oldest and cheapest Arc iGPUs on laptops.",Neutral
AMD,"It is very small, but it's also ine of the few sectors that is clearly growing over the last few years.  AMD run the risk if just tossing it away whilst chasing AI.",Negative

AMD,So is AMD's share of the GPU market.  Because they keep getting all trigger-happy at the sight of their own feet.,Negative
AMD,"Around 6 million sold Steam&nbsp;Decks I wouldn't call exactly tiny …  It's at least enough market-meat to fight over, for Intel *and* Microsoft try to engage on that ""absolutely tiny"" market-niche with Intel through the MSI Claw (among others), and Microsoft wanting to refit their whole OS for it.  So it might be a corner of the market, yet there seems to be enough money to be made to make it worthwhile.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep!  I'm running Bazzite on my Legion GO and use a combination of the Proton variable for FSR4 and Decky/Optiscaler plugin for XeSS.  It's also hilarious to me that the Source release blunder means that, technically, the INT8 code was released under the MIT License.  So they can't even stop people from redistributing it.",Neutral
AMD,"> Your entire perception of what the market looks like is wildly incorrect.  In what way?  The handheld gaming market is fairly niche, but absolutely gaining momentum.  What we know for sure, is that Intel is ready to drop new hardware that is significantly faster than AMD (who have no plans for at least 12 months).  That's a pretty big opening for Intel to grab up market share based on technical superiority alone.",Neutral
AMD,"From what I've seen on my LeGo, it's still worth it.  On the gen1 Legion Go it's actually uniquely positioned to benefit as it has a 2560x1600 screen, so running FSR4 in performance mode nets a better image than a native Steamdeck (1280x800).  The main benefit is that FSR4 doesn't break up horribly like FSR3 does at low resolutions. e.g.  FSR3 performance on most handheld screens is a garbled mess.",Positive

AMD,"According to HW Unboxed, the int 8 version of fsr4 is visually better than xess2 dp4a while having a similar performance impact. It’s an improvement over what’s already there on the market and AMD refuses to release it.",Positive
AMD,"FSR 3.8 is fine; not quite FP8 FSR4, so brand it under FSR3. It can mark the end of the FSR 3.x line.  Not sure why they're being stubborn about FSR4. Honestly, AMD could just use conversion instructions and provide full FSR4 to RDNA3/3.5 and 3.7 (""RDNA4m""). I think, maybe, AMD wants GPUs to support the entire Redstone stack going forward. That's where FSR 3.8 branding makes sense as a standalone upscaler based on FSR4.",Neutral

AMD,"Turing was absolutely forward-looking, but it was also comparatively expensive at launch and didn't offer the big gen-on-gen raster gains everyone had become accustomed to. We know it was the future *now*, but if you were looking at it back then as a Maxwell or Pascal owner it didn't really do much to sell itself.   Meanwhile AMD came out with the 5700XT that offered ballpark 1080ti performance for $399. It's not hard to see why the narrative went the way it did.",Negative
AMD,Turing’s super refresh also addressed the value aspect. I don’t know any unhappy 2000 Super buyers.,Neutral
AMD,Even funnier when you look at Intel and Arc. Arc released with RT and ML in mind and I believe their cards take a lower hit from enabling RT than AMD's.   And even XeSS 2 is getting features before FSR,Neutral
AMD,"And funny how RDNA 1 like 5700XT at the time was treated as gold standard compared to Turing, which everyone trashing on, now RDNA 1 is not even supported for driver anymore, can't run many games due to lacking even mesh shader, zero RT hardware so can't run many new games, and even if it could the experience is horrible with absolutely garbage upscaling and zero feature, the 5700XT aged like rotten milk while Turing is more than fine wine",Negative
AMD,"To be fair ray tracing is still not really a thing that's worth the performance hit, which is what people were saying back then.  DLSS, which is now the real ""magic"" of RT cores, was also ***horrendous*** in its first incarnation, wasn't  *really* needed, and only really got acceptable in late 2022 with DLSS 3.  Doesn't change the fact that you're right about everyone clowning on it but it turned out to be a pivotal tech though...

AMD,"No they don´t always have to be the reason of their own downfall. AMD was an absolute CPU Underdog up to 2018/19 and built their way up with fair prices, meaningful improvements and big promises like supporting AM4 for a long time. My support was rewarded as I got a cheap upgrade possibility by selling my 3600 and buying a 5800X3D.     I gave them my trust with the GPUs too and my old Sapphire 5700XT Nitro+ did a good job by having an awesome buy and sellprice (bought it for 360 euros brand new in 11/19 and for 160 in 02/24) and a good feature support. Why shouldn´t I give AMD another try? The Underdog did deliver a great value for me.",Positive
AMD,"It sucks that their drivers are closed source, but it's far from ""crap"" in Linux.",Negative
AMD,It would be really nice to see Nvidia open up their drivers on Linux because that is a real sticking point for many. We just rely on Nvidia to fix stuff there for us instead of being able to do it ourselves. You would think considering Linux is the primary OS in industry they would support it better?,Positive
AMD,"Maybe it's just me, but going from a 7900XTX to a 4090 was a night and day difference, even in linux. 4090 *just worked*. Whereas the AMD card would have constant driver timeouts and crashes in specific games(especially those that didn't like AMD in the first place) despite being RMA'd twice.  Sure, maybe i got unlucky, but i've had pretty much zero problems with nvidia on linux. Maybe it's because i run a rolling release distro though, i can see it being rough if you're constantly on older versions via LTS or something like bazzite which is immutable.",Neutral

AMD,"If that ends up being the case, which i find highly doubtful, at least on the short-mid term, specially knowing that there's a very real possibility that the AI bubble ends up bursting, there will always be Intel as a secondary option(and even if Intel wasn't there and the AI bubble never bursts, it literally makes no sense for NVIDIA to completely abandon a market where they hold more than 70% of total market sales. What is likely to happen is that NVIDIA puts less and less focus on gaming GPUs, but never stops making them fully)  And if Intel is shit too, i would rather not buy a GPU at all than give money to Radeon again.",Negative
AMD,NVIDIA has 4.5-5 billion a quarter gaming revenue. Why would they drop that market that's low risk and guaranteed. Putting all your eggs in one basket is never a good idea.,Negative

AMD,"Honestly quality FSR 3.1 on 4k looks almost decent, but with the negativity, I can see why they dont want to release an inferior version of FSR4.",Negative
AMD,"Honestly, releasing it with a SPECIAL name would be the best solution. Like FSR4 lite or FSR4 preview name.",Positive
AMD,"Most consumers, even if they have a custom PC, will default to ""install the latest drivers"". If that means negative performance, I can see a good reason why AMD would not release such a driver.",Negative

AMD,"There is a lot of negativity on reddit towards AMD. for upscaling there are two things to consider: quality and performance.

AMD,"The whole ""NVIDIA doesn't care about gaming"" idea has always been absolute bullshit. Obviously no massive corporation ""cares"" in the way we humans might care about something, that is a given. But the idea that NV is somehow *uniquely disdainful* of gamers is childish and facile, and has no basis in observable fact.   If anything, it's the opposite: as someone who has been a PC gaming enthusiast for decades, I think NV has actually done more for me in that position than any other company (except, perhaps, Valve). Obviously they do so for business reasons; but the way they decide to act has been frequently beneficial to PC gaming.  As one massive (for me) example, I remember the first post-CRT decade in the monitor market where 60 Hz was just seen as **the** standard, and that was basically it. Which was very bleak from an action gaming perspective. And what really started to change that whole trajectory was the introduction of G-Sync -- not so much just the technology itself but more so getting the whole stagnant monitor industry to see the value of creating gaming-focused products.",Neutral
AMD,Slight clarification: MFG 6X/dynamic is RTX 5000 only. But all RTX GPU do get the new transformer model for upscaling.,Neutral
AMD,"I'd say the ""Nvidia research to standard feature pipeline"" has been pretty well established at this point... RTX, DLSS, Framegen, Reflex, Gsync, other AI rendering stuff (RR, NRC, NTC)... sure, they're not the ones who ""invent"" them sometimes (although they do contribute a shit ton of research in novel fields that people typically don't know about until it hits consumer products), but they're clearly the driving force behind modern gaming features.   Part of that might be corporate culture, part of it might just be that Nvidia's 90% of the gaming market, part of it is just gaming adapting to the hardware the market provides (if you're a AAA game dev now or developing any sort of technically ambitious feature, you are building your engine/game from the ground up with features like RT/PT/DLSS/Framegen/NRC whatever else from the ground up- future cards are going to have insane matrix math capabilities to support AI, so we take our current gaming computation problems and turn them into matrix math problems- that's just the general hardware market shaping gaming tech).   There's a feedback loop, but yeah, Nvidia's certainly putting in the work, and I'm sure they *wish* they could make an extra billion or two sellings GPUs to gamers on top of their AI profits- current supply and demand doesn't support that though.",Positive
AMD,Preach!,Neutral
AMD,amen probably the best comment ive see in a very long time,Positive

Within a year or two, the OpenCL backend on AMD slowly started [accumulating bugs](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/65924) that blender devs couldn't fix from their end and everyone had to fallback to using CPU rendering, which is magnitudes slower than GPU rendering.

High performing matrix cores were probably a requirement for a high quality temporal upscaler and RT denoiser as well.

So, intead of trees with leaves and branches, you got this clumpy malformation of trees with a bunch of green colors that were supposed to be leaves that looked like something from 10 years prior. The upscaler also wasn't great as Nvidia was trying to make the tensor cores do too many things at once.  DLSS2 was where Nvidia turned the corner. That actually started with shader-based DLSS 1.9 that debuted in Control. This moved to a generalized training algorithm based on temporal multi-frame accumulation (TAA-based). Image softness and ghosting were still issues though, so AMD's contrast adaptive sharpening often provided better results when combined with a basic upscaler.  DLSS3/4/4.5 continued improving upscaler algorithms and models to where we are today. It took years to get to this point because missing pixel information was an issue when upscaling images.

It took nearly **2 years** after G-Sync was announced for VESA to announce their implementation into the DP1.2a spec and still more time after that because the LFC logic had to be built into the GPU (1st Gen G-Sync actually had LFC built-in to the custom ARM SBC they were using as the Display Controller+TCON).

AMD,"i mean technically the performance doesn't even matter, it could be a lot worse than what it is and it still needs to be released, because we are living in a dystopian temporal blur reliant development nightmare.  so to get a less shit experience you need a ""good"" ai upscaler given what a blurry unusable mess it is otherwise. fsr4 and dlss 4.5 is still shit compared to true native.  true native means games properly designed to not have temporal blur reliance and to use proper aa like msaa see half life alyx as an example:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckTAA/comments/1i2li6s/this\_is\_half\_life\_alyx\_it\_uses\_4x\_msaa\_no\_ray/#lightbox](https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckTAA/comments/1i2li6s/this_is_half_life_alyx_it_uses_4x_msaa_no_ray/#lightbox) (no spoilers in the screenshots)  clear crisp extremely clean and artifact free and extremely well running graphics.  that is what true native would mean.  it is a unicorn rarity these days, so even if int8 fsr4 would cut your performance by 20% on rdna2, doesn't matter it may still be by far the best experience sadly.  so yeah absolutely useful regardless indeed and it needs to get officially released as soon as possible.  ideally you want fsr4 int8 all integrated and working fine with proton and integrated into major games already when the steam machine releases, so the sooner the better.  gotta be some weird conversations going on between amd and valve i guess in that regard lol.",Negative

AMD,"Do you actually think frame gen is anywhere near as important as upscaling?  I'd say to most people that is a big fat NO. Upscaling actually improves game performance, not to mention it replaces TAA for its own AA. Frame gen is just frame gen, it guesses what goes between frames to make things look smoother. But it doesn't make 30fps have fast inputs like 60fps, or 120fps, and there'll be visual bugs of course, just depends what you notice.  Hell, I basically never use FSR frame gen or anything, which older RTX can use too btw, and XeSS is also getting it.

AMD,">If anything, I'd call the early-to-mid-term ""generic VRR"" monitor space an ""absolute mess"". There were **tons** of displays releasing even many years after G-Sync hit the market (with a pretty damn solid initial implementation) that were almost unusable in actual VRR scenarios due to a complete lack of adaptive overdrive.  Let's not forget that a lot of the ""generic VRR"" monitors also several other issues that were unrelated to overdrive. For example a lot of them had a really, really narrow update frequency where VRR actually worked. With G-Sync it did not matter what your refresh was, it would also be VRR and smooth. It accomplished this by various techniques like doubling frames at the really low refresh rates.   With a lot of the early FreeSync monitors, we had monitors that would only enable VRR at specific update frequencies, like maybe 48-75 Hz and as soon as you had higher or lower FPS than that, VRR would get disabled. It was awful, and monitors didn't advertise their workable VRR-range either so you had to Google and pray that someone had tested it and written about it.",Negative

It's always fine, when guys doing such things out of fun and pure dedication in their spare time, yet \*never\* being rewarded for it, when it gets used commercially by big MegaCorpses afterwards …  There have been countless instances, where corporations blatantly stole open-source stuff, and always got away with it afterwards, reaping the very fruits of some guy's tedious months and years of spare-time labour …  ---- I mean, remember when Nvidia back then stole the code of open-source *SweetFX*/ReShade shader-techniques, integrating it literally 1:1 (with the open-source modders' verbatim comments included in official nVidia-drivers), then tout it as a graphics-revolution *of their own making* as their high-praised **Nvidia&nbsp;Ansel**, only to then blatantly lie about it being stolen to begin with afterwards when it came to light?",Negative
AMD,XeSS DP4A FG is already there for RDNA3 users.  If framepacing issue in Redstone is not fixed it might even be better.,Neutral
AMD,What’s the best option for 7900xtx and ue5 games?,Neutral
AMD,"I understand that argument, but they could release, for example, the int8 model in preview or whatever since there are so many people asking for it. They did it before with unsupported FSR4 games through the GPU Profile Manager.   I really do not believe they would get backlash, because that other model (int8) was already extensively tested by users and reviewers on RDNA3 and RDNA2, including the Steam Deck. The feedback was positive despite the slightly worse image quality than the original model and the lower fps uplift when compared to FSR3, since it provides much better AA.",Neutral
AMD,"Dude, no, you can shit out a broken feature as a mod no problem, nobody expects anything from you. If you release the feature as AMD, Intel, Nvidia, Google, Apple and who ever else you need to have outreach teams, support teams, maintenance, marketing and implementation support teams at the ready. If you fuck up at any of these things people will hear about it and it will make you look like a fool.",Negative
AMD,"It is based on XeFG I believe (since it requires you to have XeSS dlls). Which is AI driven, but it can't use specialized hardware on NVIDIA cards and relies on the CUDA cores instead (with DP4a)  Even the non-AI FSR3 is leagues above lossless scaling, because it has access to temporal information.",Neutral
AMD,Lol how unhelpful,Neutral
AMD,"XeFG has the same frame pacing issues as fsr fg - that is, with either, you should enable vsync and / or set an fps limiter depending on the game. XeFG with XeLL works really well in cyberpunk, but it looked and felt awful until I forced vsync on to both smooth out frame pacing and keep it under 240 fps to prevent tearing. Basically identical to FSR fg ml.",Negative
AMD,DP4A FG is picking the worst option of the ones available.,Negative
AMD,">I understand that argument, but they could release, for example, the int8 model in preview or whatever since there are so many people asking for it.  They should, definitely and I believe they will. They just need to get things on track, they have very good challenges for that and how to handle old games. They cannot use the same approach as mods and they cannot inject DLLs around in any executables.  >I really do not believe they would get backlash, because that other model (int8) was already extensively tested by users and reviewers on RDNA3 and RDNA2, including the Steam Deck.  The problem is not the quality, is how to implement and they will have a hard time explaining the cost per chip, which is not a percentage.

AMD,"I remember MLID claiming Gorgon Point would be something like 18% faster, lol. In reality this is the laziest refresh imaginable. Just a tiny, non-consequential overclock. Still interesting to see actual benchmarks comparing it with the previous gen.",Positive
AMD,So they reduced the size/weight/cooling of the laptop and are running it with lower power resulting in lower performance than last gen but a decent increase in battery life? Sounds like it might be a design choice as to why it's performing so poor.,Negative
AMD,"AMD sucks is back in 2026. Hopefully AMD realizes the massive blunder they made. And it's not because they couldn't compete. They can compete,  they just chose not to. If TSMC alllocation is thr problem, They could use Samsung 2nm for a Laptop right now if they wanted. Or use SF4X for lower end chips instead of TSMC 4nm to reserve their capacity for AI. But they didn't because they decided to not add engineering capacity to their organization years ago.

AMD,"Why these expensive CPU's are paired with high end GPU's in laptops I will never know.   In all real scenarios this laptop will be GPU bound even on low end CPU's.

AMD,Mlid is very good at leaking names and overall architecture but his performance numbers are always bad,Negative
AMD,"If it's just a rebranded same silicon then there's no way it can reach this much, unless there was something very wrong with the original silicon.  Gorgon Point it's just the same silicon, with the same process technology, rebranded with the new branding numbers, the only different is the slight bump in clock frequency, it's very hard to imagine something wow from it.  TBH; 2026 is a bad year for consumer hardware, and AMD has been lazy and overconfident with themselves lately.",Negative
AMD,The early leaks of official AMD marketing slides in China already suggested it being a negligible performance increase. I think the actual product was even worse than that so it was more of a rebranding exercise.,Negative
AMD,That's kinda your fault for listening to MLID. Everyone should know that he just makes stuff up.,Negative
AMD,"I believe MLID speculated that Gorgon Point could at best be like Hawk Point, which actually did come with a pretty decent increase, despite being a refresh like this. He didn't have any real benchmarks on Gorgon Point before they came out.",Neutral
AMD,yes but the other option is intel panther lake where you can have lower power and more performance instead of needing to choose,Neutral
AMD,"They’re using a worse node than Intel now. Their upcoming data centre products are all 2nm with IO die on 6nm. N4 supply is not a valid excuse, and really never was because “muh tsmc” has been their go on excuse since 2020.   Somehow that bottleneck doesn’t apply to everyone else.",Negative

AMD,">I have to think this is a purposeful design decision from AMD when it comes to their processor tuning.  Seems like this is less of an AMD decision than it is a Lenovo decision. They could have easily slapped in an ARL-H or even better a PTL-H chip, got similar perf and battery life, rather than using an Intel -HX chip.   The HX 370 is still strix point, it's not a true HX chip like the rest of AMD's lineup.",Neutral
AMD,"Both chips are fine for mainstream use (heck a modern iPhone chip is probably enough for a lot of mainstream use laptops).  As long as it offers a decent minimum experience (smooth and so on), then the competing thing is going to be price.    Intel's Panther Lake is a bit expensive.  Their 358 and 388 chips especially are in pretty expensive laptops.  If AMD  solutions are cheaper then they can still do okay.",Positive
AMD,"In desktop, sure they're the best. But AMD never had best CPU nor GPU for mobile devices so I don't think they're 2012 Intel. Just your usual weird AMD decision.",Negative
AMD,Because people do more than gaming on these,Neutral
AMD,This is paired with a 5060. It's almost as if there's more to computers than just gaming.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, that's because guessing instead of reading has a very bad hit rate. He just trades reputation on those losses for views.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, he definitely has sources, and often knows about products first. Those who deny this are just incorrect (even if he is extremely obnoxious about this).  However the things he infers from those sources are often uhhhhh... Questionable.  I've been watching him for years and it's kind of like bad technology fanfiction.",Negative
AMD,"he was basing on that based on the uplift from Phoenix to hawk point which was . . . a single data point and probably should have never been used to make predictions. As AMD clearly didn't do that this round and, to my knowledge, has never done previously except with hawk point.  I do think that if the 470 is paired with max speed memory it supports, it's igpu should game \~15-20% faster than the 370 (which only supports lower bandwidth/speed memory). But so far its pretty difficult to dig up any comparisons on that front. But at any rate the lack of FSR4 kinda makes this incremental gain pointless anyways. Lack of AMD actually getting gorgon point in laptops at a reasonable price point just makes it even more Ludacris.  AMD botching it again and again. I think the refresh is fine. Sometimes that is just how product cadence works. But there are so many things they just CANNOT seem to get right in the laptop and GPU space that were easy wins . . . FSR 4, price points, and getting laptops with decent memory specs to get better performance were totally within their control. If we saw gorgon laptops for \~$500 less with FSR4 and +20% igpu gaming . . . those would be legit decent deals. But . . . that isn't what we have.  gorgon point in a premium laptop doesn't make sense IMO unless its a premium laptop at a lower price with some really good bios and power management. Which . . . Lettuce be reality. no laptop OEM is going to put in that kind of R&D for a refreshed chip . . . . If they are gonna do that they should be focusing on zen6 apus right now; which they aren't because AMD sucks at giving support to laptop OEMs.",Neutral
AMD,Yup,Neutral
AMD,"the fact that X3D laptop chips still haven't made it as a more common choice is wild  like you'd think they would jump on that chance but they really did not invest in the needed packaging expansion or something to really push that out in volume  hell, like I said before, if they can get proper eGPU with proper x16 links out (and not just oculink speeds), a laptop with a -50 class mGPU and a eGPU can likely accept a 5090 class easily and have that be actually something of a true ""desktop replacement""  a 9800HX3D with that would be a killer app of a laptop that can likely last for multiple gens of CPU advancement while the GPU gets swapped out more frequently.",Negative
AMD,I think they are much more expensive though. I guess we'll just have to wait until more models roll out and prices stabilize.,Negative
AMD,"Panther Lake is still not on the same level as the Arrow Lake HX chips, it is much slower.     By most reviews Panther Lake is 10-15% faster than the AMD Gorgon Point chips in this video.",Neutral
AMD,Probably not worse. TSMC 2nm is likely superior to 18A.,Negative
AMD,I think some of you are too used to reviewers who use exaggerated and emotionally charged languages. This review has no issues with presenting the benchmark findings which is what is important with a review.,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, agreed. Panther Lake and the HX 370 are in the same performance bracket. Panther Lake is faster than the HX 370 by 10-15% but both are much, much slower than Arrow Lake HX",Neutral
AMD,"In this case, the AMD version more expensive than the ARL-HX version.   That being said, this is something I said was gonna happen when people were debating PTL prices a few weeks ago: new models from both AMD and Intel are gonna reset MSRPs and be more expensive than last years models because of other factors, like RAM/SSD.  PTL-H is certainly more expensive than Gorgon Point, but with the SoC taking up a smaller % of the total laptop BOM, it might not matter much if the price difference between a Gorgon Point and PTL-H laptop ends up being $1800 vs $1850, for example",Negative
AMD,"Yup, people don't often realise this but even back in Zen 3 era (AMD's most competitive era because Intel was on 14nm for half of it), the mobile APU had cut down L3 cache which actually resulted in the 14nm i7-10875H being the faster gaming cpu.

AMD,"It always annoyed me how he glazed hawk point. Are you aware of any sources directly comparing hawk point to Phoenix? I haven't, and can't imagine there was any improvement.",Neutral
AMD,"This laptop is also a year late imo.

AMD,You don't need the expensive version with B390 in a gaming laptop with a dGPU.   The lower end Panther still comes with all the same low idle draw.,Neutral
AMD,compared to the low end chip sure but not the ai 9 line.   Panther lake is basically replacing all of the H ultra 2 chips and even some of the HX chips.  The ones with the 12 xe core igpus may be more expensive but not the ones being put in gaming laptops that will have the 4 xe core igpu,Neutral

AMD,"Pricing is consequence, not the cause. If AMD made 3-4 times more RDNA4 cards those naturally would have been at MSRP and AMD could have sold them all, especially while Nvidia also had not enough supply before summer.

As much as the marketing engine wants us all to believe otherwise, FSR and DLSS are upscaling technologies that were designed to trade performance/framerates for reduced image quality.    The heaviest weight in video card selection should still be basic rasterized rendering performance at your choice of resolution in the games you play most often.   This is what you are going to lean on most often for the life of the card while you are gaming... the rest is situation nice-to haves or concessions of image quality or latency in trade for framerates and perceived ""smoothness.""  Ray Tracing is still inconsistently supported and implemented and comes with a huge performance penalty even in Nvidia's product stack that often requires leaning on reduced image quality or greater latency with upscaling/framegen tech.   It's a tech demo feature that gets a ton of it's value from marketing hype vs widespread support and optimization in games.  I still don't consider RT a mainstream tech, cards that can support it natively while maintaining consistently better than 60 FPS 1% lows are going to land in the 4080 / 5070ti performance class or higher .. which is back in $1000+ territory with the effective discontinuation of the non -80 series 16gb cards in the Nvidia lineup recently.  Cyberpunk 2077, a 5 year old and highly Nvidia optimized game, still struggles to stay above 60 FPS on the 1% lows with RT/medium presets enabled on a 7800x3D machine at 1440p while making the whole experience look like weirdly ""shiny"" like someone poured epoxy over everything.",Neutral

It seems like people also ignore that fast RAM smoothes out the frame pacing and can be the difference between a stutter-less experience and a stuttery mess even if the average frame rate stays the same.

AMD,"Idk. I have seen serious in depth tests by overclockers, and it seems, 6400 1:1 is the sweet spot. The caveat is, it only makes a serious difference when it's running FPS unlocked and the CPU is near 100%, then the fps gains are very much worthy, like from 120 to 160 and low 1% get better as well. The thing about ram overclocking is that you only really see real gains when the CPU is near max, since the 3XD cache gets full and needs to access memory more (like the other comments clarified).     I like tinkering a little (not an overclocker) and since ram was cheap back then (lol) I got a 6400 kit and run at 1:1. Took time and testing, but I had fun, I guess :P     I think for the most part, the fun part was learning. Now I know a lot more about ram and their settings. However, if I was time constrained and had less patience, I would just run 6000mhz and the lowest CAS I could find at an affordable range.    I play on 4k, doing 6400 1:1 probably didn't even get any fps gains, was just the fun of tinkering and getting my PC to be as good as possible    I avoided Infinity Fabric overclocking and going too low at the secondaries and tertiaries.

AMD,HUB did some videos proving pretty definitely that DDR5 is a worthwhile upgrade on DDR4 at this point.  It always takes a bit of time for the memory standard to mature and then performance gains become quite real.,Positive
AMD,DDR3 to DDR4 is twice the bandwidth (assuming same timings).,Neutral
AMD,"Even with Zen 2/3, it was still plenty to simply be on 3200Mhz, and anything more was for overclockers/tinkerers.  So not really that much different.    Just like with DDR5, usually 6000Mhz is considered a good sweetspot for affordability and performance.",Neutral

AMD,"I didn't do any official benchmarks, but my sister's old laptop with 4GB of RAM was extremely slow in Win10. After putting Lubuntu it was way faster using Chrome, and was able to open many tabs without slowing down. And that was even before I enabled zRam.",Neutral
AMD,"W11 is the same, it's just that some RAM is allocated and people not in the know see ""hey, 8GB of 32GB is used while idling Windows bad reeee"". It's like they don't want to use any of the RAM they bought.",Negative
AMD,"16gb is fine for most people.  I don't currently build or buy anything with less than 32, but 16 is still fine for gaming.",Positive
AMD,"> Yeah no. 16GB is definitely not enough for most people, even with Linux being less of a memory hog.  16GB is fine for 99%+ of people",Negative
AMD,The X3D cache operates at 2.5 TB/s and DDR5-8400 memory at 67 GB/s per channel.  So you would need DDR5-20000 in an 8 channel setup to match it. It simply is impossible and not even takes into account that much of the X3D performance comes from 10x reduced latency not bandwidth.,Neutral
AMD,"I can back you up on there being a group of people who made that argument. They weren’t completely wrong, but ram tuning is pretty hardcore it’s not like enabling pbo.",Negative
AMD,Friend you're missing a huge asterisks as that uplift is only precent in a very small select number of games.  That reddit is still clueless on RAM scaling baffles me when it's been a discussed topic for as long as I can remember.  I'm of the generation when you bought slower RAM because it was cheaper and OC'd it. Today people just drop hundreds extra for minimal gains on both their CPU and RAM while ignoring their GPUs and worst their PSUs.,Negative
AMD,I experimented on this myself with Overwatch and Rivals:  https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1lluich/14900kks_vs_99509800x3d_4090_vs_5090_some/,Neutral
AMD,"I tested 9800X3D vs 14900KS in 5 high CPU usage games with RT, and 14900KS w8400 RAM was faster overall. Started a firestorm in the overclocking sub where I posted it November.  RAM tuning on 9800X3D 8000C36 made it faster overall in averages, but 14900KS still leads in 1%.  14900KS is on Asrock Z790I Lightning, arguably the best memory OC motherboard for Intel 13/14 series and 9800X3D is on the 2DIMM Apex X870E",Neutral
AMD,"you can get most of the performance by just messing with timings a bit as long as you're not donig bandwidth constrained workloads, though like oyu said there's a higher chance of running into a chip that you can't push that much further even manually",Neutral
AMD,I managed to buy DDR3 right after DDR4 came out and upgraded to DDR4 right when DDR5 was rolling around. Hopefully I can get on the right side of the curve next time I upgrade,Positive
AMD,"Thanks, certainly sounds like something to trust over my anecdotal experience.",Positive
AMD,"I remember Zen2 and especially Zen3 people were pushing more for 3600MT, I don't remember witch gen, but it's the gen they started to let fclk to decouple with ram mhz by letting it run 1:2 or 1:1, and people find out the sweet spot was 3600 and stay 1:1.",Neutral
AMD,I mean my point is why do such a test and use it as an argument when it's not something most people can or even want to attempt.    I'd still like to see it of course don't get me wrong. Like OCing a CPU on custom loop or liquid nitrogen. Fun to push the limits but lets not pretend it is achievable by most users.,Neutral
AMD,"The amount of people that buy 5090 is significantly higher than the amount of people that tune memory. You could ask instead why they review Intel GPUs. My guess is because Intel sends them hardware for free to review and because even that market is larger.     If there's really an untapped audience for it, why not capitalize on it?   The fact that your argument is calling names, shows a lot about who you are.",Neutral

AMD,"4GB will definitely be very easy to run into problems on Windows, for sure.   But regardless, 1-2GB either way isn't making much of any difference on a bigger scale here.  Wont make 16GB 'ok' on Linux when it's not on Windows outside of some fringe cases.",Negative
AMD,"100% of the time when people throw around comments like 'something is true for 99% people', then it is not a statement of fact, but an opinion.",Negative
AMD,"X3D is still limited by Infinity Fabric speed ~70GB/s, so when cache is exhausted (RT, LLMs) the X3D chips are limited by their fabric speed pretty heavily. 14900K will be over 100GB/s with fast ram.  X3D with stuff that can fit in its L3 will dominate, but there are some niches where the old 14900k can out perform due to better available memory bandwidth.",Neutral
AMD,"Honestly i've always overprovisioned my CPU because it's too much of a pain in the ass to upgrade/replace, and by the time i actually upgrade (5+ year cycles) chances are we're on a different socket already so there's no point in upgrading it, so time to get another board+CPU.  That being said, yeah, IMO the PSU is something you should *never* cheap out on. Shitty PSUs take more than just themselves with them to the grave more often than not, absolutely not worth the pittance it costs to just get a good one. Plus you can carry it across multiple builds too.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, I recommended a 5600MT/s kit to my brother because it was half the price of a 6000MT/s kit 3 years ago. The FPS for a Ryzen 7600X / RX 7800 XT between those RAM kits were really close, at most 10% but in average 3% iirc.",Neutral
AMD,That actually means you're very much on the same ideal curve.  You're just not as far along on the time axis as some others.  Not a bad place to be really.,Positive
AMD,"Well that's the same as 6400Mhz with DDR5.  Ideally if you could overclock both memory and IF to the same factor, there's a small reward, but 3200Mhz got you most of the way to what DDR4 was gonna deliver for you.",Neutral
AMD,Because quality discussion should not be limited by what the average Joe wants or can do. I thought this was obvious. Building a computer is also not something most people want or can do yet here we are.,Neutral
AMD,"Eh, just use zram/zswap/swap. No reason to sit there running task killers for what are web browsers and videos games. We've long since solved OOM issues on normal desktops with normal applications. With 16GB and a browser, most times you'll only push a few hundred MB of RAM into any sort of swap unless something is reaalllly choking you out.",Neutral
AMD,"I would be very interested to see benchmarks, and I think with zRam there are probably a few games where memory usage could make a real difference for 16GB computers",Positive
AMD,yeah id say its about bellow 6 GB where it becomes hard to use windows.,Neutral
AMD,Sure that is true it depends on the workload. If the workload is load from ram use once and never use again like LLMs (but who runs them on a CPU?) then benefit from X3D cache is none. But most stuff like game engines run a loop thousands of times on the similar data. It does not have to fit in the cache - even if half of it fits this half is already there. So this also benefits the non-fitting half by not competing for memory transfer with it.,Neutral
AMD,Make sure you do. DDR5 tuning makes DDR4 tuning look like a walk in the park. Had to update bios on two machines just to get rated expo to boot.,Neutral
AMD,Ram OC is a young mans game and a hobby for the unemployed (its a joke),Negative

AMD,"> That being said, yeah, IMO the PSU is something you should never cheap out on.   I did this back in 2015 and now I'm wondering if a PSU ever ages out...",Neutral
AMD,When it comes to gaming i play genres that are CPU bottlenecked so i spend more on CPU than on GPU most of the time.,Neutral
AMD,"Its very interesting to see game engines with x3D. when the model fits entirely inside the 3D cache it runs great, once it exeeds the size and you need to start swapping from memory performance drops off a cliff.",Positive
AMD,"For LLMs or image gen running locally on consumer hardware, you often have to blend the workload and split layers between GPU and CPU (ex: Flux dev FP16 or non quantized models / bigger LLMs) even on a 4090. This uses your CPU and GPU, and then becomes reliant on system RAM bandwidth, while also still giving pretty high performance. It's why people can run huge models on a 4090 and it still be pretty fast. 14900k is better in this case.   Same with RT - in RT games, they seem to miss L3 cache and hit system memory (I don't know why). Granted, most people are GPU bound for RT, so they'll never notice, but technically here the 14900k can also perform better.   Niche stuff that most people won't care about or notice, but still a thing.",Neutral
AMD,"If it isn't sufficient for new capacity needs or if it fails...that's pretty much it.  I've had maybe one PSU failure in 20+ years of building my own PCs, usually I am replacing when I need more powaaa",Negative
AMD,Bad PSUs are definitely still a thing.,Negative
AMD,"They certainly can, capacitor degradation is a real thing, especially if you are having many transient loads. Also the RTX 30 series and newer are more prone to transient spikes of 2x their rated wattage (e.g. 350W to 600W+ for a microsecond) that can cause Over Current Protection to engage. Not *quite* the same as aging out, but PSUs are subject to the same time decay as everything else and feature enhancement. If you have a newer GPU, it's worht getting a ATX 3.0 or newer PSU, for that plus the native cable to deliver 600W in a single cable for high power GPUs.",Neutral

We are reaching the point of AMD's Skylake era stagnation where they only release CPUs that offers very little performance uplift over last generation for a lot more power consumption and costs, which is also another reason led me to choose the 7800X3D as my upgrade path from my previous R5 7600.  I think i will be staying on this beast of a gaming cpu until at the least Zen 6 3D or tbh even until AM6 at this point, and i think everyone else with similar gaming performance should as well.",Positive

AMD,"Yeah, it's an overclock with a warranty. The decision tree is pretty simple:  - If you're upgrading from a previous generation to this one, you might as well go for this part since it's a marginal cost increase for a marginal performance increase over the other parts in the generation. - If you're already on on a current generation, there's no reason to get it.",Neutral

AMD,It's still frustrating that Zen 5 seems to \*need\* a lot more than 32MB of L3 to see bigger gains over Zen 4.  At least for gaming.  Basically makes all the Zen 5 lineup except the Vcache parts kind of pointless unless you can get them for roughly the same price as a Zen 4 equivalent.

AMD,The 7800X3D is to these what the 5700X3D was to the 5800X3D. Zen 5 is a pretty flawed architecture because it's gains are limited by some bottlenecks. Zen 6 should alleviate it and addore cores.,Neutral

AMD,Such nonsense. It has been 1 release and despite the uplift being relatively low in games compared to other zen releases the 9800X3D is still double digits faster than the 7800X3D. Something that did not happen in the Intel Stagnation Era which went from Sandy Bridge through to Rocket Lake. 11 gens of upgrades.  This is 1 release and a mid cycle refresh because they are getting enough top bins to make it worth selling a marginally higher tier part for a marginally higher price. It is effectively a KS variant but without the huge cost increase.  So saying 1 gen and a KS bin equates to the stagnation era is just absurd.,Neutral
AMD,"Right, but 7800X3D was  450$ on release, every new CPU is going to be terrible value compared to older generations, thankfully AMD isn't Intel so both are on AM5. Prediction time: 10800X3D on release is also going to be bad value compared to 9800X3D",Negative

AMD,"25% more power for 5% more performance looks like a mediocre overclock. Hardware Canucks' review shows how much hotter the 9850X3D is at gaming for barely any performance increase, including the aforementioned power draw increase.  I guess a lot of early 9800X3D buyers might have a sample that can be overclocked to achieve the same or better performance than the 9850X3D, during the launch window they were not binning any CPU whatsoever so there should be a lot of silicon lottery winners out there.",Neutral

I would say the 9850X3D is worth it for your rig.  However, it's not a universal truth - if you're running a much older GPU, or have a lower system budget, then something like the 7800X3D makes more sense.

AMD,"Zen 5 isnt a stagnation per se, nor is the Core stagnant itself.   If it truly were Intels Sky/Kabylake era... A Ryzen 5 wouldnt have been around 10-20% faster in MT/ST every fucking Gen except Zen 5 since that was only a major core and arch overhaul that should have been delayed a year for the overhauled IO Die that comes with Zen 6. Would even say it makes sense its a stagnation in performance in gaming and workloads that DONT use AVX512 instructions.   Stuff that uses AVX512 instructions is a major uplift Zen 4 vs 5 since they broadened the pipelines, as well as doing a true AVX512 implementation.    You could also say, why didnt they use Zen 4/5 Dense instead of the normal Zen Core structure, since it iant missing anything the Big Zen has...  I can tell you, because the performance uplift came from a combination of frequency and architecture itself.  Zen Dense clocks alot lower in some cases, which sure, gives you more cores, but in turn ruins the gains the Arch ITSELF has to offer, which scales with frequency to a certain point.   Then there is also the issue with Zen 5 lacking internal bandwidth and external (DDR5) in 1:1 mode. Which shows up, since a 9950X3D despite lower max boost clock, is faster than the non 3D. Same will be with the 9950X3D2, will be faster, since both CCDs will have access to a big chunk of extremely fast and low latency brick of storage.  Zen 6 will definitely be a massive change, since it comes with a 12 Core CCX, the reworked IO die for alot higher memory speed aka more bandwidth from the get go and a refreshed Arch which takes the groundwork of Zen 5 and iterates on it.   Zen 5 is a stopgap and rework of the old Zen 2/3 Arch.  Its basically what Zen/Zen+ to Zen 2 was. A major groundwork rework, but nothing spectacular for performance.   Imo, calling AMD stagnant like Kaby Lake-Skylake Era is not fair. Especially looking at all the facts, Kaby Lake to Skylake you were lucky to get single digit improvements evey Gen. Which is only true for Zen 5 and only when forgetting that Zen 5 is also used in stuff more than just gaming.",Neutral

They continued to hold prices at almost 5070Ti (50€ more) retail price for about 3 months after release.   You guessed it, I got a 5070Ti and got my sister a 5070Ti on release of 9070XT.  Thereafter 5070Ti fell in price by 50-100€ and only about 4-5 months after release, 9070XT fell in price and then kept falling and falling until it was 200€ less than 5070Ti and you could get one for 615€ at its best pricing (multiple times in Europe) while cheapest 5070Ti were 770€ for a long time.   Personally I would still pay 150€ more for 5070Ti over 9070XT, it’s just a better card with better software stack and better support.   So AMD again snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. I’m 30 years old, been a PC hobbyist since I was 7-8 (when I first build my PC). I seen AMD fumble it so many times, that it feels like it it’s just their personality trait.

Nvidia's shares literally 10x-ed in value since the start of the AI boom - they can lose half their value to the bubble popping and still be 5 times better off than they started. Plus, Nvidia's cards are still largely general-purpose, they're not AI training ASICs, and can thus be easily repurposed for other types of compute.

I don't play many intensive games so i havent noticed a diff there but in professional creative softwares there's been a huge leap in performance (premier, photoshop, illustrate, and blender)  If you just want to game that's a good setup, as long as you're fine with medium-low graphics (also some new singleplayer titles like indiana jones might not work since they have raytracing you can't turn off, and the 2060 struggles with that feature)",Neutral
AMD,It is but.  I would advise you to save more and spend a better time.,Positive
AMD,Yeah but I would spring for the RTX 2060 Super instead since it has 8GB VRAM and a wider memory bus (The VRAM gets 448GB/s instead of 336GB/s).  I had a similar setup and it was really good. There's also a good upgrade path from there.,Positive

AMD,"You can probably go up to a 3060 or 4060 and a 5000 series cpu on this budget if you're savvy. make sure your ram is DDR4 since thats still relatively cheap. get your motherboard and case second hand (this'll be a big money saver). Find a power supply on sale, I picked up a 750w corsair one on amazon for 50 (usually 80). Could also get a HDD rather than a SSD since it'll be cheaper, will be a lot slower to boot though. but again, if you're here for lower-performance gaming it might not make too much of a difference. I have a 1tb HDD I store my games on and a 300gb SSD I use as my boot drive/easy access storage.",Neutral

AMD,Thank you for your help! And could you give me a quick explanation for your changes? I'd like to know more about what will eventually be my pc.,Positive
AMD,"slightly weaker cpu bcs that one was overkill  newer version of same cooler  different, slightly cjeaper mobo.  cheaper ram at the expense of a slight loss in CAS latency  2tb ssd bcs 1tb isnt enough  9070xt is amd's best gpu rn, competing with the 5070ti in performance  saved a bit on the case  saved a bit on the psu  just realised you needed a monitor. uhhh  change ssd with \[this\](https://de.pcpartpicker.com/product/hkmNnQ/patriot-p400-lite-2-tb-m2-2280-pcie-40-x4-nvme-solid-state-drive-p400lp2kgm28h)   and get that monitor",Neutral
AMD,"The 5060ti is underpowered compared to the 7800x3d. I’d rather get a bit cheaper of a processor like a 7600x and a faster GPU, either 9070xt or 5070ti depending on cost and features you want",Neutral
AMD,"If I choose the 12GB RTX 5070, the VRAM capacity won't limit performance, even at 1440p?",Neutral
AMD,"I recently upgraded to a 5070 from a 2070super paired with a 5800x processor. It maxes or nearly maxes out everything I’ve thrown at it so far (Oblivion Remaster + Battlefield 6 + Elden Ring / ER Nightreign mainly) at 1440p. The VRAM usage would start being a problem at 4k or in the coming years with new games, which is also when the capabilities of the card would have games running poorly anyway.   If you can’t push all the way to a 5070ti or 9070xt the 5070 or 9070 are very capable cards at 1440p.",Neutral
AMD,"The 5070 is about 40% faster than the 5060 Ti. If there was a game that needed more than 12GB of VRAM to play well at 1440p, it won't play well on the 5060 Ti.",Neutral
AMD,9950x3d,Neutral
AMD,"If you plan to use it for work and you don't mind higher price, pick 9950X3D. 9850X3D/9800X3D is the best for gaming (it doesn't mean that it can't handle work related tasks) but 9950X3D is more useful for work.",Positive
AMD,"If you are using your PC for professional and compute workloads, then get the 9950X3D.  If mostly gaming with lighter workloads, then get the 9800X3D.",Neutral
AMD,"If you're not actually doing any meaningful work yet, 9850x3D would be better. With that said for $50 more (plus the gift card) to get to the 9950x3D, personally that's what I would go with. Regardless of what CPU you go with, get a reasonable cooler. Dual tower like a Peerless Assassin or Phantom Evo, NH-D15 G2, etc. Water cooling I have no clue, I personally prefer air.",Neutral
AMD,"of course 9950x3d lol, cuts the compilation time by almost half",Neutral
AMD,"From what I've read, they're both very close. It sounds like you already got RAM, but Microcenter has good bundles on the cpu, motherboard, and RAM for almost the same price as just the cpu.",Positive
AMD,"9800x3d for gaming (9850 has bad power efficiency)  9950x3d for productivity  Honestly, if you have to ask whether you need a 9950X3D, you probably don't.",Negative
AMD,Do I really have to be concerned about the higher temperatures and power usage of the 9950X3D?,Neutral
AMD,"I’m in Europe, so no MicroCenter, NewEgg or other deals available for me(",Negative
AMD,"the 9850x3d and the 9950x3d are two completely different chips, I wouldn't call them close.",Neutral
AMD,Not as long as you have a sufficient cooler.,Neutral
AMD,only you can answer if you care about the power usage. The higher temperatures mean that you would benefit from better cooling/airflow but the wouldn't release a chip that you couldn't cool.,Neutral
AMD,You can also undervolt and overclock the CPU for more performance with less power and heat.,Neutral
AMD,That's too bad. Should have been obvious from the currency signs!,Negative
AMD,"desktop hardcore would be the way to go here.     The BC250 is cool and fun, but it was cool and fun when it was a cheap way to tinker. With a price of 275 europe dollars, you're way better off with that 5600x machine.      I have a 5600x and a 3060ti (about 25% faster than the rx6600) and this thing RIPS at 1080p and handles 1440p surprisingly well. Mine was about $250 United States Dollars after I sold my old parts in the old build (It was $529 before selling the parts)",Positive
AMD,it costs like 160$ on aliexpress and you can buy the rest of the stuff for less than 60$,Neutral
AMD,"Thanks for your reply, although a 3060ti would definitely be even better :')  But the problem is I don't have anything to sell, my old PC is probably worth €50 used at most x)",Positive
AMD,Sell the parts separately and you can usually squeeze a bit extra out.   Regardless the actual PC is a way better option. I've also heard the bc250 uses a ton of power at idle,Positive
AMD,"I was planning to keep my old PC (it's an ATX PC) to turn it into a small emulation console and give it to a friend, so I won't be able to recoup the costs  And it's true that the BC250 card has more drawbacks than a regular PC :(",Negative
AMD,Ok well the 5600x PC you mentioned seems like a really good deal,Positive
AMD,"Unfortunately, the offer just sold out while I was still thinking about it haha, these things happen :')  I'm waiting to hear back about the AMD card in the meantime; it's likely to sell out quickly too 😅  But if I see another offer like the first one, I'll know not to hesitate!",Neutral
AMD,Damn,Neutral
AMD,This is why I still use a bios speaker.,Neutral
AMD,How long are you waiting before freaking out?,Neutral
AMD,Any beep error? No bios popping up? Thinking it could need a BIOS update,Negative
AMD,"I looked through the manual, no troubleshoot led, you’ll need a speaker, but like others say might need bios update, reading through the manual it’s a pretty old board and while it supports new chips it might not have the bios for it.",Neutral
AMD,motherboard needs bios update to support 5000 series iirc. i have experience with the exact same board. check the compatibility list on their website  edit: when you say confirmed 5000 series ready do you mean you did the updates with a compatible cpu installed,Neutral
AMD,Make sure you are putting your ram in all the way. It might seem scary how hard you have to push sometimes but I would double check.,Neutral
AMD,"Me too, until they randomly beep on startup and freak you out for a second.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, I’m thinking I need to get something :/",Neutral
AMD,"First time I tried it, I waited somewhere in the 15-20 minute range? After that, I’ve been trying things, waiting a few minutes, and then trying something else.",Neutral
AMD,"Unfortunately I don’t have a speaker so I can’t hear any errors.   Nothing pops up at all, monitor says that it’s not detecting a signal.   I’m worried about BIOS, although it’s supposed to be “Ryzen 500 ready.”",Negative
AMD,"Gotcha. Supposed to have the BIOS for the CPU, but I have been worrying about that.",Neutral
AMD,"I am worried that it needs a BIOS update, but I’m seeing that it should support AMD AM4 Socket Ryzen 5000  Edit: I did not update the BIOS, I was reading the box. I’m new to PC building, so I assumed that meant the motherboard would have the correct BIOS?",Neutral
AMD,I believe that the RAM’s in (heard that click) but I’ll double check!,Neutral
AMD,"I’d take it to a PC shop and have them run some tests, when I built my first pc It wouldn’t turn on and I found out it was because my RAM wasn’t set in enough :P I think you may need a BIOS update and a PC repair shop can do that for you.   Is your Monitor cable connected to your GPU? Make sure it’s in one of those slots and not the motherboard",Negative
AMD,"it does.   https://www.asrock.com/MB/AMD/B450M-HDV%20R4.0/index.asp#CPU  scroll through the list and find ryzen 5 5500. has to be at a specific bios version or higher. to do the update you need a compatible cpu like ryzen 1st 2nd or 3rd gen installed in the socket and use a usb stick that you configure on a separate computer with the update. some updates need to happen in a specific order so you’ll have to update it to potentially 2/3 versions before finally getting to the one your cpu is on.   the only pain in the rear part is having to use an old cpu to do it. if you’re up for the challenge and willing to use some extra cash to buy a used old cpu for this one specific thing then go for it, it’s pretty fun and a good intro to pc troubleshooting.   you could also just take it to a shop that would have one lying around and pay them to do it",Neutral
AMD,"I was worried that might be the case.  Also made sure it’s connected to GPU, not motherboard.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, if you move to 7800X3D (or 9800X3D), your 2060 will work at 100% efficiency with games like CS2, so you should see max possible FPS your GPU is capable of + smoother feeling as 1% lows will also be extremely high (compared to 9400f).  It's unbalanced, yes, but for games like CS2, 7800X3D (9800X3D) is the way to go to maxing your FPS in CS2 no matter your GPU.  Your PSU is enough as 7800X3D (9800X3D) barely sips power while gaming.",Neutral
AMD,"if you play 4:3 low it might be ok, you would 100% be able to put up with it for awhile with a decent experience however hitting around the rx 4060 mark or something close to  it really would be perfect, I did use a 7800x3d and a rx 600xt for cs2 and upgraded to a rtx 5070 and didn't see a massive difference",Positive
AMD,"Worth it because GPU’s aren’t a huge factor for games like CS2, and it’s just more worth it getting onto a new platform with an old card than no new platform at all",Positive
AMD,7800x3d will be fantastic for those games. X3D is perfect for your use case. Look into the 7600x3d as well there is a meaningful discount.,Positive
AMD,"not a bad choice. if you can also afford a gpu upgrade, 5050 is a solid option. regardless a cpu upgrade should be good for what you want.",Positive
AMD,"Look up how much DDR5 RAM costs before making any decisions; AM5 and the 7800x3d require DDR5 RAM (which has seen massive price hikes in most markets), and are not backwards compatible with your existing DDR4. I’d go LGA1700 (make sure it’s a DDR4 motherboard so you can reuse your RAM) with a 12th to 14th gen i5 or AM4 with a 5600 to 5800xt (zen 3 x3d will be silly money, even used) depending on price and availability.  I’d recommend a GPU upgrade first - used 30 or 40 series (which particular model depends on your market and budget, get something 60 class or higher with at least 8gb of vram, preferably more) or new 9060xt (ideally the 16gb version if budget allows).  Also, compare your exact make and model of PSU to the SPL PSU tier list, and if you do upgrade it, go for a grade A or B and don’t re-use any old modular cables (PSU cables are not interchangeable, you will fry something).",Neutral
AMD,"Dont get a x3d if you're going to skimp out on a GPU, it will do you no good.",Negative
AMD,Thanks for your reply. Really helpful and resolved my doubts.,Positive
AMD,"I hope you dont mind if I piggy back off of this.   But, I just made reddit and im to new to post in most places lol...   I have a 9800x3d and looking for 1440p 144hz gaming. Looking at the Asrock Steel Legion 9070xt as it's not the gigabit, and its under 1k CDN.... do you have any suggestions or maybe I should wait until I found a discount on something like the XFX?   The only reason im upgrading is a guy at work sold me a full build no gpu for 1k cdn and my pc is from pre covid. So figure its time. Currently have my 1660ti in the pc running with the 9800x3d lol",Neutral
AMD,"I'd also like to replace the GPU, but the CPU is my priority. Do you think I will be fine for 1/2 years more with my 2060?",Neutral
AMD,"Eh, I think they'd benefit more from a new CPU, especially in CS2 and Fortnite. If they do all low, then theor GPU can still maybe add 50 percent more frames and the dips will be 2-3 times higher, even on the same GPU.  Your recommendation lines up more for casual AAA gamers.",Positive
AMD,"I'm aware of the DDR5 prices right now, but I want the upgrade to be as futureproof as possible. Buying a new gpu wouldnt help me as much because i play CS in 1280x960 resolution on low settings. I know it's not the great time for buying ram but I think I got a pretty good deal (for these times) on 2x8gb 6000mhz 30cl for about 900PLN (like 250USD).",Negative
AMD,It will too for this use case,Positive
AMD,"If you do make the move, it's recommended to reinstall Windows as you're switching from an old Intel platform to a brand new AMD platform.  Enjoy the new upgrade!",Positive
AMD,"Steel legend is a solid card, honestly just for whatever is cheapest.   Look into the base 9070 as well if the savings are large it could be well worth it.",Positive
AMD,i personally dont even think the 2060 is viable now.,Negative
AMD,"I will keep that in mind, thank you very much!",Positive
AMD,I definitely considered it multiple times. But. 1k is what im ok spending. Thats where im limiting myself.   My last pc was 7 years. I expect this one to be the same too,Neutral
AMD,It really depends on the games you play,Neutral
AMD,"""Bottleneck"" refers to an extremely tightly defined combination of components (which you know), in-game settings (which you don't know), the games themselves (Black Myth), and the display resolution (which you don't know).  There are too many unknowns here for anyone to say anything but ""Eh, maybe?""  Even if you are, just change the settings so you aren't.",Neutral
AMD,"Depends on so many things. The game, the resolution, and the target fps. For example if playing 1080p 240fps, then absolutely. If playing 4k 60fps then no.  For black myth wukong at high settings 1080p 60 fps the devs recommend a 5500 so you should be ok but just barely. Anything higher than 60 fps and you will run into issues",Neutral
AMD,"Thats a terrible cpu honestly.  Its good ONLY if youre using it as an APU, but even then, its still bad.",Negative
AMD,"Im planning to play black myth, thatss why I wanna buy a gpu sir",Neutral
AMD,"Probably not a whole lot, black myth is more gpu intensive than cpu from what I know.   If you want to upgrade your cpu too a ryzen 5700x would be a nice drop in upgrade for not too much.",Neutral
AMD,No system is going to be the same so it’s impossible to give accurate information,Negative
AMD,"A Ryzen 5 5600X, Gigabyte B550 Aorus Elite AX V2, and RTX 2070 pulls 94 watts from the wall through a Corsair CX650M PSU.  Because it is doing, right now.",Neutral
AMD,If you care about idle power consumption a lot you should be looking for an intel cpu or monolithic am4 one ig. Chiplets aren't good in that department.,Negative
AMD,But perhaps some info from HWmonitor if you can?,Neutral
AMD,You recon GTX would eat a lot?,Neutral
AMD,"Seen some YT and where at some point some measurements were below 10-12Watts on CPU package and my current is about 15Watts, GPU is another another 15-18Watts rest is the motherboard and rest of bits.",Neutral
AMD,The only valid measurements are those obtained by power plug meters and not by hwinfo or other polling software.,Neutral
AMD,"Based on your specs and PCPartPicker, you are at approximately 500 watts. If you are running 860 watt psu, that is enough headroom. I had a similar issue, and I learned to always double my wattage. If the PC part picker says 850 watts, I go for a 1600 watt psu.  The other issues could be:  1. Thermals too high under actual use, not light work or idle, but gaming? PC will shut off to avoid overheating. Can the PC breathe?  I keep mine about 2 to 3 inches off the floor and 4 inches away from the wall. even got a floor fan to push air up into the case.  2. RAM: Did you try with one, then two ram sticks, each slot?  3. Bad Motherboard.  I've RMA'ed my fair share.",Neutral
AMD,What has event viewer been saying?,Neutral
AMD,At this point it's just self-sabotage.,Negative
AMD,"This does not bode well for RDNA4 users as AMD has already confirmed a radically different design in RDNA5 with the implementation of radiance cores which handle BVH traversal in hardware, as well as aggressive changes to ML.",Negative
AMD,It feels kinda insane that we’re at the end of the line for RDNA. I remember when GCN was still at its peak with the release of the RX480.,Neutral
AMD,"I was about to get a 9070 XT because AMD is just too good on Linux, now I'm heavily considering going back to Nvidia just because how they support dlss.",Positive
AMD,They're probably going to do the same thing for RDNA4 as well which is why I kinda ignored the 9070XT alongside my 7900XT being a constant headache recently as it's constantly doing display crashes on the new monitor despite trying every trick I know of. UDNA is quite the different architecture and while should be a nice improvement; you have Nvidia providing their fanciest upscaling models for cards released in 2018 😭. AMD can't even remember their last generation.  I wonder if my next upgrade is going to be a contest between Rubin or Celestial instead. I'm not sure where AMD gets the notion that they can charge such premium prices for a bargain bin product which is something I'm saying as I've owned 3 different cards from them lol,Negative
AMD,"Really unfortunate considering FSR4 still looks far better in motion than FSR3 in most games, and only has a small drop in performance, but you can run at a lower preset because the image quality is still better than FSR3 at a higher preset. Runs great on 7000 series on games like cyberpunk.",Positive
AMD,"Honestly. Considering how amazing they were up until this point when it comes to long time support, I am baffled by this move.",Negative
AMD,"AMD deserves the same backlash that Nvidia and Intel received, when they tried to f\*ck us over. I kept saying this over and over but as an ex-Nvidia long time user, when i decided to give AMD a chance, i thought i'd be treated better. I had no clue what better meant, back then but i did know that i hoped that i'd receive timely updates, tech being trickled down to previous gens, proper support for those older gens, etc. And above that, something extra (say some features that nobody expected on a gen that has been tagged as being ""old"", for example).   It's fair to say i got none of those. Even worse, i pride myself on being rather technically inclined and i could not, for the life of me, solve some of the underlying issues that came with their GPU. I still love it, i will still use it until it breaks but it will also be my last AMD gpu.   There's one thing i hate the most, when it comes to these tech companies: not giving me a choice. Regardless if that choice comes with any type of penalty (battery life, performance, etc.). Give me the choice and let me suffer the consequences of it. Make sure everything is written down in the ToS so nobody can claim any sort of damages and let us have our fun.",Negative
AMD,"AMD is so great at shooting themselves at the foot, i dislike Nvidia as much, but at least they made the newest DLSS 4.5 available for older models. AMD, this is the reason your not gonna get a bigger market share if your gonna fuck your current customers and poteional new ones.",Negative
AMD,It really is inexcusable at this point considering they already developed it and it already works with experimental code leaked back in August 2025. Just release the damn thing for rdna3 and rdna2 and put out this PR dumpster fire. You're making Nvidia look like the salvation army.,Negative
AMD,AMD is being the android of the GPU world whereas Nvidia is being apple charging that GPU tax but providing software support to older GPUs 😂,Neutral
AMD,If I wasn't a Linux gamer I'd be on a 5070ti. But I am and AMD is easier on Linux.,Neutral
AMD,If they do that I will game more on dual boot linux which will have native support of those features.,Positive
AMD,"That sucks. I have spent multiple hours watching YouTube videos and downloading zip files, modifying and reinstalling drivers, and on and on, just trying to get fsr4 to work on two game. Tried following every instruction I could find.  All I wanted was better visuals on my rx6600 on 2 games, being fully aware it does not have as good performance. But none of it worked. It still looked exactly like fsr3. So I gave up.  I would love an official implementation. Even if it comes with a ""I understand my framerate will be lower"" checkbox.",Negative
AMD,No idea wth amd is even doing its way beyond being dumb,Negative
AMD,"How many more articles do we need, to reiterate how anti consumer and pro AI, AMD is being at the moment...",Negative
AMD,"As linus gave the bird to nvidia , now i say fuck you AMD!!",Negative
AMD,"AMD left my 6900xt Liquid Devil in the dust so I went back to Nvidia. They support the CPUs until the end of time but not the GPUs and I have to wonder since Lisa is related to Jensen, maybe they are colluding.",Negative
AMD,Hardware limitation ?,Neutral
AMD,"how about we stop thinking fake frames, fake upscaling,fake hd texture and such for games????",Negative
AMD,"7900xtx will be the last amd card I ever buy, and it will be known!",Neutral
AMD,I'm too stupid for this. Can someone ELI5 for a 7800xt user? Is my card already EOL? I know technology moves fast but damn that sucks.,Negative
AMD,The same thing will happen to RDNA4. I hate Nvidia as much as the next guy but at least they support their hardware pretty well.,Negative
AMD,"I got a new system with a 9070 XT, First AMD card in nearly 20 years. Never again. For all the BS NVidia does their software is light years ahead of AMD.",Positive
AMD,Gotta be a marketing thing right? Working with Sony or Valve to bring it to their steam machine or console? They have first rights to it and whenever they roll it out on their product only then can it go public.,Neutral
AMD,Amd is so stupid man,Negative
AMD,"I doubt people complaining is going to change anything.   Also the Radeon team feels like AMD before the release of Zen CPUs, and what led to the release to something like the Zen CPUs was a change of leadership, so maybe that's what the Radeon department needs.",Neutral
AMD,damage has been done to the radeon brand. Now its interesting when will amd cave in to demands,Neutral
AMD,Never amd again,Negative
AMD,I feel like the perfect analogy for this is AMD is democrats and Nvidia is republicans. Nvidia keeps doing terrible things but AMD stumbles every possible step of trying to be a real competitor to the point where it seems it’s on purpose.,Negative
AMD,They're just taking a page out of Nvidia's play book by artificially locking software features behind newer cards to force people to upgrade. It's planned obsolescence and was always intentional.,Negative
AMD,Not completely defending AMD but I think one issue is AMD still seems on the fence how it's implementing the rest of the 'redstone' suite where FSR4 is just a part of.   Int-8 might be viable for just FSR4 but let's saying to put it out there just so when the rest of 'redstone' features are involved it just stops games from working completely?  the FSR4 might just be math but the rest of Redstone is some for of machine learning which I don't know how much is hardware bound or not anymore.   You're just creating TWO versions of FSR4 at the end of the day.   I think AMD will create even more chaos when they release their new hardware and decide to go another direction making 9070 users feel the same lose in value.,Negative
AMD,I personally don't see the issue. I didn't have DLSS on my GTX 1080,Negative
AMD,"Maybe, just maybe, it's not as straightforward as it seems to the layperson.",Neutral
AMD,Can they even release that version? Maybe they wanted to support the older cards but decided the licensing costs for some technology was too big for too small of a user base.     Edit: I did some research and it appears the new PS5 Pro upscaler based on FSR4 is gonna be available next month. So it seems likely that AMD is still working on that leaked backport. That means that as of now we don't really know that they are not also gonna release it for RTX 7000 cards.   However with RX 6000 not getting new features anymore we can safely assume that these cards will not be getting FSR4.,Neutral
AMD,"I think they are going to do something about it because at this time it's actually just dumb for them to not have anything at all. While I do think people shouldnt be buying cards based on promises or wishes of support not promised, there has just been too much between the ""leak"" of FSR4 that works on the older architecture and Nvidia passing DLSS 4.5 to RTX 20/30 while they were trying to sunset RDNA 2 and 3. On top of the fact that there are still so many RDNA 2, 3 and 3.5 devices still being produced and sold like consoles, handhelds and laptops that arent discrete GPUs that would benefit from the FSR4, it would feel like true malfeasance if there was no solution for them produced. I swapped to AMD originally because the NVidia premium for what I needed was too much. I got my 9070XT on promise of the power vs pricing but that was literally the only thing that kept me off a 5070Ti. If AMD continues down path, I'll probably end up swapping teams again if I can't even trust they'll support the devices that arent even 2-3 years old anymore.",Negative
AMD,"Between this and how they promised to sell 10% of their stocks to scam altman, it’s pretty much written out clearly that a 5 year old can read it.",Negative
AMD,RDNA was an expensive bet that AMD unfortunately lose. Anything after that would be self-sabotage as they have to recover.  They cannot just announce a 5 year skip in GPU product and came back with RDNA4.   They have to sell the known flawed hardware to keep them from bankruptcy. And abandon them quickly is also needed as keep supporting them will damage new products more.,Negative
AMD,You guys really think a aggregate site and some youtubers are gonna bully a massive corpo like AMD into releasing some shit for RNDA 2 and RDNA 3?,Negative
AMD,"Yep, they'll probably lock the newer versions of the upscaler/ray regeneration out of RDNA4 because it doesn't have the ""absolutely necessary make-me-money accelerators"".",Negative
AMD,Yeah I think the 9070xt is my last AMD GPU if they pull this next gen. I hate Nvidia but I also hate having my $700 GPU be obsolete after a single generation,Negative
AMD,7900 XTX owners left in the gutter.,Neutral
AMD,So glad I switched back to Nvidia. I paid more but atleast im confident dlss 5 will work on my current card,Positive
AMD,Yeah this is a big concern. I owned an RX6800 and now a recent owner of an RX9070 and if this trend continues I'll be back to NVIDIA,Negative
AMD,I was telling this to people. The fact they cant release mfg on RDNA4 suggest the hardware gap still exists and we likely will see another hardware gap. Pretty sure rdna5 will have another lockout type thing,Negative
AMD,man no wonder NVIDIA had most of the marketshare if their competition is the dumbasses at AMD,Negative
AMD,What being outclassed by Nvidia in features does to a company,Neutral
AMD,"I don't think itll be that bad, as the basis of FSR4 for the most part is FP8 instruction.   Nvidia is approaching a similar situation. The reason why DLSS 4.5 runs worse on RTX 2000/3000 gpus is both those gpus lack FP8 hardware compute, so those gpus from this point on, is likely to age worse.  ~~RDNA4 also supports FP4 if they manage to shift to those gpus as well.~~",Neutral
AMD,"I stopped buying AMD GPUs 10yrs ago after the Nvidia 1000 series came out (my first card was a Radeon 9500 Pro), and I just don’t get why people still chose them over Nvidia. They’re marginally cheaper, but DLSS is so, so much better than FSR which adds a significant amount of value. It’s not even close.  EDIT: downvote me all you want, but I’m right. AMD only makes sense if you buy into manufactured BS metrics like “performance per dollar” or want to support the underdog even to your detriment.",Negative
AMD,GCN was a future looking architecture. When HD7970 came out most games are still DX9 and pure pixel shader with texture tricks. DX11 Compute shader was a new concept and none of the games supported it. The buzz word back then was tessellation.  GCN was a compute focused architecture that in the end matched DX12 games workload perfectly.  Today most games have 90% compute shader and less than 10% pixel shader.    RDNA was a step back from that. Less flexibility and less predictable performance.  RDNA3 was the worst with its dual issue.,Neutral
AMD,What exactly is happening with your 7900 XT?,Neutral
AMD,If you have AMD you better on Linux.,Neutral
AMD,It’s not like AMD cannot remember their last generation.   RDNA4 is the Turing moment for AMD. They are just late by 6 years.,Neutral
AMD,"You have more patience than me, not getting a simple upscaling upgrade like this was the last straw for me. Sold my xtx and went back to nvidia",Negative
AMD,"It was honestly much more competitive and easier to recommend AMD for the whole GPU package (software, hardware, price) back in the RX 480, R9 390 and R9 290 days.  AMD was usually cheaper, performed the same or better and the software was damn similar.  I loved my R9 290 but everything since the 980Ti Nvidia have just been at the top.",Positive
AMD,People are all about AMD until you switch from Nvidia to AMD and discover all the stuff that needs special attention that worked instantly with Nvidia. A bunch of oh yeah well that’s a known problem with your card.,Negative
AMD,"Same boat I’m in. Not a fan of recent Nvidia things but reality is when it comes to a product I’m paying a lot of money for, I’m going to buy the better product. Neither company cares so I might as well get the GPU with better hardware and software support that’s not even in the same realm as what crumbs AMD gives its users",Negative
AMD,"I mean when US government charges NVIDIA ""special tax"" on them to get bribes, you can't really say everything is competitive.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, as it stands NVIDIA fucked me over on Linux for years (thanks NoVideo Optimus, never once could I get working Wayland support AND have games run well AND have that pesky GTX 960M actually turn off properly until I gave the thing away last year) so I figured that hell would be hard to beat, but AMD as usual seems to have a fetish for self owns so of course that's what they do, bah.",Negative
AMD,Leaked int8 fsr 4 runs even on rx 6000 with performace good enough to be usefull,Positive
AMD,"ELI5 (hopefully):   Only the RX 9000 GPUs have 8-bit -Floating-Point calculator, i.e, it can calculate numbers in decimals.   6000 & 7000 GPUs has 8-bit-Integer calculator (no FP-8), it can only calculate numbers without decimals.  FSR4 relies on FP8 calculations so it works on RX-9000 but not on 6000 & 7000.   But if you just remove the decimals from the numbers (use 8788 instead of 8788.00116) you can just run the same calculations with some rounding inaccuracies.  So people want AMD to make the Int-8 version official on older GPU so they can use FSR4 since it basically looks, performs and works the same with Int-8 code, but AMD wont to that.  Which puts AMD in a similar position of Intel of last decade, i.e, making older hardware obsolete with newer releases. Next gen of AMD GPUs have major architectural changes in about everything so we think even the 9000 series won't receive those feature updates since they will be locked to the next gen GPUs.",Neutral
AMD,"You are missing out on FSR4 upscaling and AMD's frame gen if they ever get it together. So your card still works, but bad upscaling is a huge hit. FSR4 / DLSS is basically free performance that will extend the lifespan of your card. RX 7000 series buyers are getting screwed.",Negative
AMD,"lol no… your RDNA3 is more than fine.  This is just for Frame generation and upscaling. It’s all really bullshit since the latency doesn’t really work for online competition. But for single player it’s pretty good. Still don’t think it’s ready though. You don’t even need to think about these features if you’re happy with your frames 👍  Maybe in 4-5 years when graphics get more complicated (again) and run worse. Then you’ll need some type of FG or upscaling.   But by then, I bet you’ll find a new card",Negative
AMD,Your card is not EoL yet but IRL it’s not too much far away from it as you don’t get any new feature update for it anymore.  It’s effectively EoL by now.  The reason behind this is a hardware limitation. RDNA 3 has really weak AI matrix performance. The top end 7900XTX got 123Tops int8/fp16 while RTX4060 got 242Tops int8/FP8.  Your 7800XT is too weak to run FSR4 or other redstone features. It will be slower than a 4060 with DLSS ray reconstruction. So it doesn’t worth the effort to test and support.  Even a basic community support cost money for AMD. And with FSR4 those RDNA3 GPU owner will feel cheated as their card got much less raster performance than they originally thought.,Neutral
AMD,Are you for real? Nvidia just did the exact opposite.,Neutral
AMD,You go one generation after that and the 20 series has full DLSS support...,Neutral
AMD,"that was a hardware limitation though, in amd's case that isn't it, it's purely choice..",Neutral
AMD,"Same, I see no issue. No DLSS on my gt 210 either.",Negative
AMD,It would be like Nvidia not releasing DLSS whichever version on the 1080 despite there being proof that they have a working implementation,Neutral
AMD,"You can already do it yourself with code that AMD themselves leaked with a simple file swap.   It works, everyone knows it works, and they still won’t officially support it because they’re gatekeeping it to 9000 series  Meanwhile you can use DLSS 4.5 all the way back to 2000 series, even if the performance hit is high, they at least give the option.",Negative
AMD,Don't bother with nuance in this subreddit. Only outrage is allowed.,Negative
AMD,"The official explanation is that they can't update int 8 fsr4.  Because the integer 8 bit math itself is limiting. Which does not really make sense because all models will be abandoned eventually.  Personally i find this upscaling debacle pretentious. Either ___ or these people severely hate these taa based methods but just are not saying that.  If a 7600 is running a game at 1080p 60fps. Then by lowering to quality upscale (720p) you'd typically get to 80fps right? Well with this model, it would be heavy enough that you'd just be dropping to 720p 60fps upscale. So at the end you'd just be getting a similar image quality if not worse in some ways.  But muh dlss 4.5. Yeah well a rtx 2070 is running things at 1080p 30fps. So ok.",Negative
AMD,Nvidia has made their premium pricing worth it by offering support 8 years down the line. I'm not going to buy another Radeon if my 9070XT doesn't get future FSR updates.,Neutral
AMD,"We literally have precedent for this with zen 3 support on older chipsets, but go off. There was something more recently with support for older radeon cards but that didn't seem nearly as clear cut to me at a glance.",Neutral
AMD,yes they think that will happen.....,Neutral
AMD,"Yes with enough backlash, look what happened with budlight. People like you with ignorant thinking is why change won’t happen.",Negative
AMD,RDNA4 9070XT has ~800Tops int8 and 1500Tops FP4. There’s no reason to not allow it to run next gen FSR/Ray regeneration.  7900XTX only has 123Tops and it’s a hardware limitation.,Negative
AMD,Thing is what would you buy as an alternative right now? The 5070ti is going away leaving a kneecapped 5070 and an overpriced-even-considering 5080.,Neutral
AMD,"I got a 9070.... it my first amd gpu and if they pull that, it will also be much last... i do understand locking something to entice the newer gen, but if its somrthing fundamental, then I am out",Neutral
AMD,I dont see how you can hate NVIDIA any more than hating AMD. Yall ate up the trashy tech youtuber hate. They are both corporations. They both want to make money. You're better off hating how grocery prices have doubled in a year than worrying about luxury items.,Negative
AMD,"I'm with you in that this is shitty by AMD, but let's be real. Your card will not be ""obsolete"" in 2 years if you're willing to lower some settings, or just use 3.1. You won't have the fanciest software, but you will more than likely still be able to have a good gaming experience. This idea that we must always upgrade is why GPU manufacturers are winning.",Neutral
AMD,"But WHERE TO? at least they have open source drivers RADV, and you can adapt fsr4 on it...",Neutral
AMD,"Technically that also happened with Nvidia with the 40 series getting frame gen which wasn't provided to the 30 and 20 series.  FSR frame gen worked on those older cards as well, DLSS frame gen was simply locked to the newest generation.  Multi frame gen was also locked to the 50 series.  I'm not exactly sad about it personally, I genuinely don't care for frame gen myself, but that is an example of Nvidia pulling similar bullshit.  I say this as an Nvidia owner, the grass isn't exactly much greener over here, but at the very least, the newer DLSS models aren't being arbitrarily restricted, and ray regeneration was also given to all RTX cards.  I'll probably always stick with Nvidia after some really consistently bad experiences (personally) with AMD, but I would rather people make their own decisions from a more educated point of view.  This particular problem isn't currently exclusive to AMD.",Neutral
AMD,If I remember correctly Nvidia also did not bring all features to past generations.,Neutral

AMD,The market already spoke with 95% buying NVIDIA and yet thse subreddits are full of either haters or AMD fanboys and its wild how they complain about their own decisions.,Negative
AMD,Are you sure? I thought it only supported INT4 not FP4.,Neutral
AMD,"My 2 reasons is that AMD works better on Linux than NVIDIA does, and AMD hasn’t  mandated the 12vhpwr cable that NVIDIA has. And FSR 4 is significantly better than previous FSR versions (which makes them NOT releasing int8 FSR 4 even worse).",Positive
AMD,They both suck tbh,Negative

AMD,You are not right.,Neutral
AMD,"I'm honestly not sure. It's probably a skill issue on my end but it's been giving ""display driver"" crash as listed by both Ark and Overwatch (and other games where it just closes the application without a pop-up nor bringing up Adrenaline.) I need to check what the exact error was when I get home. I'll investigate my ram (hope not 😭😭) and stuff too.   I've tried a clean install, both the newest (which it was already on) and some older drivers, hard resetting everything, turning off the secondary monitor and so on. It's just weird and infuriating when I only now got this issue and didn't have any for a year.  I did recently receive the warranty replacement for my QD-OLED and it was an updated model that does 280hz instead of 240hz. I mean, it worked fine for two days and my computer behaved indifferently to it but I was wondering if that was making it pitch a fit alongside my other panel at 180hz. Changed them both to be even and lower and same display driver crash in any game including random stuff like Barony after 2-3 minutes of gameplay. It is a Sapphire unit so I do have a warranty if it comes to that still but come on lol.",Negative
AMD,"And people are still happy with their 1080 tis, but I'm dreading having to update to this or even last year's drivers.",Negative
AMD,"for me the biggest issue is the gpu settings in the adrenaline software constantly resetting. It shouldnt be much of an issue, except the factory fan curve and power settings on my 7900xt makes it loud as a jet engine and gives it bad coil whine. Small tweaks to the settings and its fairly quiet and coilwhine isnt an issue, all at such a small loss in fps that i cant even notice. Atleast until next week when it randomly resets....",Negative
AMD,There's a reason an entire dedicated subreddit is needed to filter out all the AMD troubleshooting...,Neutral
AMD,"Same thing when people talk about gaming on Linux.  It's always ""well it worked with just a little tinkering""  Uh huh.",Neutral

AMD,"nvidia works fine for me on wayland with a 3070, on the 590 drivers. the only issue for me is the vkd3d performance loss which will be fixed in a couple months",Positive
AMD,"It's also worth noting that they already developed the int 8 version and that it works quite well, but amd refuses to officially release it. Making it considerably harder to use than it would have to be.",Negative
AMD,"This is wrong... It's about upscaling, not fg... And with taa the way it is, fsr4 and dlss output better picture then native taa",Negative
AMD,"funny you say that.  the 1080ti can do raytracing.  It's fucking *terrible* at it, but it can.",Negative
AMD,"AMD does not have a working implementation at the moment. They have some proof of concept beta software. We know an Implementation of the FSR4 model is gonna be available on the PS5 Pro next month and it's possible that this is gonna be much more advanced and more polished than what was already released by accident.    We are gonna have time to criticize the Radeon division once that is officially released and they still claim that it's not possible, but as of now I just don't see the big scandal.",Neutral
AMD,"I like the edit mentioning NVIDIA, the company that explicitly blocked users from employing heterogenous PhysX setups because it let people buy ATi GPUs (which were substantially faster) and pair them with a cheap NVIDIA GPU for PhysX, which they only needs to do because NVIDIA bought PhysX and immediately killed dedicated accelerators.  Note: it's not that they didn't support the setups, but rather they *blocked* an unsupported configuration that worked fine most of the time.  AMD not officially providing for and supporting a feature that *may or may not* actually work well enough to be officially viable is not the same thing. Given that it IS so easy to do on your own, surely it's not that big a deal, right?  The opinions of a bunch of people who have never done a bit of software development or validation in their lives don't really carry a lot of weight either way.",Negative
AMD,"There's a reason ""it works on my machine"" is a meme.",Neutral
AMD,Well the int8 version they did make runs only a couple % worse than fsr3 and still has a significant uplift over native. The only reason they are not releasing it is greed,Negative
AMD,I think it'd just be both flat out stupid and malicious at this point if they don't push some version of FSR4 to the older architectures. I saw some in the sister sub reddit say they'd give them till end of spring/summer to fix this glaring misstep. I do think they're working on a solution that they want to be near perfect before release or that it's just later in the pipeline while they push out other features but AMD being abominable with communication doesn't help anyone.,Negative
AMD,"Besides price, why would you buy AMD ever lol.",Negative
AMD,OH NO! Anyways....,Neutral
AMD,"If it was only up to strict hardware limitations, then maybe.  But the leaked implementation and unofficial versions of FSR 4 run quite well on older cards, so clearly they do not require a strict hardware limitation to withold support.  Meanwhile Nvidia released DLSS 4.5 even to GPUs that don't have the hardware to run it well as an option. I'm not sure to what extent their decisions on MFG and variable FG are driven by legitimate technical reasons, but the fact that they have released upscaling for all suitable cards and even written an emulation layer for 32-bit CUDA to restore old versions of PhysX makes me more inclined to believe that their reason is legit compared to AMDs clearly anti-customer behaviour regarding FSR.",Neutral
AMD,Forced sales of new cards is the only reason they need,Neutral
AMD,Where is the resource for this info? Im curious,Neutral
AMD,Isn't the 7900XTX supposed to have support for dual issue? Some website benchmarked it and it only works in extremely specific scenarios. 9070xt doesnt have dual issue meanwhile all nvidia gpus from ampere onwards have dual issue which only regresses in specific games.  I'd much rather they went back to the drawing board to enable dual issue atleast for FSR4 Int8. But its probably cheaper to can consumers and chase AI.,Negative
AMD,Lol yep that's the issue we're caught between a rock and a hard place. For now I got my 9070xt so I don't plan on buying anything but next gen or when I upgrade if they pull this crap I'll buy Nvidia,Negative
AMD,Especially considering when they're already drastically behind the curve when it comes to fsr as it is. DLSS blows it out of the water every time and every new release widens that gap. Now they're locking new versions to only the latest most expensive and most out of stock hardware widening that gap even more. It's just dumb AMD has become complacent which is going to cost them. They aren't top dog when it comes to GPUs. Hell they aren't even close.,Negative
AMD,The question is gonna be how the devs are gonna play it. A few games have already come out demanding fsr/DLSS like Indiana Jones then you got poorly optimized slop like borderlands 4 which is becoming more and more common. I hope developers will start optimizing but I've hoped for alot from devs in the past they failed to bother with,Negative
AMD,"Crazy what some people consider obsolete. There will be people buying a 9070xt in 3 years and be so stoked about their performance improvement. Everything is relative of course, but obsolete in a generation for higher tier cards is nonsense.",Negative

AMD,"It has less raw horsepower than a 5080 and there have already been several titles this year that are brutal to run without leaning on the software suite.  Yeah you can probably run 60fps native most of the time but, call me crazy, a $900 flagship card being limited to 60fps isn't good at all.  You'd literally be better off with the 9070xt than an XTX at this point, and it's just going to get worse for new releases as time marches on.",Negative

AMD,"I thought my card was failing and had it RMA'd, but it turns out the recent Radeon drivers over the past year are buggy (the longer my system is running, the more often the GPU crashes in things like Chrome).

AMD,Literally the biggest reason and I say it in the post. My 9070XT was $200 cheaper than the next available 5070Ti at the time and I needed the upgrade. Then I was able to get RAM and another SSD with the $200 before the price explosions.,Neutral
AMD,Because the 5070 Ti is $200+ more than the 9070 XT for barely any more performance.,Negative

AMD,AMD have official data sheet for these products.,Neutral
AMD,Yes and 123Tops is already including dual issue.  ML workload usually can utilize wave64 so dual issue is valid here.  if I remembered correctly Turing and before is alternate clock “half-issue” and GeForce ampere is the first recent NVIDIA architecture that is actually single issue.  I could be wrong here as I haven’t check the data sheet recently.,Neutral

Unless we've got some leaked internal memos saying that they're only doing this for commercial reasons (and the existence of the project in the first place would go counter to that supposition), I just don't think it's likely that it works as well and as universally as people with no experience in software development assume.",Negative

AMD,"Even if it was work in progress it was still miles better than what we have now with fsr 3. I don't see any reason other than greed for why they couldn't have released it in the current state and than slowly updated it over time if they though they could make it better.   PS5 archetecture is a bit different than desktop GPUs. They don't really have traditional NPU, and do fp8 with rdna 2 shaders iirc. So the INT8 version has nothing to do with upscaling on PS5 pro",Positive

AMD,My daughter is gaming on my old vega 56 and I guarantee is enjoying her games more than nearly everyone with a 5090.

I'm trying not to fall into that trap myself.,Negative
AMD,"I can't imagine buying a car for some software feature. Cars are mechanical to me, not digital, but I'm old school. So maybe that's where I kind of disconnect by not seeing things like FSR as the primary selling point of GPUs. I don't use FSR so I just don't care.  But I can see why it would matter to people that do want FSR. Of course I'd agree that every company should be bringing every feature they can to all consumers regardless of whether it's something I personally care about or not.  But this is about obsolescence. My 7800XT isn't obsolete because it doesn't support FSR4 natively via Radeon Settings which I don't even have installed. My 7800 XT won't be obsolete in 2028 either.",Negative
AMD,"I know about it and it works, but opti is not allowed if game is online, so can't use it in BF6 or Marvel Rivals (my two main games atm).",Negative
AMD,"The point of mentioning the 5080 wasn't that it should outperform it, but that it's not far behind my card so I can give my hands on experience by comparison.  I apologize if it sounded like it was meant to be derisive or mean spirited.  There are already titles releasing that even 120-144fps without upscaling or FG is a pretty big ask and I see the industry trending towards more of that personally.  That's just an unacceptable ceiling for a card as recent and expensive as the XTX in my opinion, with absolutely no shade at the owners that (in my opinion) got totally shafted.",Neutral
AMD,It (7900xtx) does 26fps in Doom TDA at 1080p.,Neutral
AMD,"Well I guess this boils down to me not feeling trapped by windows/microsoft. My rig at the time already met the pretty basic windows 11 hardware requirements (just had to change the partition style on the SSD), so it wasn’t a big deal.   On the other hand i would feel trapped by Linux… due to sub standard driver support that would dictate my hardware choices and fundamental compatibility issues that’ll prevent me from play certain games.  At the end of the day I don’t want Linux on a personal device. I work in tech and I have enough technical issues to solve at work that I don’t want to bring that part of my life to my hobbies. Plus what do you if/when the distro you use just dies and stops receiving updates? Happened to me when centoOS died and I had to migrate a few VMs to rocky. The only reason I’m using Linux here is because it’s free and Microsoft’s licensing for windows VMs is batshit crazy for high core count configurations.   I just want my PC to work with the least amount of tinkering involved. I honestly barely interact with windows beyond logging in and launching a game. My personal devices are mostly Apple (iPhone, Mac, iPad, etc) because they just work.",Neutral
AMD,"My screen would freeze up, then flash, then would get a notification from AMD drivers that the GPU crashed.  I only realized it was the drivers when I was on a RX5600 while my card was being RMA'd since the RX5600 was doing the same thing.  Replacement card still behaved the same. I installed driver version 23.1.1 and have not had a single driver crash since.  Nothing was running in the background so I ruled out a memory leak.",Negative
AMD,"The only benefit is the vram, which is good for me, I started with 4GB way way back for my first “serious” GPU and less than a few months later doom 2016 gave me a gut punch locking nightmare settings just beyond 4gb.   Looking at GPUs these days I hope 16gb keeps my head above longer than 4GB did in 2015, I won’t be doing any 120fps gaming without lowering resolution or max graphics but I’m pretty comfy here at 4k and 60fps on my cheap tv.   The penalty was spending a couple months getting things that worked fine on Nvidia to work with AMD. Not to mention Ryzen Master still doesn’t work and the best advice to fix that is…hey don’t bother with ryzen master it sucks just use your non-existent 300 dollar motherboard bios software.",Positive

AMD,"Nope, you're just a shill.",Negative
AMD,I remember not even a year ago people were absolutely hating on the idea of FSR and DLSS and now they get upset that AMD doesn't release a half baked Beta version of it?     I can only base this on the leaker KeplerL2 who claimed that the PS5 Pro doesn't have hardware FP8. The fact that it took them almost 2 years to port it over heavily implies that there is at least some trickery involved with getting the FSR4 technology up and running on the PS5 Pro. If that person was right that would fit very well with the leaked INT8 FSR4.,Negative

Again, the card will be 4 years old this year. Obviously 900$ is a lot but you still don't need upscaling in any way to play all new releases at high FPS so I think I got my moneys worth.   Still no idea why AMD does not release FSR 4, but all those people who are acting like you cannot play current titles on the XTX just make me roll my eyes.",Neutral
AMD,Do you have Multi-Plane Overlay enabled or disabled? Using Display Calibration profiles?,Neutral
AMD,"Why would battlefield add latency with upscaling? Are you talking about frame generation? Those are two different things... One is upscaling, the other one is creating ""fake frames""...",Negative
AMD,"Negative compare to native, due to reduced render resolution.  DLSS 4.5 performance mode looks much better than native while pumping almost double the fps with half the render pipeline latency.",Positive
AMD,"They mean the latency is lower because fps is higher.  We're at a point where upscaling with DLSS is better than native, so if you aren't playing with MORE fps and lower latency using upscaling, you're stupid lol.",Neutral
AMD,Does it take work to be this dumb or is something that a beginner can pick up quickly?,Negative
AMD,"Most people I know love dlss and use it in most games. Most people are framerate > graphics and dlss is usually a very small hit to graphics for nice framerate improvement. And if you look at the coverage of dlss from the media it's mostly positive.   From what I remember the PS5 Pro has neither hardware fp8 nor int8, and if that's the case the INT8 version of fsr 4 (which again is done, it works and is better in basically every case than the current version by a large margin, so it's definitely not half baked) has nothing to do with PS5 pro getting fsr 4.",Positive
AMD,"Native with current generation games usually has some form of forced TAA, which is what you consider to be that shimmery artifact shit.  DLSS/FSR/XeSS override that TAA as they are a form of TAA in and of themselves, and are generally preferable to native TAA in both picture quality as well as performance. Running these at the highest quality setting will typically minimize or eliminate that shimmery artifact shit that you hate so much.   On top of that, DLAA is just one of the best super samplers, arguably better than MSAA was.  It's only unfortunate that we can't have a proper 1 to 1 comparison with it in the extreme vast majority of games since MSAA isn't really supported in a lot of modern game engines anymore after a shift to deferred rendering techniques.",Negative
AMD,Native is a shimmer mess today. You need to update your general knowledge of computer graphics.,Neutral
AMD,It’s not like it cannot run games. The issue here is a 7900XTX runs worse than a 9070 or a 4070.  With DLSS 4.5 a 5060Ti may outperform 7900XTX with even better image quality level. DLSS preset M performance mode looks much better than FSR 3.1 native AA. And that is the performance gap 7900XTX is facing.  9070 at least have a usable FSR4 that doesn’t kill performance like the int8 variant.,Negative
AMD,Doesn’t upscaling introduce like a ms or 2 of lag?  And yea im talking more about FG rather than upscaling my bad.  Ai has a very bad taste in everyone’s mouth. The superbowl commercials are ruined.,Negative
AMD,And 4.5 is just upscaling not FG…?,Neutral
AMD,You tell me,Neutral
AMD,"From what I found it seems like most sources agree that the PS5 Pro has INT8 as it uses a mix of RDNA2, RDNA3 and possibly even some RDNA4 features. Even in the reveal Sony was boasting how their GPU had all these advanced features that were lacking from Radeon PC cards. Sony would never accept RDNA3 getting FSR4 before the PS5 Pro.",Neutral
AMD,"> highest quality  Which is how performance tanks hard when you don't have the hardware on the card to run the sampling algorithms *natively*, ironically.  Man, fsr3 must be really, really that fucking godawful if you would all prefer bad 'quality' framerates or blurry ""performance"" visuals from a macgyver'd fsr4 retrofit.",Negative
AMD,>The issue here is a 7900XTX runs worse than a 9070 or a 4070.  lol wat,Negative
AMD,"Yes, it does add ms or 2 of lag, but your framerate improves which negates that...  Think of it like this: 60fps is 16.6ms frametime, if you enable upscle and then you get let's say 10ms frametime (don't know gow much fps is that), and then upscale adds 1ms, in total you are at 11ms vs 16.6 you had before that. That is how it improves latency.  And it can do all that, and give you a better picture then native  Agree with you on fg, it is good sometimes, and in some games, and definitely not in multiplayer games :)",Positive
AMD,"DLSS 4.5 have both updated but the FG part is not released yet. I’m only referring to the SR part of it here.  Obviously you will get ~1 frame of latency for FG. But that is not true for SR.  You get 1-2ms latency for SR but since enabling SR will reduce the render resolution you actually save 5-10ms there, resulting in a latency decrease.",Neutral
AMD,"It's possible I remembered it wrong.   But I doubt sony would care if amd released fsr4 for rdna 3 before they did, but even if they did they can't really force amd to make their products worse",Negative
AMD,"Man, if only the user could *choose* that for themselves.  It sure would be unfortunate if a competitor went that route, giving their customers the ability to decide if they prefer a lower quality but better performing model or a higher quality but worse performing model.

AMD,"https://files.catbox.moe/2ufdux.png  Plus if you want to use upscaling to improve GPU performance, the 9070 and 4070 have far superior options to the 7900xtx so they pull further ahead in performance & image quality.",Positive
AMD,"Just think about it this way: FSR4 performance mode looks much better than FSR3.1 quality mode.  So we should at least compare 7900XTX quality mode with 9070 performance mode.  Or add FSR4 int8 to the mix:  We should compare 7900XTX balanced FSR4 int8 with 9070 FSR4 performance mode.   9070/XT user can enjoy a much cleaner less ghosting FSR4 with ease, while 7900XTX struggles to get a decent image quality.  Lacking of ML matrix performance is hurting 7900XTX a lot.",Neutral
AMD,"i dont know spanish but what i could understand by the layout is:   1. Your effective clock is behind your core clock by around 513Mhz which is essentially ""stretching"", its not actually running at that speed since your PPT is demanding more usage but it cant so you might raise it to 105W   2. Your core 0 and 2 are best cores and they are very aggressively CO'd so try increasing the value, core 0 at 10 and core 2 at 15, they need more power.   3. Temps could be set at a 95C thermal throttle limit manually if you want.   4.

AMD,"Certainly this year with its ridiculous high prices would be a massive show of good will to AMD fans.   Hopefully Valve is pushing on them at a higher level as it would greatly help Machine that is on RDNA 3, this also could be a reason to have not released yet as Valve has worked very closely with AMD and with their push to Linux OS and by extension AMD hardware... so maybe they are releasing Int8 with Machine to show solidarity with Valve?",Positive
AMD,"FSR4 is much slower than previous versions, especially without full hardware acceleration. Upscaling tech is literally only for squeezing higher framerates out of cards. Although I understand wanting features supported on old cards, porting FSR4 to older hardware is unlikely to achieve the one thing it needs to do; allow the card to render games at acceptable framerates by upscaling.",Negative

AMD,"Pressure them, to release this... also pretty sure they don't care until they are selling all to AI.",Negative
AMD,"Haven't watched the video, but in AMD's defense. Smaller native floating point makes such a big difference in performance, quality and such a different beast to tune that it doesn't really make sense for AMD to invest in FSR yet.  FSR4 requires FP8, which is only natively supported by RDNA4. Nvidia already showed that FP4 gives you double the ai performance for visually the same quality as FP8. From a technical stance, the a lot of work the software radeon team will have to tune FP8 FSR4 will have to be redone whenever Radeon supports FP4 natively.  While it sucks that we don't get FSR4 on rdna 2 or 3, AMD themselves aren't willing to place a dead-end int8 version under the same label as their current stepping stone. Integer and floating point are different enough that optimizations in 1 don't translate to the other a lot of the time.  They also have to communicate with the hardware team to decide what is and isn't a viable development route. Tensor cores are essential for running transformer based upscaling. The hardware team not developing tensor cores held radeon back from developing transformer based FSR (FSR4) sooner. While Nvidia put tensor cores in their gpus since 2018 RTX. AMD only started with 2025 RDNA4, so AMD is playing 7 years of catch up. Even the first Intel Arc cards from 2022 had tensor cores.",Neutral

I am never buying AMD ever again! This is the kind of practices why I haven't been buying Nvidea or Intel, locking out features that we all know are possible on hardware that is one generation behind instead of at least introducing it as an experimental feature or part of beta driver shows how much this company that was relatively consumer friendly went from you can flash a higher tier or even next gen GPU bios and keep the same Mobo platform with AM4 from 1700x to 5800x3d to the same anti consumer crap the other teams are doing, and since the other teams have better features and support AMD lost the one reason why I keep coming back to them.

AMD,I would buy a 9070 XT only if AMD would release FSR4 for my 7700XT.,Neutral
AMD,"It is probably because FSR 4 upscaling is worse on older models since they lack the AI cores to run it right. AMD is probably worried about people using the 7000 series cards in comparison videos.  You can see the Int8 version is a lot softer and lacks a lot of the sharpness and detail you get in the FP8 version. HUB also didn't include FPS numbers. I suspect the performance hit is notable.  Not a very smart move, but can I see why they might do it.",Negative
AMD,"I think the problem is that, the INT8 version of FSR4 is technically worse than the FP8 version, AMD can't release the INT8 version legally (otherwise that would be classified as false advertising).  They should either call it FSR 3.9 or something, or just make it open source permanently",Negative
AMD,It's not exclusive to just AMD. Nvidia and even Intel are bugging out and selling higher. They are only aiming at the high VRAM units because they can't supply that unit until the market levels off. Any other company that had plans is now probably going to spend the next two years waiting on AI to make a profit before they shell out a new model and more than likely they are going to cater to the budget market because the market will be flooded with memory wafers.,Neutral

AMD,so much repost spam of this,Negative
AMD,"I think Tim is missing the point a little here. AMD has opted (finally, and rightfully) to follow Nvidias example where it comes to their perception in the market.   Let me elaborate. Nvidia releases a software feature that doesn't work on the previous generation of GPU’s. Why do they do this? Is it because it simply wouldn’t work? Or because they just want to screw their customers with older cards? Or because they want to encourage sales of the new GPU? Maybe all 3, who knows.   But one reason that I find is often overlooked is that Nvidia knows and cares tremendously about brand perception. They learned that with the first version of DLSS. They were a laughing stock for a year because of how shit it was.  So Nvidia will not put out software for GPU’s unless it meets a certain quality standard. Now look at DLSS. The brand perception is so well regarded because they lock it down to only the cards it works well on.  To circle back, I think this is exactly what AMD has finally learned. They've been dogged and trashed for years because of their shoddy software features, and now they’re taking a page out of Nvidias book.   Yes Int8 FSR 4 could work on older cards, but it would muddy the waters of brand perception. RDNA3 and RDNA2 users would think it’s ok, whereas RDNA4 users would have a much better experience. Thus leading to inconsistent messaging from users, and the word of mouth effect is dramatically weakened.",Negative

Thing is, the INT8 version doesn't really need to be better than the FP8 version. It already completely outclasses FSR3 + XeSS and comes close to FP8 - this is definitely good enough.

And even Nvidia isn't clear from driver issues either. Its just the nature when there are thousands of combinations of GPUs, CPUs, monitors, and applications to run.

I've found HU to be pretty objective and fair, they call anti-consumer bull$hit when they see it, whether it comes from Intel, nVidia, or AMD. Maybe not as abrasively as Gamer's Nexus, but not very far off in egregious cases (like this one).  My biggest criticism of HU is that I think they're softer on nVidia than they should be, but I also think that about most big tech reviewers.",Negative

That price was already increased though because it was less during October which prompted me to upgrade before the price increased further.  Bettet investment compared to what though?  I think it is a good investment for 4-5 years. It'll have shown its age by then though with the way games have become more demanding. You'll have to lower some settings but hopefully not too much with DLSS.  You will still be able to use it. I'm just worried about how games have become more demanding and/or less optimized these days. Worried it'll be way more demanding in the future but hoping not because the current level of graphics are already insane to me.  For reselling I think it'll fare better than the 5060 Ti 16GB and the 5070 12GB because it has the performance and the VRAM but we will see what the next gen is capable of. Maybe it's way more power efficient and/or better in performance like the leap from 2000 series to 3000 series. We don't know. Maybe 6060 Ti will be near in performance but with better Upscaling and Frame Gen capability? Maybe not.  Upscaling and Frame Gen is here to stay and the improvements have been insane so I think the card's capability to use it properly will also be considered.  Maybe NVIDIA pulls another DLSS 4.5 level of quality increase in some way or magically improves latency that can only be utilized by the next gen.",Neutral

This is what led Linus to use a 7900 XTX over a 5090 in his updated personal system.   Then after the 9xxxx series launched, they were initially undercutting NVIDIA by ~$150-200 dollars. This was temporarily unavailable, but as recently as December you could get a 9070 xt for under MSRP, while most every 5070ti/5080 was slightly over MSRP and a way worse value.

Like in theory a 7900XTX is roughly equal to a 9070XT/4080/5070Ti if they run the exact same settings but in practice it's really not because you can run much lower resolutions on those cards and still get better visual results.

No idea about the mobile range   “The same CPUs” are generally failed higher SCU products, everyone does this. Perfect example is memory that doesn’t hit certain markers gets sold as a lesser SKU (3200mhz vs 3600mhz DDR4); they don’t just throw away the product. Intel also does this, as do Nvidia.

Essentially, they're still shipping older architecture without modern FSR support and want people to keep buying it. If they said it was DOA, nobody would buy into it.",Negative
AMD,"As the owner of a laptop with a 6850m XT in it, my sad suspicion is that when AMD announced they were separating the driver development for RDNA 3 & 4 from the driver development for RDNA 1 & 2, and then had that whole kerfuffle ""maintenance mode""  which they then corrected to, RDNA 1 & 2 continuing to receive new game support. What it was really about is that AMD is only planning on bringing the INT8 version of FSR4 to RDNA 3 and 3.5 based products and that the 6000 series GPU's are going to be left out in the cold.   I think Sony getting first crack at it has a lot more to do with the fact that they helped jointly create the code to run FS4 on older GPU's than the volume of SoC's they buy from AMD for their PlayStation division.

It would be unusual for AMD to include full CDNA2 throughputs (1024 ops in INT8 per CU), as that would require more transistors per CU and an expensive redesign of GPU masks billed to Sony. Semi-custom only goes so far (off-the-shelf designs that can be mixed and matched). This would border on fully custom.  It is capable of 288 TOPs in INT4, so where high precision isn't needed, like traversing through the CNN, INT4 could be used. INT8 can be used for the final frame accumulation stage to reduce errors (which can simply combine 2 INT4 outputs at high/low sides to create an equivalent INT8 data type). If that's how they're doing INT8, then yes, it's near 300 TOPs and pretty damn clever (on top of their VGPRs as VRAM custom firmware; most of AMD's GPU logic can be reprogrammed via firmware).",Neutral
AMD,"Mark Cerny did say it has special acceleration cores for RT and PSSR upscaling. And Digital Foundry made comparison and came to the conclusion that the closest GPU is the 9060XT, hence my comment.",Neutral
AMD,Are we sure? If that's the case then it shouldn't be able to do PSSR efficiently with the raster power it got. Also doesn't make sense why the base PS5 doesn't support PSSR.,Negative

AMD,"No shit Sherlock, it's not in the title though",Negative
AMD,"I never use upscaling for performance personally. I use upscaling in every possible game because actually running DLSS over native AA/TAA implementations looks literally better in virtually every title (at least from 1440p and up baseline, i think its a little worse from 1080p baseline). And its been like that easily since 3.x version.   On the other hand, theres almost no reason to not use DLSS 4.5 on quality vs native.",Neutral
AMD,I absolutely agree that AMD's lack of support for previous-gen products is unacceptable. But it's not a matter of the time commitment to watch the video. I'd gladly watch a 30-minute deep-dive on the topic by a creator who respects his or her audience by using descriptive titles.  Video content should deliver value by presenting a thoughtfully-researched analysis of a topic that can't otherwise be communicated by a handful of sentences of text. Not by gatekeeping information behind an ambiguous title.,Negative

Overall, I don't care for RT, Upscaling, Frame Gen or going beyond 1440p. If a game runs shit to look decent at 1440p on a 7900XTX, it's very likely not my GPUs fault but a incompetent studio unable to optimize. RT is a choice, while Upscaling and FG has become a crutch for many.

AMD,"If FG feels that bad for you then you should definitely be setting your flip queue to zero/immediate since every queued frame adds that much latency. FG done correctly adds a bit over one half of one frame of latency but you get almost double fps, while queue 1 usually only adds like 20-30% more frames with worse latency. Better off in terms of latency and smoothness using zero queue plus FG in any games that let you change it compared to queue 1 (god forbid if the default is 2 or 3 frames).  But yeah playing with a fat queue and then adding FG on top from anything but like 120fps base feels pretty bad",Negative

FSR Quality does keep it closer to 60fps but even then it still drops under.  It's not like the entire game runs like that but there are quite a few areas that do unfortunately, just is what it is.

AMD,"Two different guys you're arguing with. I'm the guy you're quoting but not the guy whose been replying after that.  I bought their products because they were competitive on Raster starting with the 5700xt and 6900xt and I could look past fsr and RT performance for a while longer on a 7900 xtx.  But I was not willing to grab a 9070xt just for finally tolerable fsr, and instead grabbed a 5090 for a real upgrade during the period where they could be had for near msrp.  I now have zero reason to ever go back to an amd gpu since they will always be behind the curve and it's unlikely that they'll actually put out a card that competes with the 5090 within the next 2 or 3 years.",Neutral
AMD,"Nvidia launched some new features that had little traction and no demand, that older hardware couldn't do.   AMD 5-6 years after DLSS2.0 launched decided MAYBE just maybe people do care about upscaling, while having a decent version be locked solely to their latest arch.

AMD,Especially considering they just announced a new version of the current strix halo with less cpu cores for that exact reason.,Neutral
AMD,"The CPU core chiplets are small & relatively inexpensive compared to the iGPU & i/o die.  If you look at Strix Halo, the 8 core chiplets are only \~70mm2 each, compared to 307mm2 for the iGPU and i/o stuff.  Adding a second chiplet costs AMD very little, but lets them sell it as a much higher margin product (or at least AMD thinks they will be able to get that extra margin, they have backtracked a bit, at least announcing an 8 core product with the full iGPU).    With Zen 6 AMD plans on making 12 core CPU chiplet (on a newer, more dense fab process than current chips) that will also be a small, 70 something mm2 chip.  They plan on using those same chiplets in server, desktop, and mobile products.  So for Medusa Halo the only logical CPU counts are 12 & 24, maybe 20/16 if they use two chiplets cut down to 10/8 cores each.    Do note that currently the 8 core chiplets going into Strix Halo are different than the 8 core ones going into current desktops & servers; Strix Halo is the testbed for AMD's new interconnect tech, and that is part of why Strix Halo has been so expensive.  Hopefully with many more Zen 6 products using the same sort of 12 core chiplets and interconnect tech it will help with prices.",Neutral

AMD,"I have fond memories of the Kaveri APUs. Neither the CPU or GPU were particularly fast but the design was versatile. You could choose to put most of the power budget into the CPU or GPU, depending on the task.  I don't have that kind of time to experiment or tune anymore but it was fun back then.",Positive
AMD,"yeah last time I looked into laptops in the 11th gen era I concluded that for 99% of people an i3 would be plenty  and for mid-tier gaming there's zero benefit from more than 8 cores right now  the problem of laptops is they are always RAM-starved (unless you can customise it or add more yourself) so that they become unusable long before the hardware itself does, it's a massive scam, especially for big companies buying in bulk  a 2nd gen i3 is still useable for lightweight stuff if you replace its 2 or 4 Gb with 12 or 16",Negative
AMD,That's why only halo got a larger GPU.  That 256bit bus was not cheap to build.,Negative
AMD,"As I told you before, there's no way AMD will launch in the same year, 2027 - Medusa Point, Medusa Halo, Desktop GPUs, PS6, XBOX and probably the rumoured PS and XBOX handhelds. It's a mammoth task from engineering and marketing resources and it will take massive chunk of TSMC N3 wafer allocation. Not gonna happen.",Negative
AMD,There's Medusa Premium but that product isn't tailored towards a handheld and will cost a fortune. PS handheld will likely dominate. Maybe some low cost SoC later on as a successor to mendocino + GPU tile. TBH it's more likely Intel will have that first.,Neutral
AMD,"Optane still wouldn't be worth it IMO - it's like another level of cache between RAM and storage, but almost as expensive",Negative
AMD,"Same issue happened with the internet bubble.   Cisco was inflated as fuck because everyone was building internet infrastructure and then the bubble popped. Took 15 years for the infrastructure glut to be filled and companies to reinvest.  We has a massive amount of GPU and compute glut right now due to AI bubble. If the bubble pops and AI/compute demand goes down, there will be a massive amount of glut that will not be filled EVEN if AI becomes profitable and real in the near future.",Negative
AMD,I paid ~2400-2450 eur without VAT in Romania. I bought it at my company and VAT is deductible.,Negative
AMD,The z13 didn't have enough wattage. Newer systems and better drivers are showing numbers between 4060-4070 at lower total system power. DLSS and ray tracing are still in favor of the RTX dedicated graphics.,Neutral
AMD,"It's been proven to be able to match the 4060. Also from my own experience running it and also owning a PS5 Pro, it feels like matches a PS5 Pro even more. I can easily run most games at high details 1880p with FSR, granted without ray tracing from anywhere between 60-100fps. This laptop impressed me even as someone who has a 5090 9800x3d gaming rig. Even a 5050 laptop sacrifices portability too much and battery life would also be atrocious. I can play PS3 games for 3 hours on battery if I limit the FPS to 40 (to match the power efficient 40Hz refresh rate).",Positive
AMD,That'd be stupid. SHS showed the 7900 XTX as being the most popular card of RDNA 3 for AMD until the 7800 XT caught up.  And I remember rumors saying that MCM faced unknown issues that had caused them to not be released at all.,Negative
AMD,I guess it might because they know what’s coming next with RDNA5/UDNA and trying to avoid a 7900XTX case again.  They will never compete against 5090 due to lack of radiance core in RDNA4. People will expect decent path tracing performance for a top end GPU. So it’s better to build a value product that runs RT good enough.,Neutral
AMD,afaik they said they could have done a 3090 (or 4090?) competitor but it would have consumed a ridiculous 600w  the xtx at stock uses 355w,Negative
AMD,>I'm sure they know what each other have.  What is your source on this? Are you suggesting collusion?  >AMD was comparing their data centre stuff at CES to future Nvidia hardware that had zero third party performance data and not even officially unveiled until that same event.   AMD marketing isn't something to take seriously,Negative
AMD,Chips take years to design. Zen 1 took about 5 years from scratch board to tap out.  So back in 2021 AMD was not expecting AI will be this huge for a laptop and thought XDNA NPU was good enough.  Even they know others product this can never changed already. They just know they are screwed earlier than us.,Negative
AMD,"Yeah, but the first comment was explicitly talking about their big APU line up.",Neutral
AMD,"One of the big things for AI was the write-through endurance. Supposedly more than 50 DW per day, and with decently fast access times. I think Intel gave up because flash was outscaling in raw capacity and cost less. Lower write endurance with higher capacity was perfectly fine for servers, but AI does like to churn data and I can see how Optane would have been nice...if it was able to continue scaling.  Personally I wonder if it's like with SRAM getting completely outscaled by DRAM. It had some great traits but now is only used for a tiny cache pool in regular CPUs.  Optane is gone and memristors are not being used at scale as far as I know. We kinda need some efficiency breakthroughs again, this brute force approach is looking very expensive.",Neutral
AMD,"ok that makes sense, thank you.",Positive
AMD,"it doesn't scale much beyond 50W, Z13 can do 70W+; wattage is not the problem",Negative
AMD,"It can never match 4060, which can run DLSS 4.5 with ease. RDNA3.5 is a dead end now without proper matrix unit. 4060 with internal 720p can provide much better image quality than your 1880p render.  It got similar PP as Mac Studio which is way slower than RTX4060. So kinda useless for a local LLM deployment.  For local fine tuning/training I recommend a Spark as that is only couple hundred dollars more and got you 10x better PP with a 200Gbps NIC.",Negative
AMD,MCM wasn’t as cheap as originally planned. That’s why the new “value option”becomes monolithic again.,Neutral
AMD,">They will never compete against 5090 due to lack of radiance core in RDNA4.  I agree with you. On the surface, RDNA 4 does really well at RT now, and FSR4 is easily into ""good enough"" territory for upscaling (as in, better than when people started saying that about DLSS), but when you get results like [this in Alan Wake 2](https://www.techspot.com/articles-info/2961/bench/RT-AW2.png), or [this in Indiana Jones](https://www.techspot.com/articles-info/2961/bench/RT-Indiana-p.webp), it becomes pretty clear that RDNA 4 is not the end of the line for AMD reaching parity with Nvidia's RT performance. Those aren't ""unoptimized"" games; that is AMDs RT solution being insufficient for next gen PTGI. If AMD released a 1500+ dollar card that got beat by generation old, *non-flagship* cards, they would have been (rightfully) destroyed in reviews. I think the 7900XTX in 2023 was the last chance AMD had to release a flagship GPU while (mostly) escaping criticism on that front.  I'd have loved to see it, because it would have been super cool, but I think AMD dodged a bullet by keeping it in the lab. Having no MCM consumer GPUs probably helped simplify driver development a lot too.",Neutral
AMD,The 6900 and 6950 XT were competitors to the 3090 at 1080 and 1440P. They got a bit behind at 4K.  The 7950 XTX according to some leaked engineering samples was a 4090 competitor but was canned due to the ridiculous power requirements and such.,Neutral
AMD,The NPU isn’t the weak part of their mobile APU. They already have 50-60tops.,Neutral
AMD,"> I think Intel gave up because flash was outscaling in raw capacity and cost less.  Intel had massive quality issues too. They mainly made it available as a service for rent, because then they could replace the Optane sticks without anyone noticing. At some point they just gave up, because it would never become profitable.",Negative
AMD,We still make tremendous use of SRAM - X3D is the poster child for SRAM.,Neutral
AMD,Optane still wouldn't have been good for AI because it was slow as hell compared to DDR and HBM. The 256GiB DIMMs could only do about 5GB/s read and 1GB/s write according to Intel. The HBM modules that are used by AI processors can do 2TB/s per module.,Negative
AMD,"I just looked at Notebookcheck again and a Geekom mini PC over 100W got up to 15-20% faster than a z13 running in turbo, it looks like. It depends on graphics quality and how much multicore load is on the CPU.  That's enough to go from about a 4060 up into the 4070 range, depending on the game. But as I said, DLSS still shifts things into favor of the 4070 overall.",Neutral
AMD,Reaching parity with 50 series is a very low target. AMD could easily do better than that at iso-raster.  There seems to be strong indications that they are going all out with RDNA 5 on PT. It'll be interesting to see what kind of gains we'll see.,Positive
AMD,The NPU isn’t weak compared to other NPUs. It just isn’t strong enough for LLM and other complex ML workloads. It’s good enough for camera framing and mic noise cancellation but nobody thought we would want it to run image or even video generation today.,Negative
AMD,"I can buy into this, Intel blew a lot of money trying force technologies onto the market before. The phase-changing solids were amazing to see in a real product (optane used cells that shift between amorphous and crystalline), but I can believe it was difficult to keep making them smaller and closer together.",Positive
AMD,"Hundreds of megs, not hundreds of gigs. That's how much DRAM has outscaled SRAM. This is why IBM developed space-saving, vertically oriented eDRAM to improve cache capacities. I am wondering if Optane was hitting a similar wall and that's why yields were falling on the last chips they made.",Neutral
AMD,"I know; I've read some of your posts about the patents they've filed and whatnot (not that I necessarily understand everything). As far as I'm aware, Nvidia hasn't done much with their RT implementation w.r.t. the technology behind it since Ampere either, so it really would be a low bar. I'm extremely excited for whatever both companies are able to whip out of their ass next generation. I think people are going to be blown away.",Neutral
AMD,No consumer on die NPU is strong enough for LLM and “complex ML workloads” and that was never the intended use for them.   On die NPU is exclusively for offloading low power inference workload from the cpu and gpu. This is nothing specific to AMD.,Negative
AMD,I'm not sure that the DRAM to SRAM ratio has changed much...?,Neutral
AMD,"nice. I will admit my posts haven't been the most reader friendly xD. I'll try to do better in the future + what I recently discussed isn't close to the full picture and many more patents appear each quarter. This will become clear when I do the final push of patent post(s) right before the unveil by either Sony or AMD.  You're right. The underlying architecture is unchanged since Ampere basically.    \- Ampere did make RT and compute and ML + compute concurrent but other than that it was just fixed function for motion blur (3D professionals, not gaming) + 2X ray/tri intersections + 33% bigger L1/shared memory.   \- 40 series was the biggest leap in perf but mostly low hanging fruits. Supersized L2 makes a difference, frequency boost lowers cache latencies, otherwise it's mainly SER + OMM for Path tracing performance + the 2X ray/tri increase again.   \- 50 series is incremental, all it brings to the table is RTX MG HW compression and Linear swept spheres + 2X ray/tri increase again.  It's embarassing that a $500M company Imagination Technologies has a Ray tracing architecture that destroys AMD and NVIDIA in architectural sophistication. That's an idea of what we can expect if the big boys actually bother, but TBH with the money and talent NVIDIA has they could prob come up with something even better.  Agree. It will be the most competitive on the hardware front since the 2000s. People should not underestimate RDNA 5 and NVIDIA's next gen. NVIDIA will have to start really innovating again on hardware side to keep up. 60 series will be the most interesting since Turing and 10000 series will be the most interesting AMD architecture since GCN.  I saw AMD hired the former HW lead Imagination Technologies Mike Livesley back in 2021. Suspect he headed the development of RDNA 5's ray tracing Hardware. He's all over the most interesting ray tracing patents so I think we'll see a massive increase in ray traversal performance. It'll leapfrog 50 series a ton fs.   As for shading that's more tricky, but it should be at least at 50 series level at the same raster, but long term neural shading and work graphs API will increase that advantage a lot. The architecture also seems to be tailored for those paradigm shifts.",Neutral
AMD,A 96MB 8-core processor vs a 64GB DRAM module costing less than $250 before prices went crazy? SRAM is completely outscaled in storage capacity.,Negative
AMD,"See, it's actually a bit unclear to me how much of the patents will be in the next gen Radeon series. GPUs aren't easy to make and if I remember correctly the designs for next gen are finalized even before the current gen makes it to the consumer. That would mean either AMD has implemented those technologies before filing the patent. Or they're planning them for the generations after UDNA officially comes about.  Obviously, you know better than me. But I would ask. How early does a patent need to be filed (I know there's no real time limit here) for you to expect it to show up in actual hardware. I'm sure AMD and Nvidia have tons of patents they hold for technologies that never actually appeared in their GPUs.",Neutral

AMD,"Really stretching here. 9950X3Dv2 != 9950X3D2; 9950X3D version 2 can be anything, like improved frequency and cache CCDs, not unlike 9850X3D. It can still be a hybrid chip. Creating one 9950X3D2 will cost two 9850X3Ds in practice because really good CCDs don't just magically appear. There's a limited supply of very good bins.  Even if 9950X3D2 (the dual V-Cache one) exists, it's not for gamers. It'd be for parallel workloads that require cache and execution consistency. That'd be better under a Pro variant that offers enterprise security features for workstations or even under EPYC 4000-series that can combine higher frequencies and cache use in database operations that are hitting system RAM a bit harder than usual.  Gamers can't have everything.",Neutral

AMD,"Yes it is, for starters this is 2400x1506 and 8 gigs of vram isn't enough at 1080p in a lot of games. So this will not run in so many games instantly. Upscaling doesn't lower vram use much because it requries vram to run.  RT hzd and FG ghosts of tsushima which is a ps4 game from 2017 go over 8. They work perfectly fine on the 3060, but not the 4060. IIRC the 3060 gets like 150 FPS while the 4060 gets like 20 with FG on tsushima.  There's literally dozens of games that don't work on a 4060/5060 ti 8 gig that work fine on the 16.

If you can't comfortably hold at 1/2 arms distance for extended periods and are forced to prop it up on a table or brace your arms to play, it barely counts as a handheld. Either buy a lighter alternative handheld or realize you should be buying a 14"" gaming laptop with less compromises and better specs. At the ~30w TDP limit which is what a lot of handhelds target to extend battery life, the 8060S loses a ton of performance vs the 85w TDP limit.

I'm not going to be chasing specs when AMD still doesn't have an iGPU with full FSR4 support and the cheapest AYANEO Ryzen 395 model costs a little more than what I paid for my whole PC (not including peripherals).  $439 512GB/$519 1TB for the refurb OLED steam deck is plenty to get through a big chunk of backlogged casual games, platformers, and older stuff without feeling like I wasted my money, especially if I use it for >500hrs and sell it later to get back some of that value assuming a Steam Deck 2 OLED comes out. It is pretty much perfect for games like Bayonetta, Cuphead, Hollow Knight, Stardew Valley, Pizza Tower, Enter the Gungeon, Spyro, etc.",Negative
AMD,"Well... yeah. As well as people who want the best handheld. This can play cyberpunk at 100+ fps or comfortably with RT. Or run portal RTX at all, games over 8 gigs of VRAM. It has the performance of an RTX 4070m but w/o being gimped by 8 gigs of VRAM like the 4070m.

AMD,"Yeah if you want to actually check the performance increase of an overclocked 9800X3D you should run a 720p test or lower, but the thing is the vast majority of 9850X3D buyers are running their games at 1440p or higher on a 4080/90 5070 Ti/80/90 or AMD 7900 XTX / 9070 XT.",Neutral

AMD,"I mean I agree - I have no idea if my 9800X3D can handle the higher speeds as I'm content with it stock (still under the cheapest TR dual-tower I could find at MicroCenter, haven't gotten my custom loop built yet).  I think it's more just that these CPUs can reliably handle the speeds, whereas not all 9800X3D CPUs could.  Also still wondering about the memory controller, but I understand that that's an insensitive thing to ask about these days lol",Negative

AMD,"Mm. I started out with 1.5v. Ran that for a short while. Then 1.55v and a 120mm fan, hanging from the case with zipties. If voltage would have killed RAM instantly, it would have killed it with or without fan/cooling.",Neutral
AMD,"BS. Very few watercool their RAM. All you need is ANY kind of fan blowing on the RAM when going past 1.5v. And that is not to keep them alive, it is to keep them stable. RAM will spit out bit-errors way before they die. Normal DDR4 is rated for 85 C. Generally, it is best to keep them under 50-55 C if you overclock them.    DDR3 default is 1.65v, yes. What do people that OC ram on DDR5 run? Is it 1.4-1.5v? And default is 1.1-1.2v. Of course, XMP profiles for even DDR5 often runs at 1.4v. Have you heard of millions of RAM sticks dying?",Neutral
AMD,While running medium/ light loads (gaming) the core voltage now jumps to 1.3v+ while the 9800X3D stays around 1.1v,Neutral
AMD,"The memory controller is also the same, they're not developing a new IMC or upgrading the current one just for a factory overclocked 9800X3D, they're doing that for Zen 6. We've had 9850X3D users here stating that their CPU can't handle certain RAM configurations that they could achieve with a 9800X3D. It's just a silicon lottery. You might swap your 9800X3D for this factory overclocked CPU and get a worse IMC compared to what you had.  If the memory controller was any better AMD would have marketed the fact non-stop while charging extra money for it.",Negative
AMD,"DDR5 is irrelevant here, I'm talking about DDR4 voltages - and honestly I'm barely acquainted with DDR5 OC. DDR4 EXPO/XMP generally doesn't go over 1.4v and I don't know where you get the idea that many people daily 1.55-1.65v.",Negative
AMD,"Especially DDR 5 and crazy so dual rank DDR 5 is next level sensitive to temperature for single errors (classic 10k Karhu single errors)  So you're dead on, at least on AM5, no one in their right mind would daily sticks voltage high enough to kill them.",Negative
AMD,"The CPU's won't use more VID than they need to hit the maximum frequency that is on their boost table, even if it's safe and available.  For the 9800x3d out of the box, that means that whatever voltage that it takes to hit ~5225mhz is the maximum that you'll see. You may have had a 9800x3d which would be happy at 5500mhz with normal gaming voltage, but since 5225 was an arbitrary limit, the CPU would sit at 5225. It will then use the voltage that it thinks that it needs for 5225mhz, rather than using the full voltage.  Removing fmax and other limits so that you only hit the voltage/reliability limiters exposes the actual voltage range.  Likewise, applying an fmax limit to another CPU like the 9850x3d or the 9950x3d's vcache CCD brings behavior in line with 9800x3d (just deleting all of the frequency options near the top of the curve).  If you're riding the safety limiter at 1x scalar, then about 1.34 VID on zen5 (x3d or standard) is typical in games.",Neutral
AMD,"Ah, cool. I wasn't sure if they improved over a stepping or whatever else (been known to happen).  Yeah I'm aware that they're redoing it for Zen 6, which will be perfect timing-wise. Zen 5 can't really make use of faster memory outside of niche cases.",Positive

AMD,"If that is the case, then your CPU is restricted in software to a maximum boost frequency which is well below its capabilities, and it just never botheres to use a medium-high voltage because it's always running at a frequency which is stable with a low voltage. The scalar will allow for ~1.34 VID and there is hundreds of mhz of stable clock gain between 1.15v and 1.34v.  The 9800x3d can buy +200mhz via the PBO controls, but otherwise you need async eclk to fully bypass AMD's frequency lockouts.",Neutral
AMD,Yeah because there isnt a problem. RMA rates for the 9000 Series are in line with those of the 7000 series. Its a product that sells ten thousands of units so there will be dead CPUs every day or so.,Negative

AMD,"Just… now? Was there a recent spike in volume? This has been an issue for a while, and some BIOS updates have moved the needle in the right direction.

AMD,"Crazy how nobody is losing their shit like they did with Intel 2 years ago, considering AMD is also using the ""It's the motherboard manufacturer's fault"" line at this moment.  Look, I'm aware I'm in the AMD subreddit, so feelings matter over facts (like with any specific subreddit), but please look at the whole picture before downvoting. AMD and Intel are not your friends, and both are handling their respective issues horribly. I'm purely commenting on the community's response.",Negative
AMD,"It’s been a clip farm topic. People still discussing it while RMA rates are lower than their competitor are a joke really.   It’s a fascinating problem that deserves to be investigated, but the destructive intent with their videos is so petty.",Negative
AMD,"I don't know if you have been here for long but this has been going for years (since 3000 family where they degraded fast, we used to have 2 or more reports every week and then a year passed the next arch released and new symptom appeared where the chips simply burned the pads of various rails) and AMD and board vendors have acknowledged the issue and have been actively looking into it. Most MB manufacturers seem to have successfully fixed while others continue the same.  I still remember when AMD was going back and forward with agesa bioses and MB manufacturers were deleting them due to critical voltage measurement and regulation like the f5a.  https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/some-ryzen-7000x3d-processors-are-burning-out-high-voltages-may-be-to-blame/",Neutral

AMD,MSI boards have had so many issues that one of the largest PC manufacturers in Germany has removed them as a supplier.  Source: a friend is working there,Negative
AMD,"Clearing cmos was suggestion #1, after that it was testing the individual ram sticks, both ending in the same result. They do not have the knowhow / technical confidence to remove the CPU so they’re bringing it to a shop soon (I live too far away to check myself unfortunately)",Negative
AMD,"Your comment accidentally proves what I said. There was so much misinformation going around due to outrage that even though the oxidization issues concerned only a small batch of 13th Generation processors manufactured at the end of 2022, somehow it got crossed with the seperate issue of voltage misregulation causing failure. So people thought that the issue happened because of oxidization and that meant that EVERY Raptor Lake (and Refresh) chip was going to have this issue. The oxidization apparently was caught very early on and affected only some early 13th gen chips (meaning 14th Gen was only ever affected by Vmin shift and not oxidization). Thing is vmin shift was eventually addressed, and you only hear about issues from people that have outdated bioses, or people with RMAs running them on motherboards that probably got damaged from the first bad CPU.  Despite that, Intel still handled it like dogshit, and the first few months they also pulled the ""it's the manufacturer's fault"" card, and AMD seems to be doing the same",Negative
AMD,Yup they extended the warranty to 5 years if i can recall,Neutral
AMD,"Exactly, but they are also setting up a false narrative that it is a very bad situation, while RMA rates are well within the appropriate range.",Negative
AMD,That's what people and Intel said about 13th and 14th gen. Turned out that gaming bioses just exacerbated the Intel flaws. As an enthusiast you can't say for sure that it's only a bios problem.,Negative
AMD,-Users.  FTFY,Neutral
AMD,"It is because AMD provides AGESA as a binary ""black box"" to manufacturers to put in their BIOSes and it's ultimately AGESA that's responsible for controlling critical parameters related to the CPU and memory like limits to vCORE and vSOC.   Manufacturers can tune their BIOSes to an extent, but only within the limits defined by AGESA.",Neutral
AMD,"But the ""data"" shows that MSI is teh most reliable board manufacturer by far.",Positive
AMD,"Ah yeah, spontaneous failure is hard to figure out. But if it is the same issue as the dead ones it should have visible damage on the pins. The shop would be able to check at least.",Negative
AMD,"It's not misinformation? You're soloing out the oxidization issue but that wasn't the only one. Writing microcode is part of the manufacturing step. Intel can't blame mobo manufacturers if it's literally every single one of them, and every single 13/14th gen CPU that has been degraded will never work as intended and fail no matter what ""fix"" you install after the fact. If the AMD issue was on the same scale we'd have heard already just like how server hosters and hardware retailers rang the alarm bell with the amount of failures.  I literally know 4 different people that are on their 2nd or 3rd RMA at this point, and while the latest microcode claims to have fixed it it's just impossible to tell. They might have just been able to slow down thee degrading to the point it'll take a couple more years, I mean they've ""fixed"" it like 10 times already now. Meanwhile the breaking news is that there's 10 confirmed cases of 9800X3D's having issues on ASUS boards when it's one of the top selling CPUs in the world.",Negative
AMD,"The Intel failure rates were much higher, and the issue was down to architure, running out of spec only made the issue that was already there worse.  This has nothing to do with AMD, when less than 0.1% of the CPUs sold are failing is within margin of error.  We can't fix stupid, stop following content creators telling you to overclock and use PBO with ridiculous values.",Negative
AMD,"Intel's flaw was related to rapid changes in load, regardless of TDP. It could happen on the most conservative boards. They missed it in testing because they focused on full-load stress testing with high temps to check if the chips would burn out.  AMD's initial 5000x3D chips warned that the additional memory was fragile and could not tolerate the same limits as a regular processor. In third party reporting it's looked like 7000x3D and 9000x3D still have higher failure rates. Regular 9000 series chips do not seem to be showing a substantial bump.  That said, with geometries becoming so small internally, AMD better be testing for the same type of damage we saw on Intel processors.",Negative
AMD,"Considering AMD AGESA limits are high and intentionally outside of spec to allow for overclocking (which is for advanced users).  It is still the motherboard manufacturers fault for running CPUs out of spec, which is why AMD had to lower the AGESA limits in the 7000 Series.  I don’t know of a single motherboard manufacturer that doesn't try to run hardware out of spec to claim they provide better performance than the competition. There is nothing worse than a motherboard at default settings.  Adding insult to injury, people listen to content creators to enable and tweak overclock settings as if there were a universal standard for ""best settings"" (when, in fact, it’s different for everyone).  So no, it is neither AMD nor AGESA fault. Unless you want AMD to lock their CPUs like Intel (NO THANK YOU), you are free to go buy Intel and leave AMD alone for the advanced users",Negative
AMD,"Yeah I mentioned that they should check for that specifically, since we already ruled out a couple other things.",Neutral
AMD,You are presuming that they're running ridiculous values.,Negative
AMD,"There is not a single content creator video related to overlock and PBO that is accurate, cause everyones hardware and silicon has different ceiling, so yes they are running ridiculous values.

AMD,Are you sure that's not a symptom of a dying CPU?,Neutral
AMD,Nope. I'll wait for some time for it to be tested.,Neutral
AMD,Is there a source for that? (as in safe to buy prevent the issue),Neutral
AMD,While possible i didn't have any problems initially until i updated my bios when I saw the Gamers Nexus video.  But having tried to go back and run older versions of the bios they didn't fix the issue.  it could be either the CPU or the Motherboard but for now it still works.  But It could easily be that earlier versions of the bios damaged the CPU too.  I may ask for a replacement CPU  but I dont see the harm in giving it a bit longer to see if I can get a bios fix.  Asrock is looking into the issue right now and this is a step in the right direction.,Neutral

AMD,"No one knows  GN tried to replicate it and failed, asrock and amd are investigating,  a lot of dead cpus were running at stock and got killed",Negative
AMD,It could be the bios but the investigation is still pending. I beleive there were some reports that the bios was spike with more volts than needed. At least from experience the worst that’s happened with gigabyte is a beta bios bricked RGB controllers. (Luckily I dodged that update but it wasn’t everyone. It was also possible to reverse it without getting to technical).,Negative

AMD,Opinions on 9850x3d? Even for people who dont own a 9800x3d this refresh chip takes a pretty huge hit in efficiency for its minor performance uplifts.  I was planning on upgrading to this but considering I build in SFF is might just be better to pick the 9800x3d instead (especially with the price drops)  Id say this itteration is mid.

AMD,$499 for the CPU.. $1500 for RAM,Neutral

AMD,"Yeah, IMO the margin doesn't justify the gains, just like most modern TDP-boosted chips. It certainly has its place, though, and I imagine it does better than the 9800X3D when given the 9800X3D's power budget.",Neutral
AMD,If the 9800X3D didn’t exist I’d imagine no one would be really talking about the power draw of the 9850X3D for the level of performance delivered.  What will be interesting to see is how well it undervolts. It’s such a highly binned version of this chip I would not be surprised if it can be made to run cooler than a 9800X3D if set close to 9800X3D performance.,Neutral
AMD,"MSRP vs MSRP it's fine ($20 more). With the 9800X3D at $449 though, that's a much better value. I think with how the prices change, the value of each other will fluctuate. At most I'd pay 10% more for up to 5% performance bump. For comparison a 5090 is 3x to 4x the price of a 5080 at 50% higher performance. A 10% price increase for a halo product is nice, but not essential.   Hidden value king from this though is definitely the 7800X3D. Can sometimes be found even cheaper than a 5800X3D.",Positive

AMD,Should I return my 9850X3D and get the 9800X3D? It was a tiny price difference.,Neutral
AMD,Linus said the trade off isn't that bad at all,Negative
AMD,"Yep, and if you didn't get a lemon then you can always manually overclock it if you wanna have a 9850X3D for free, I've sometimes set my 9800X3D to 5700 MHz at 1.25v and it's rock solid stable with the same power draw and thermals than the factory overclocked 9850X3D, but I'm playing on a 4080 at 1440p ultra settings so the difference was laughable, I reverted back to PBO+100 and scalar x1, incredibly power efficient with per-core curve optimizer and gaming at 41-47c.",Positive
AMD,"if you don't care about the increased power draw and thermals then no, it's not the end of the world and will just hurt it in the summer time if your cooler is mediocre, but I wonder why you decided to go with that CPU to pair with a 6950XT.",Negative

AMD,I want Intel to win but sadly they only win against the HX370 which is a generation behind the 395+. So intel is still behind. They better price it well below the HX370 to regain market share. AMD lost the plot in terms of pricing and HX370 handhelds are well over 1300. If they can partner with MSI and produce a handheld for under 1000 they have a winner.

Intel need to improve 18a yields. AMD needs to get zen6 out. Whoever gets there first will be the winner.

Canned benchmarks they did good on, but a lot of apps were starting to get avx512 optimized more and they would lose HARD there. Not only that but there were certain games where it was just catastrophic, and not due to windows e core issues.    Look at Homeworld 3 CPU benchmarks (I know it sucks).",Positive

AMD,Yep,Positive
AMD,"Let's just wait for products to hit, maybe Intel is going to hit it out of the park, but they have a long way to go before I will trust their marketing slides.   AMD is no better in that regard, I'm not just shitting on Intel.   In all honesty, I'm pretty happy Intel is doing better on the iGPU side, cause it was so bad for so very long.   My laptop is currently an i7-1185g7, not their best showing, but was a step in the right direction on the iGPU side.   Not anything I would have bought brand new, but being a refurbisher in my spare time has perks.   My laptop is always 3-6 years old.",Positive
AMD,Intel's been down this road before. It's not worth it. 14900HX is the only reminder you need. How fast does it need to be before we start talking about just putting a GPU in? If I'm getting a laptop why would I get a power hog collapsing star? It's called mITX.,Negative
AMD,Spinning a delay of building a competitor into this? Good try,Positive
AMD,"To completely compete with Strix Halo (really just the graphics side) would require intel to increase the die size just like AMD did. In practice, even in gaming, it isn't worth it. Yes, you get between 20-30% more performance with Strix Halo up to 65W, and then pushing 80w+ Strix Halo opens up further to closer to 40-50% better performance. Thing is, it just doesn't make sense to create a large APU with those power requirements for full performance in today's market... especially at the prices of Strix Halo products. You can just get a solution with a dGPU at those prices.  I just wish Intel would push for Linux compatibility. Panther Lake is being held back by the suck that is current Windows 11 imo.",Negative
AMD,"Hmm, that's a shame.  I really like Strix Halo.  They're niche, no doubt, but with NVIDIA having DGX Spark, and AMD releasing a ""competitor"" later this year, kind of surprised Intel is going to ignore the compact AI development market.",Negative
AMD,"From what I've seen today on reviews, they really trade blows at different TDP ranges. I'm yet to see benchmarks that come out with the 70 something percent gains Intel claimed.",Neutral
AMD,"LPDDR tends to be more power efficient than GDDR, especially when shared with the CPU. Not to mention you lose less power to communication. In other words, an iGPU will always be more power efficient than a dGPU.",Positive
AMD,It still might not be a competitor because it's going to be expensive as hell. If one wants the bleeding edge chip they have to fork it out.,Negative
AMD,The 70% claim is against Strix Point which is the similarly sized offering from AMD. It only trades blows with Strix Halo because that's a far larger (and expensive to manufacture) chip whose gpu portion is as large as a desktop RX 7700. More cores at lower clocks means better efficiency.,Neutral
AMD,iGPU?,Neutral
AMD,"It’ll use less power, and it’ll do less work per watt too.",Neutral
AMD,"By ""this"" I meant the quote. As much as Pantherlake is great, I don't believe they were able to pull an AX launch off in time but simply didn't",Negative
AMD,It only trades blows at low power. Once you get higher wattages in it does not. But efficiency wise I think id trade my strip halo for an extra hour or battery gaming even with the lesser performance as I won't feel it much in the type of games I play. Panther Lake is a strategy gamers dream chip. Thin and light that can play the games at 1080p for 3 hours on battery.,Neutral
AMD,This is more based on die size than work per watt.,Neutral
AMD,Nah,Neutral
AMD,"I intended to say its large size was what allowed Strix Halo to also be competitive at certain low power ranges, at higher ones it completely dominates, you are absolutely right.",Positive

AMD,I very doubt,Positive
AMD,Eh as per the article the only thing that stands out is the iGPU and that's it. The rest is on par with a mid-range Ryzen AI 7 350. And you pair that with a 5050 and boom: Double the FPS of the Intel.,Neutral

AMD,"Seems like it got deleted, don't know why.",Negative
AMD,"Unless you want better battery life, reliable wake from sleep, better cpu and multi-core perf.   Apple proved you don't have to be gaming first to be successful.

AMD,"18A is not in the same league of N2.   Even 18AP is not on par with N2   14A is not ready  So unless they want inferior product to AMD (Zen6) which will be on N2, NovaLake will be on TSMC N2  14A is when Intel expects to match or surpass TSMC nodes",Negative
AMD,"Tell me you haven't watched the reviews without telling me.

The X2's efficiency is not going to be that much of any more than the X.",Negative
AMD,"Snapdragon has no advantages. It is not cheaper, it is not faster and it does not have better battery life at equal performance.

AMD,Keep on dreaming. Numbers speak for themselves.,Neutral
AMD,"I've mostly been picking up AMD as of late, but this is a great win Intel's needed for years. About the only potential downfall is pricing, but given that AMD has nearly zero design wins for Strix Halo on laptop, Intel has a pretty wide open field to work in.",Positive

AMD,Argh! My mistake!,Neutral
AMD,Does it really that matter? I mean intel 12th and 13th  gen was on par or even better than zen3 and zen4 .  Both intel 12th ans 13th gen were on intel 7 or 10nm while zen  3 was 7nm and zen 4 at 5nm.  If anything I don't get how intel dropped ball so hard with arrow lake . Going from 10nm(intel 7) in 14th gen to 3nm of tsmc in arrow lake should produce both efficiency and performance gain like how nvidia got going from samsung 8nm to tsmc 4nm in 30xx to 40xx.,Neutral

AMD,Nothing indicates that,Negative
AMD,Is this a troll? It's the X7 and X9 are going to be quite a bit better than a 350 are you joking? Do you read benchmarks or reviews at all? The ultra 5 with b 370 is probably gonna be at or above a 350-360.,Neutral
AMD,AMD Glazer spotted 🤡,Neutral
AMD,Well we have to buy new devices just cause some company is too lazy to make a native app and use a web wrapper like whatsapp,Negative
AMD,Apple was also mad about margins. It cheaper for them to make their own than beholden to Intel’s pricing.,Neutral
AMD,"Where did you see that? I’m not aware of any regressions vs Lunar Lake, and Intel is specifically releasing a handheld sku to deal with the super low power : high gpu performance regime.    SKU differences aside, take a 388H and throttle it to 17W and it greatly outperforms lunar lake.",Neutral
AMD,"Intel 7 was competitive in peak performance, but lacked efficiency. Also note that arrowlake utilized N3b which was notorious for poor yield and over complexity and quickly replaced with N3e in Apples line of products. Arrowlake also followed the 13th/14th gen debacle and Intel reduced ring bus clocks significantly to play it safe.  Most notably, going from a monolithic design to chiplets leads to increased latency which reduces gaming performance and makes it harder to hold higher clock speeds. Monolothic designs will always be faster in a 1:1 comparison but chiplets make up for it by being modular and cheaper to scale, something intel hasnt been able to really take advantage of until Pantherlake.",Negative
AMD,"The node helps, obviously, but you still need to design a product that works. The choice of node is not a magical solution.  Arrow Lake had flaws that showed themselves in certain workloads due to design. They \*did\* still get an overall efficiency boost but thats not a high bar given what they were coming from.",Neutral
AMD,"They were experimenting with tiles and it’s an early iteration. Not to mention they have more experience with their own fab.   Arrow lake smokes 14th gen in compiler workloads. Those faster e cores help a lot!   Outside of gaming workloads, it’s fine. Even with gaming workloads it does ok, just not a real jump from 14th gen. It was never going to beat x3d",Positive
AMD,It hardly does. Mid range chips from seven or eight years ago can still do everything that modern chips can. All you have is a bunch of tech consumers who convinced themselves that they need the latest tech.,Negative
AMD,"> Does it really that matter?  Yes, you're looking at something like 15% perf for a full node. That's very significant. A node shrink alone could constitute an entirely new gen in perf.   > If anything I don't get how intel dropped ball so hard with arrow lake  They redesigned the SoC fabric, and it's shit.",Neutral
AMD,No way! You've had your hands on real Panther Lake hardware already?? But it hasn't even been released yet! You must be a special redditor. Give me a break.,Negative
AMD,I'm talking about Krackan,Neutral
AMD,This test does: https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/prozessoren/intel-core-ultra-x9-388h-test.95776/seite-5  It looses quite strongly against the 288v (which is not anymore that efficient and far less so than the Ryzen 7 350),Negative
AMD,Any spec sheet will show you it will have only 4 cores for the GPU. Lunar lake has 8. Panther Lake cores would have to be twice as powerful as lunar lake which we know they aren't.,Neutral
AMD,Thanks for explaining,Positive
AMD,They still lose handily in efficiency and their multi core isn’t better than Strix Point,Negative
AMD,Not really. It loses against the 288v in the first test and wins against in the second test.  There is no direct comparison against the Ryzen 7 350 and I don't know how you even reached the conclusion that the Ryzen 7 350 is more efficient than lunar lake?  [Notebookcheck](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Panther-Lake-Core-Ultra-X9-388H-performance-analysis-Outpaces-Arrow-Lake-and-exceeds-Zen-5-in-efficiency.1212583.0.html) conducted fairly good efficiency tests that compare the single and multicore CPU perf/W. The Ryzen 7 350 is actually included in their list and ranks dead last in the multicore comparison so there's that and in the single core comparison Lunar Lake generally performs better than both but once again the Ryzen 7 350 is beaten by panther lake.  They even include a nice graph for different PL which also happens to include the Ryzen 7 PRO 350.,Neutral
AMD,"You are discussing SKUs. The reason lower stack PTL has fewer Xe cores is because they are nearly 2x efficiency.   However, should you take a higher SKU and configure TDP to 20W (or even 15W to account for external memory) it will be more efficient than Lunar. Lunar Lake is great, but PTL is much better.",Neutral
AMD,You'll see but not even in your wettest dreams the Ryzen will be beaten. Intel remains Intel after all.,Neutral
AMD,"It needs to be at least 2x as efficient to be as powerful because it has HALF as many cores. It isn't, therefore the GPU will be weaker. You can do that same TDP configuration on Lunar Lake. Not sure why that matters.  ""Nearly 2x more efficient"" translates to ""nearly as powerful"". But not quite.",Neutral
AMD,It is 70% faster. You’re comparing different SKUs. Compare top Lunar Lake to top Panther. How the TDP is configured is up to the OEM,Neutral
AMD,"We don't know how efficient those 28W Panther Lake chips run at 17W. Just because you can run it at such low power does not mean it will work well. It will certainly be much less efficient if it were to be run that way otherwise Intel would be gloating at how powerful and efficient their Panther Lake GPU is at 17W. The fact that they don't means it is well below their sweet spot of efficiency. You are basically starving it, similar to stalling an engine.",Negative
AMD,"The fact that it can even compare to AMDs halo product, which the avg consumer can’t afford is a win for Intel. Intel has plenty on leg room to expand the GPU too.",Positive
AMD,This suffers from bandwidth bottleneck. Strix halo is Quad channel while panther lake is dual. An igpu would benifit greatly with a quad channel,Negative
AMD,"This thing is absolutely nuts  AMD BTFO unironically, I'm floored. I never, ever would have considered an Intel chip before 2025, now this is the most obvious laptop part ever. AMD is surely sorely regretting recycling the same 780M and 890M chips for another entire gen, betting that Intel would continue stagnating.  This thing is gonna be a monster in handhelds.  I really, really wanted a Strix Halo laptop, but the lack of SKUs, price and the inflexibility with RAM kind of make it unappealing to say the least, not to mention the power draw compared to Panther Lake is unwelcome. These laptops are gonna be probably the best x86 in mobile has eaten in a very long time.  On top of that, it's almost making the 5050 look like a stupid part in a laptop. Why bother when you have a vastly more power efficient iGPU that will handle every desktop workload on top of being viable for gaming?",Negative
AMD,"“Takes on strict halo” at about half the performance (:  Title aside, this looks pretty great.",Positive

AMD,"The performance looks fantastic for high end $1k handhelds.    But the ""80% faster than AMD's 890M"" claim is absolute bullshit.  They tested against the HX370 with LPDDR5 5600.  That said, against an 890M that *hasn't* been crippled, it should still be 40-50% faster which is great.",Positive
AMD,"Will intel make it affordable for consumers though, or price it like LNL (2000+ USD laptops and up)",Neutral
AMD,"""compare"", it is half the performance. Still good for what it is, assuming it is priced right",Positive
AMD,"Well it's not just memory bandwidth. It's got about as much bandwidth as it needs to feed the Xe3 cores.   Panther Lake's GPU tile size is only 54mm^2 while Strix Halo's GPU is 308mm^2. For Panther Lake to compete with Strix Halo it would need 2-4 times as many Xe3 cores probably. That'd be expensive. There's a reason Strix Halo is so expensive and kind of low volume, bigger CPU more RAM and more expensive motherboard aside.",Neutral

AMD,Lunar lake is in sub 800$ laptops now and 12xe cpus are available for sale 1300$ despite the ram and cpu shortage.   The comparison is good even before likely price hikes for strix halo,Positive
AMD,"We’re talking mobile chipsets here, strix halo is what happens when you throw efficiency out the window, with Power (TDP) range, typically from 55W up to 120W. The ultra H 300 has default TDP of 25W, with Maximum Turbo Power (MTP) going up to 65W-80W. Intel has a better design, if they threw 40 XeSS3 cores on it, it would prolly run circles around Strix.",Neutral

AMD,"> (more than) half the price  Have we seen pricing? Not doubting it, I just haven't seen anything personally but probably missed it.  Strix Halo does seem to be a pretty mythical chip due to its price.",Neutral
AMD,Keep in mind that each Xe3 core is about as wide as an AMD WGP. We're looking at 1536 vs 2560 shaders. The B390 is 60% as wide as the 8060S. 20 Xe3 cores would match the 8060S in width. 40x Xe3 is as wide as the 7900GRE.,Neutral
AMD,"Bingo  Strix is also limited by being RDNA 3.5 and no FSR4, so it's rather dependent on raw throughput, and it can't possibly fit in a comfortable handheld that would last for more than an hour and a half under load.  I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage. I hope they keep it up, it would really be cool to see an AMD vs Intel APU console war generation.",Neutral
AMD,It's about 50% bigger die with 1 CCD (which seems comparable CPU performance),Neutral
AMD,https://youtu.be/X9eYQTkzxqU?si=Uzdz-E3QJzzVM42N  Not the only one comparing. Intel actually outperforms at lower wattage.,Neutral
AMD,">GPU's will take all the bandwidth you can feed them.   Didn't deny that. But 12 Xe cores is presumably considered the sweet spot, that's all I'm saying. And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.  Besides, Intel already has Nova Lake AX in the backlog, or whatever it's going to be called. Practically intel's strix halo. It'll have Xe3P cores, more powerful than Xe3, thus deemed more worthy of the halo treatment.",Neutral
AMD,"This is a big of exaggeration, as you can see with Nvidia moving to gddr7. While bandwidth has increased substantially, performance is clearly limited by lack of compute power",Negative

AMD,"Halo's die is still quite a bit bigger, but from the Intel side, you need to include IO, GPU and about half of the compute die which has the MCs, encoders / decoders, etc. to match the ""GPU"" die of Halo, so it is more like 200mm² to 300mm² when compared",Neutral

AMD,"The SKU count is roughly doubled because you have each step with/without vPro - these get a 100MHz max turbo frequency bump, but the main benefit is you can run the corporate firmware with vPro support, so you get additional security and manageability features. Exception is the Ultra 9 where they just do it with vPro support as standard.  These have a higher cost because you are getting more features.  You could make it so you just have one CPU and then the manufacturer pays a license for corporate firmware per device, but that's more work to then ensure manufacturers are licensing machines correctly, and more confusing for end-users where now if you're buying a corporate device with vPro support you know you are looking at Core Ultra 236V and 268V for vPro support whilst 226V and 258V don't have it.",Neutral

As of right now only the ending 8 differentiates the 338H from the small-GPU SKUs, which IMO is not clear enough.

Aside from that I think the biggest problem with this new architecture is simply there's little reason to buy in. It was only recently (if memory serves, I could be wrong on this) announced that the next generation of CPUs will share this platform and later ones will be on a new socket. When AM4 was announced we knew that it would persist for multiple generations and now with AM5 - why would you buy a board that will be obsolete when its time to upgrade when you could buy into a platform that will support your next 1-2 CPUs?

AMD,"IMO corrupt tech sites and tech YouTubers are behind ARL’s failure for two reasons.   The first: AMD MCM processors without 3D cache are bad for gaming, and it’s hard to find this information in 90% of charts to warn intel about the consequences of going down this path, even though they should have done their own tests and experiments.   The second: in my own tests, the 265K was 15% faster than the 9700X on launch BIOS. Through BIOS updates, that gap extended to 20%, making it only 7%-10% slower than the 14700K. Yet on some very questionable charts, the 265K is shown as slower than the 9700X.   For experienced users, RPL CPUs’ temperatures can be lowered by 20°C by turning Hyper-Threading off and undervolting. For inexperienced users, ARL is better, as it runs 20°C cooler out of the box.   I believe that in 2026 we deserve raw, unedited video benchmarks that start from the desktop, show full system specs, then enter game-by-game benchmarking—no more charts with zero evidence to back them up.   When I tried to confront HUB with my benchmarks, I got blocked to cover up their lies and corruption. If they truly cared about which CPU is faster, they would share their in-game benchmark scores and discuss them in a scientific way, but that’s not their goal. The numbers go up and down for the highest bidders.   Lastly, I believe Nova Lake, with its expected 144 MB cache, will be faster than Zen 6 X3D by 10–20% as 9700x in real world is 20% slower than 265k and if both got the same IPC uplift NL will end up on top.

We landed on 265K, it benches very favorably compared to AM5 parts in nearly every workload except for gaming, and even then, that's mostly the X3D parts, and even then, that's when there is virtually no GPU bottleneck.   Most initial ""gaming"" reviews were done exclusively with 5090s, which is extremely unrealistic for most gamers and gave an extremely false impression that you would see a massive uplift by buying this part compared with the alternative CPU parts in gaming.   A lot of reviewers such as HUB have done a lot of work to correct this impression with a variety of testing scenarios and explaining their reasoning behind removing the GPU limiting factor as much as possible in benchmarks. Incidentally, these reviews typically showed that anything less than a 5080 sees virtually no benefit with a 9800X3D versus, say, a 9700X, and incidentally the two parts that saw no discernible benefits were the Radeon 9070XT and the 9070.  Obviously, if you have a 5090 and an unlimited budget with price being no factor, your best bet for top tier performance in all categories is a 9950X3D, but that just isn't what most people are looking at.  I myself bought into the future proofing mentality with my CPU and bought a 9800X3D, and ironically bought another AMD Radeon 9070XT to pair it with, a GPU that seems literally no performance gain compared to a 9700X, let alone a 285K. The same 285K that takes a dump all over the 9800X3D in nearly every other productivity benchmark.  I guess the good news is that when I upgrade my GPU in 2-4 years, at least I'll take advantage of the 9800X3D in games, lol. But considering it cost me over $900 for CPU, RAM, and motherboard, that's cold comfort. Ironically I probably would have made out a lot better buying a 5700X3D or a 5800X3D and the 9070XT and keeping my AM4 board and DDR4 RAM and saving $600.",Positive

AMD,"I suspect they just didn't have enough time to change anything. MTL releasing in Dec 2023, internal testing I'm sure yielding some set of data, and external reviews giving other feedback, even by the release of MTL, ARL has probably been in the pipeline for years and probably locked into certain design choices regardless of the feedback and testing.  Additionally I suspect that on mobile chips/laptop gaming rigs there's less focus on each individual part because  a) few people hardcore game on laptops b) the latency can be blamed on other things since laptops are a prepackaged consortium of parts and it's harder to isolate, and  c) therefore laptops tend to be evaluated as a whole rather than the individual pieces that comprise them.   Therefore the ""latency issues"" only became a massive kerfuffle when the offending cpu could be isolated and tested alone, and reviewers needed something to complain about.   That's even if Intel was considering latency as the issue everyone made it out to be. Intel could have looked at it and considered the latency worth the cost to improve in other areas and serve as intels seminal desktop entry utilizing disaggregated silicon. Then gamers came and lost their shit that the newest Intel chip deprioritized something that impacted their precious fps- even though the impact was ""the new one is approximately the same to maybe a little worse as last gen in most games"".   Notwithstanding the fact that the 200 series chips retain healthy gen-to-gen perf uplift and a _massive efficiency improvement_ in productivity and general computing, and boosting the NGU and D2D clocks (which are _very_ low from the factory, and can be done with the app that Intel _has specifically designed for tuning their chips_ and is freely available (XTU)) brings the gaming performance to ""approximately the same to a little better in most games"". Contrary to what some people may think these chips are not solely or even majority used for gaming and there are other use cases Intel can to think about/chose to prioritize.   To be fair, gamers and tech enthusiasts are the ones who will care the most and therefore have a disproportionately large impact on the kind of publicity the chip will get. So, was this intels smartest PR decision? Maybe not. But I think it was still a sound engineering decision, regardless of whether or not they had feedback or data on the issue, even if it didn't go over very well with their loudest customer base.  And this is all overshadowed by the fact that if you stuck even the most hardcore of gamers on a blind trial and told them to identify what kind of chip they were gaming on, I have a hard time believing any of them would be able to tell with any certainty which is which.   Once you get to 60 fps, the vast majority of people stop caring. Whats five fps going to do to radically change your gaming experience so much that it's unplayable? Which brings me back to one of my original points: If you care _that much_, you can go spend your money _elsewhere_.",Neutral

AMD,"Let me explain why it will not degrade my CPU.  1. **TVB (Thermal Velocity Boost) is disabled when I set the turbo limit.** 2. **Current is not the issue.** First, even Intel chips were failing at idle. Second, you stated that ""the same power limit at lower voltage necessarily means more current."" That is incorrect, if it drew more current, then why does lowering voltage reduce power consumption? Have you missed basic physics? 3. **CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve.** The main issue was that either the CPU or the motherboard was supplying excessive voltage, or the CPU was requesting too much. Higher voltage is required for extreme single-core boosts, such as 5.9 GHz. This is why i3 and i5 CPUs were not affected. When I limit my boost and apply an undervolt, the CPU no longer requests high voltage. It might request slightly higher voltage for 5.5 GHz, but that is nowhere near the voltage required for a 5.9 GHz boost. 4. **The same principle applies.**  Its seems you are a failure of high life form.

I fail to see how we went from talking about a failing architecture, which I don't think of Intel's product line as, to the whole bailout discussion. Maybe because I said AMD didn't get bailed out? I think maybe you forget that AMD had to offload global foundries, I don't think anyone even blinked when that happened and it's likely because that was a different era.   My post had nothing to do with the bailout versus architecture (or saving it) , apart from mentioning that I don't believe as a consumer I should feel motivated to buy Intel over AMD, or any other American firm, at the moment.   To be very clear, as this is personal for you, I do own Intel equipment including an Arc graphics setup for one of my children. I'm not anti-Intel or anti-American at all.   I know the history between AMD and Intel fairly well. Oversimplifying, AMD as it is doesn't exist without Intel. AMD only grew because they were the most successful second source producer for Intel, and the most successful at riding the thin grey line between patient infringement and unique implementation of similar IP that kept them alive while everyone else in the X86 space either died or became irrelevant to the consumer or enterprise space. After Itanium, the story levels out with both companies becoming effectively unwilling AMD64 codependents, and I'm saying that humorously.   Intel would gladly own the X86 market outright. So would AMD. At the end of the day, we need the two driving innovation through competition. Even if the CHIPS Act, the government stock acquisition, and the nVidia partnership are solely aimed at bringing more, needed, chip manufacturing to the US, it could create a situation where that amount of leverage puts Intel into a hyper dominant position again in the near future. Honestly, I hope I'm wrong.",Negative

AMD,"\>then why does lowering voltage reduce power consumption?  I have no idea what is the workload you are using which is guaranteed to never hit the limits. Solitaire?   Undervolting does not guarantee lower power usage with modern boosting CPUs. It very obviously (to any sane person) depends on workload.  \>Maybe read here more.   \>Thomas\_Hannaford, Employee   ‎ You are so cute.  \>Motherboard power delivery settings exceeding Intel power guidance.  Literally what I said in 2, 3, 4 but in stupid terms.  \>Microcode and BIOS code requesting elevated core voltages which can cause Vmin shift especially during periods of idle and/or light activity.

This is verifiably bullshit because nothing about mobile processors protects them from wrong voltage received because of wrong LLC settings.  \>CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve  If you do not know that Intel is requesting high voltage to avoid insufficient voltage before frequency boost you do not know jack shit. It is literally what happens under description ""**Microcode and BIOS code requesting elevated core voltages which can cause Vmin shift especially during periods of idle and/or light activity**"" and there is a video proof of that with an oscilloscope.

AMD,"I believe that refined process nodes (the “+++” stages) are what really improve clock speeds, not the first generation of a new node, or at least this is the case for the last 15 years.   Here are some examples:   -Intel’s 32nm Sandy Bridge came after the early 32nm CPUs (dual-core i3/i5 300/500 series and the 6-core 980X), and Sandy Bridge turned out to be an excellent overclocker.   -22nm Ivy Bridge and Haswell were mediocre in that regard, while Haswell-E (a more mature implementation) overclocked better. Broadwell-E and early Skylake also weren’t great for OC.   -Once the node matured, things improved again. Coffee Lake (refined 14nm) made 5 GHz relatively easy. The same pattern repeats with 10nm: Alder Lake (12th gen) came after Tiger Lake and could already reach ~5 GHz, while Raptor Lake pushed clocks even higher, up to ~5.7 GHz.   Overall, higher clock speeds tend to come from node maturity and refinement, not from the first use of a new manufacturing process, and I believe 5.8ghz could have been possible if intel used its own 10nm process node on ARL considering its HyperThreadingless.",Positive
AMD,"On that side, it'll depend on what the US does with the stock it has. Canada bought GM stock during the 2008 crash, and then quietly sold it off as GM recovered. If the US does that, I don't really see an issue.  The MAGA part was a half hearted comment, made to follow the weirdness of the whole situation and comment I was replying on as well. As I said in a separate post:  ""It's so strange to me that we've hit a spot in consumer and enterprise computing where politics is now a factor (speaking about how decisions beyond national security are now driven by politics and trying to be on the right side at any moment when it matters). It's a different game when companies have to worry about that side, far too many consumers make decisions based on their politics when all that does is cause other issues. Obviously I won't go farther than that in a tech focused discussion lol, but I will say again that it's a different game and I don't think anyone wins if it becomes the norm.""  I'm going to add, light heartedly, I do hope we see AMD/nVidia/Qualcomm/etc manufactured and final packaged products coming out of Intel Foundries one day. I'm not sure how or if it will work, but the situation seems dead set not to allow significant further nodes beyond 2 nm or packaging to occur outside of North America. If the US wants viable national chip production, Intel is the better option, I hope it works out in a way that maintains design level competition while meeting national security goals.",Neutral

As much as I'd like to provide my technical insights on this upgrade path, I'm not in a position to provide specific suggestions since this involves hardware modifications to an OEM system.  For the best compatibility outcome and to ensure optimal system performance, I strongly recommend reaching out to your system manufacturer directly. They can provide definitive guidance on supported CPU upgrades (i5-8400 to i7-9700) and maximum RAM configurations for your specific model. We don't want to inadvertently bypass any warranty terms and conditions on your system by providing modification recommendations that might affect your coverage.  Your system manufacturer's technical support team will have access to the exact specifications, BIOS compatibility matrices, and supported hardware configurations for your Vostro 3670 model. They can confirm whether the motherboard supports the i7-9700, the maximum RAM capacity (64GB vs 128GB), and any potential limitations or requirements for these upgrades.

But as of now, we don't really have any information that directly points to a competing product.      In fact, I might be crazy but I feel like it is more likely that the actual answer to Strix Halo will be all Intel silicon, because Nvidia is very horny for all things ai and all things datacenter.",Neutral
AMD,"I mean no offense, but Passmark is irrelevant.  Even comparing the 890m to the 7600m (non-xt), the 7600m is usually twice as fast, with dips down to ~60% faster, and lifts up to ~170% faster.     NoteBookCheck has an extremely robust dataset of benchmarks in games for both the 890m and the 7600m (non-xt) at various resolutions, and they show not only a clear winner, but a very large difference in the performance of these devices.      Now I'm not trashing what the B390 will be, because we need an iGPU fight here.  But thinking that the 7600m (non-xt) is only ~15.7% faster than the B390 ((new-old)/old gives percent change) because of Passmark is erroneous.",Neutral

AMD,Well done. Still using two H55m machines with OC (x3450 and i5 661).  They also OC decently at stock voltage keeping turbo and all power savings. My X3450 does 2.6 -> 3.3Ghz(3.8 turbo).

AMD,"The most important characteristics of a laptop are battery life ( power efficiency) and screen quality. That is what sells ( non apple ) clamshells.    All the other crap they test in various reviews are mostly meaningless to the actual user. There is a very small %age of the market for high power/perf laptops and even smaller market for gaming.   Most of the reason a laptop is “slow” is bloatware and has nothing to do with the cpu choice anyway.  And Intel is already “beating” AMD in laptop cpu sales, by a substantial margin. People incorrectly assume AMD has most of the market share in all segments because of the very noisy and super-biased gaming reviewers, who mostly focus on $3000+ gaming desktop builds. Yes AMD is handily winning there.",Neutral
AMD,"I have a T14s Gen 5 Core Ultra 5 135U and recently I saw \~9h of battery life, browsing websites. It's quite nice piece of hardware so with Lunar Lake it would be just perfect. Of course not for heavy workload because for this we will have Panther Lake. I work in tech for years, not an expert in laptops area but I can assure you that new CPUs from Intel that I mentioned earlier are way, way, way better than previous generations.",Positive
AMD,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works. It's like the 2001 Toyota of the laptop world, it's not winning prizes for looks, but it'll never die, gets good mileage (battery life), and is easily repairable. Maybe not the laptop you want, but definitely the one you need (excluding people who need something like a dedicated GPU or really need super high CPU performance).",Positive

Amd historically has just been a cpu seller, telling oems to go wild and do whatever . . . And it always ends very badly.   The biggest sign amd is taking share is not cpu benchmarks, but will be things like having premium screens, good thermals, lack of bloatware, dual channel memory, good SSDs, good colors, etc etc. and . . .

AMD,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good. It seems the Intel chip was designed to be very efficient during periods of downtime and something like viewing a PDF or editing a document has a LOT of downtime for the CPU",Positive
