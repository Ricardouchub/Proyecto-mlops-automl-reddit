Intel,"3050 performance at half the power, can't argue with that.  I do wonder how long it will be before the low-end dGPU disappears entirely from laptops, suspect these new chips probably aint it due to price but it's presumably coming.",Neutral
Intel,"While Geekbench's OpenCL isnt super popular for GPU testing;  I still cant believe a mainstream integrated GPU is actually competing with laptop 3050Ti, and these results still aren't with final optimizations!  by the time Panther Lake comes out, Intel claiming that its as fast as laptop RTX 4050 might actually be true lol",Neutral
Intel,Are these better than Ryzen igpu? How do they compare to RTX 4050 AND 5050 in non demanding game?,Neutral
Intel,"I'm excited sure but if the claims are true how can anyone here expected these to be reasonably priced and sell well? If it competes with a laptop dedicated GPU it will be priced 2-3 times that laptop. The 285H isn't even that popular and its expensive, hope the 385H is affordable AND the claims are true.",Neutral
Intel,"The score is slightly above a GTX 1650 Super which in turn is slightly above a GTX 1060 which is barely matched by current most performing 128 bits iGPU (Lunar Lake / Strix Point)  Even if we expect 50% improvement compared to 890M, that's still half the performance level of a full power mobile RTX 3060.

Intel,"It'll happen eventually but they have a few issues.  First is memory bandwidth, they'd need to put a wider bus on it to address which is costly.  Second is the memory itself, they need something with higher bandwidth (but that might be addressed with LPDDR6).  To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.  Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.  A think that in 2028 big APU solutions can compete well against XX50 series and most XX60 cards.  It isn't happening before then however.",Negative
Intel,Apple's M5 already beats the 3050Ti though.,Neutral

Intel,this GPU is also coming into the 355H btw (more specifically there's a Ultra X7 version of the 355H with the full 12-core GPU)     and iirc last time the 255H was pretty popular,Neutral
Intel,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.  EDIT: 8060S (Strix Halo) is \~18,000 for reference.  EDIT 2: 890M (strix point's top end) about 8,100, so the PTL 12Xe chip will smoke that.  I'm excited about it, it looks like a great chip!",Neutral

Intel,"Only sticking point seems to be cost I suppose, implementing a truly competitive iGPU looks like it will be expensive if Strix Halo is anything to go by.

Bang for buck AT HIGHER RESOLUTIONS — that’s where it’s at. And I’ve had 4090 (sold), amd 9070(sold). Never would I pay what they are asking for a 5090.

Blurs my picture even on best settings possible.",Positive
Intel,Upselling,Neutral
Intel,IMO it's probably not economical for them to do it.   Gaming laptops/handhelds are already niche enough as it is -- doesn't make sense for them to package both and for OEMs to carry both for just for a ~$1-200 delta between the units. Those who want the full GPU will just pay for it.,Negative
Intel,"You gotta remember these CPU’s don’t have multi-threading. AMD gets 16 threads out of their 8 core z1 and z2 extreme but with these core ultra’s you get one core and that’s it. A full on physical core is better than a virtual core, but the same amount of cores with multi-threading is much better than just a same core-count CPU without it. Intel are offering up to 16 cores which is 16 cores/16 threads, but generally should offer better multi-core performance vs an 8-core 16-thread. If anything it’s nice Intel have the ability to improve core count offerings without significantly raising the power requirements.   I for one veered away from the MSI Claw 8 AI+ as a standalone PC solution because it lacked the multi-core performance I needed with it only having 8 physical cores and no multi-threading. A 16-core offering is exactly what I need.",Neutral

Intel,"If anything, seems strictly worse than N3, even compared to older iterations. That's not great for a node that was supposed to go toe to toe with N2. Especially if the production cost is more in line with the latter.",Negative
Intel,"18a is initially launching with its lower power variant, which is why the only nova cpus that will use it for the compute tile are the laptop ones. The higher power variant comes later",Neutral
Intel,"Jaykihn, whose tweets these leaks are based on, says that the design characteristics cannot be extrapolated to the node itself.   So it is less likely that the clocks are limited by 18A. It is just what was decided for this particular product.",Neutral
Intel,"> […] It doesn't seem like it improved on N3 and I know that they were targeting better frequency and lower power than they got.  Well, we already had rumors of Intel struggling to hit actual intended frequency-goals, no?  Though especially the actual performance-metrics of the node will be quite sobering I think.  The power-draw of these SKUs is supposed to be a TDP of *officially* 25W – In reality, these parts are allowed to draw as much as 55W (2+0+4 or 4+0+4) and 65/80W (4+4+4 and 4+8+4) respectively.  So it must be seen, if these parts are any more efficient in daily usage, or just a side-grade to Lunar Lake.",Neutral
Intel,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power. A 10-15% frequency advantage would go a long, long way towards closing gaps if it comes as a relatively small power cost.",Neutral

Intel,Laptop.,Neutral
Intel,Since when is any user determining what cores they want to use and when?,Neutral
Intel,It makes sense to have three as the low-power cores prioritize keeping the power consumption low for battery life but to achieve this they aren't attached to the ring bus which hurts performance so 8 regular E cores are also used,Neutral
Intel,">I can't say I'm entirely sold on the idea of having three core clusters humming inside my laptop.  From a user's perspective, CPU's are a blackbox and the inner-working details are irrelevant. What matters is results. They want, typically, a balance of performance, battery life, heat / fan noise, and cost, placing greater emphasis on one of these categories over the others.  The idea is that P cores = performance optizied  E cores = Area optimized  LP-E Cores = power optimized.  The theory being to have different core types focus on different parts of PPA.  E cores and LP-E cores are the same microarchitecture. Just LP-E cores are off-ring so the ring (and rest of the cores) can be powered down in light-load scenarios.  Intel's biggest problem is that looking at each of the cores, the P cores perform their designated role the worst. 200% larger than E cores for \~10% more IPC and \~15% more clockspeed is a pretty rough trade off - and by the time you've loaded all P cores and need to load E cores too, that clockspeed difference diminishes hard.  Intel's better off (and all rumors point this way) to growing the E cores slightly and making that architecture the basis of the new P and E cores (like Zen vs Zen-C)",Neutral
Intel,"> Now, I'm sure those might be useful in some niche use cases, but I'm speaking from an average user's perspective.  You are the niche use case.

Intel,"And with all the issues Windows already has with the scheduler, I fully expect it to never be able to properly utilize the different cores.

Intel,Darkmont should really not be that far off Cougar Cove. Certainly not *slow*.,Negative
Intel,The E-Cores are plenty fast for most use-cases by now and there are 8 of them in there. Aren‘t they even ahead of the skylake IPC by now? 8 will be doing a great deal with a good clock frequency.  Only the 4 LP-Cores are kind of weak. But they aren‘t attached to the ring-bus and really only used for offloading low req Backgroundtasks and an idling machine. So that you can turn off the faster cores when they aren‘t necessary.  But for performant gaming and productivity it is basically a 12 core machine.,Positive
Intel,I hope there's a 4+0+4+12 for handhelds but they might not consider adding a whole new tile configuration packaging line worth it over just giving the OEM a discount.,Negative

Intel,"> Not great, not terrible.

Intel,"> BSPD and transistor density is flattening the VF curve on the high-end   He doesn't make this claim. BSPD in particular was supposed to help the most at high voltage, and the density does not appear to meaningfully differ from N3, which it still regresses relative to.    Best case scenario, the node, for other reasons, can't hit as high voltages as N3, and the top of the curve is just capped. But you wouldn't expect thermals to be such an issue then.    Doesn't seem to be any evidence of the core-level VF curve benefiting from the node either.",Neutral
Intel,"Jaykihn attributes only density to the supposed heat issues, not BSPD. Which makes sense because the process guy and Stephen Robinson both talked about having to space out the signal and power wires when working with BSPD.  If they prioritized density, then it is possible that frequency could not reach the theoretical maximum due to crosstalk or heat issues.",Neutral
Intel,"18A has always been low density, but expected to compensate for it with very efficient frequency scaling past peak perf/W. It was always going to struggle in laptops, where you rarely push past the best perf/W due to thermal and battery constraints.  Wait for the desktop/server chips before you call it. With fewer thermal constraints and much higher power budgets, they should be able to push well past the perf/W peak, where it should continue to scale well and for a long time before it starts hitting severely diminishing returns.  I'm not talking 300W monster CPUs, but the scaling between a 65W and 105W 18A CPU should be more significant than on current nodes, where you might gain like 10-15% additional performance from that 50% power bump. I'd expect 65W to 105W on 18A to yield 20-25% due to the benefits of BPD.",Neutral

Intel,"I actually suspect otherwise - speculation on my part, but I suspect that they were running into unexpected process issues when they pumped the frequency and/or voltage higher so they had to scale back performance.  It almost feels like a process bug that they discovered when making the actual chips.  They've also talked about kind of weak yields on 18A on their latest earnings call.  That makes me optimistic about the improvement opportunity in a more mature 18A if they can chase down these issues, and perhaps even more in 18AP if they can clean up these bugs.  If they have a 'double upgrade' opportunity in both fixing the discovered 18A issues and implementing the originally planned 18AP improvements then it could end up being a somewhat bigger jump.  Don't think it'll be an N2 beater though.  18AP *might* beat the best of N3 in some applications, we'll see.  For that you'd want to look ahead to 14A where the CFO mentioned on the earnings call (and he was somewhat realistic in other areas so it's more believable here) that 14A has been a positive surprise and they're actually pretty excited about it.  It's possible that if Intel gets more experience on High-NA versus TSMC that they might start having an edge later on.  Maybe.",Neutral
Intel,"> Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD   And yet we see the exact opposite here.

Intel,"Yeah after being reminded that the LPE cores are also Darkmont like the E-Cores I looked up the layout in detail and the differences is simply the P and E cores are on a large Cluster with L3 Cache and a fast ring-bus, but the LPE cores are seperated from that Ring-bus and don't have any L3 Cache (just access to a ""memory side-cache"" accessible by the NPU and small cluster but not the large cluster).     They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them. The small cluster could be used to offload background tasks to themselves (if the powerlimits aren't hit), which could at least improve 1% lows and fps stability.",Neutral

That only suddenly changed by 2017–2019, when Intel suddenly increased core-count in mobile swiftly from Quad- to Hexa- and ultimately Octa-cores, while pushing the TDP in quick succession  into insane territory.  *That was the time, Asus took about a year to manage applying liquid-metal en masse, for Intel-notebooks!*  You are right with your sample here, yet you only confirm what I said before. Only past quad-cores it was.",Neutral
Intel,"> The idea is that because LP-E cores are off ring, you can power gate the rest of the cores when you're doing light tasks, getting much better battery life.  Do you happen to know, if that (ring-bus related) was the same principle on MTL?  > The failure of MTL/ARL's LP-E cores was that there was only 2 and they were very weak, so in practice, even a single web page would turn the ring back on and move the process back to the main cores, **negating the entire point of them**.  Yeah, talking about throwing some completely untested sh!t onto the market, irregardless of the fact, if the product makes sense or not — A true classic, I'd say. Just Intel being Intel.  Since dropping those LPE-cores on MTL, would've actually made the mask and thus needed die-space *smaller*, which in turn would've actually *increased* their yields \*and\* in return profit-margins already …  But muh, benchmark bars and ""AMD has moar corez!!"", I guess.  > LNL/PTL/NVL have much more powerful LP-E cores, 4 of them instead of 2, so common tasks can stay entirely within the LP island, and they're on the same compute tile, so they're also used in full nT workloads.

In others words they want Panther Lake to ride on the momentum and positive vibes the B series branding has garnered.   Xe³ is a Xe³ based architecture like Xe³P is architecturally but there is more to selling a product than the engineering, keep in mind there's strong rumors that there will be a B770 launch, Intel also just released the B60 and later this year will provide a big software expansion to Bxx cards so the B series brand is still full of life. Xe³P will launch much later and at that point Intel feels there will have passed enough time to leave the B series branding behind.",Neutral

Intel,"They would be extremely stupid not to continue to release discrete graphics cards, even if they decide to release 2-3 gaming SKUs per new generation; entry/budget, mid-range, high-end, etc.  - they win. until they keep iterating up, maturing driver, increasing install user base, improving software, until the point they can target higher segments (enthusiast tier)  Gaming GPUs remain the flagship component that pushes the limits of silicon design, features like ray tracing, AI upscaling, and real time path racing all debut in gaming before trickling into pro and AI workloads. Every research report shows that demand for high-end GPUs is still strong. Steam HW survey shows the most popular GPUs are still mid-range gaming cards, showing that discrete GPUs remain central to the PC ecosystem.  And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",Neutral

Xe3 just have additional optimizations and HW blocks along the lines of OMM (confirmed) and whatever new tech Intel decides is worth pushing for higher end parts.

Intel,"> It explicitly calls BMG dGPU cards ""discrete"" and does not do so for PTL  Of course not, since it would instantly tank their reputation and will kill all further ARC-sales?!  Do you actually think, that Intel is that stupid to plain announce the death of ARC-series graphics-cards? Do you think they'd even sell a hundreds cards after such a announcement? Who would by a dead-end line of graphics-cards, which won't even get any further driver-support and still have disastrous drivers like Intel's ARC? NO-ONE!  Of course they virtue signal it through the backdoor here, to preserve the sell-off the of the rest of pile of shame of their B-series graphics-cards as long as possible (leaving users with none support afterwards), and *only then* pull the plug afterwards when they went through their inventory …  Since when are you following Intel? Intel has always done so, and only announced a sudden discontinuation once the inventory was sold (leaving customers in the open with no further support overnight), despite virtue signalling a continuation all the time (to preserve a proper sell-off).  ---- Wasn't this exactly the same story with **Optane** back then? Each and every question upon a future support was answered in the affirmative, only to pull the plug overnight again as usual …  I'm not another piracy of cons here, it's Intel pulling the same Optane-stunt with ARC – Happily selling off their cards, knowing darn well, that they will pull the plug, yet refuse to actually play with open cards again.",Negative

Intel,"You have to look at this from both sides.  This would give NVidia the ability to offer OEMs a tightly integrated on SOC gfx solution vs a separate discrete gfx package as it is now. This would lower costs for NVidia's customers as well as improve performance and Intel's cpu's get to ride that train.   Intel has a long track record of using integrated gfx so it's certainly right up their alley to take this on.  Could Xe gfx coexist with NVidia? Yep, I think so.  Xe could be the budget igfx option and iNVidia is the premium integrated solution. That's basically how it is now with Intel Arc/Battlemage & GTX.   On the DC side, Intel has absolutely no gfx solution at this time and won't have anything for at least two years.  Intel already sells NVidia when a gfx solutions are needed so tighter integrated products will benefit both sides in that DC space as well.",Positive
Intel,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work. And even if NVIDIA wants to keep Intel's fabs open, I doubt they want to run them either.",Neutral

Intel,The b580 is still good at $250 and it’s only recently in the past month the 5060 and 9060xt 8gb dropped near or at $250 in some instances.  It’s a good card at 1440p aswell and it has 12gb of the other 2 8gb cards.

Intel,"It's a really good general purpose card. Perhaps not the best card if you want to squeeze out the most fps out of games, but it performs really well in a wide range of tasks including gaming. And yes 12GB VRAM really comes in handy.  It can easily be found for under $250. B580 is still cheaper than 5060 and 9060 XT and even RTX 5050 and RX 7600, especially in the UK where you can find a B570 for only 20 pounds more than RTX 3050. That's way cheaper than RX 6600, it's a no brainer. But the prices could only go down thanks to economy of scale mostly. It's been produced for a while, that's why.  Also one of the big reasons it's still selling now is thanks to good publicity. Imagine if it came out as the same time as RX 9060 XT. HWU would tear a new hole regardless of how much of an improvement it is over the Alchemist cards and the impressive productivity performance.

Intel,"iirc, SR-IOV and VDI support in the coming months, toggleable ECC support, and it is ISV certified",Neutral
Intel,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction. Very important when running 24-48 hour simulations.",Neutral

Intel,"SR-IOV is Virtual GPU (SR-IOV is IO Virtualization used to split PCIe lanes into virtual functions so their physical function can be shared between VMs). No consumer cards support Virtual GPU right now besides Pascal/Turing with driver hacks.

I believe VDI is Microsoft's implementation. I believe I've done VDI on my RTX 2070 before (I have done seamless sharing between host and VM), but I don't know if it's possible with AMD. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm more familiar with the Linux side / vGPU than VDI.  ECC is Error Correcting RAM. I generally don't understand the use case for ECC either, but it is ubiquitous in HPC. All server boards support ECC RAM.  In modern environments most of these features need 16GB of VRAM minimum, but if you ever wanted to try it on a consumer card, you could get an old RTX 20 series and try it out with some driver mods. Optionally, the P40 is still pretty cheap ($250 used) and doesn't need those hacks at the cost of drawing a lot of power, which Intel has solved with their Battlemage Pro platform (by far the cheapest VRAM/$/W you can get).",Neutral

Calculations, it absolutely depends on what you're calculating and which bit gets flipped; flipping the low-order bit in a number might not matter much and flipping the high-order bit could cause a big error.  Networking, it depends on whether the protocols you use have more error checks at a higher level (TCP does; UDP does not).

Obviously fixed pass though is an option, but even that isn't without issue. NVIDIA only recently removed the driver restriction, they could add it back at any time. Plus you are limited on virtual machine by the physical GPU count. It works with Intel GPUs and is FOSS with them.  SR-IOV on Intel fixes all of that. It works amazingly well with their iGPUs, has no license issues, and is fully FOSS.",Negative

Intel,"LMAO, I actually have quite a bit of knowledge in this area.  If all you care for is VDI for a small number of VMs, then you'd go GPU passthrough. vGPU / MxGPU often requires higher levels of hypervisor software tier (i.e. VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus), requiring more money. For KVM hosts, setting up vGPU is a lot more difficult and time consuming than just straight up GPU passthrough.  Only two groups of people would be interested in GPU virtualization / splitting:  * Enterprise, in which they wouldn't care about the used card prices.  * Enthusiasts, in which they wouldn't want to pay for vGPU prices anyway. So why bother catering to this crowd?",Neutral
Intel,"Full GPU passthrough is not a solution that many people would consider because it is clumsier than using sr-iov (or potentially VirtIO GPU Venus). Plus for each extra passthrough instance I would have to add in another GPU and this greatly increases power consumption, heat output and cooling requirements. The process is not all that much more complicated at least on Turing GPUs with a hacked driver on KVM guests at least. Plus for passthrough, you probably still need an NVIDIA card because last I checked AMD cards still had a random kernel panic issue after being passed through.  My assumption is that sr-iov on the b50 will allow users an affordable way to have multiple guests on one host GPU without increasing power draw and paying for expensive alternatives and expensive vGPU subscriptions.",Negative
Intel,"...first time I heard people prefer SRIOV over GPU passthrough because it's ""clumsier"" lol. I'm sure setting up mdev devices in KVM, finding the correct corresponding GPU instances, making them persistent through reboot, then edit virsh xml for each individual VM is a lot easier than just doing IOMMU passthrough. /s     Again, enthusiasts don't care about power consumption / heat output / cooling requirements for their lab environment. Enterprise that do care about them are very willing to pay extra cost to get a production ready driver. You're creating a hypothetical situation that simply does not exist in the real world.",Neutral

Intel,"The E core having more improvements than just 50% larger L2 is a nice surprise, but damn the efficiency and performance of it is insane. 29% and 22% more performance, at the same power draw is insane, clocking like 6.7% higher too. They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown. As that can probably handle like another extra watt of heat and performance. Battery life is very nice, the fact that it can match other phones with like over 1000mAh bigger battery is funny. As people always flexing over how they have like a 4000, 5000mAh+ battery, of course having a bigger capacity is better, but the fact that Apple is more efficient with it and can have the same battery life at a much smaller battery speaks volumes about it.",Positive
Intel,"The occupancy characteristics of A19 Pro are quite incredible. 67% occupancy for a RT workload.  Look at Chips and cheese's SER testing. 36-44% ray occupancy with SER in Cyberpunk 2077 RT Overdrive.     Assuming NVIDIA can get this working on 60 series an effective a 52-86% uplift. After OMM and SER this seems like the third ""low hanging"" RT fruit optimization. Anyone serious about a PT GPU architecture NEEDs dynamic caching like Apple. And no this is not RDNA 4's Dynamic VGPR, it's a much bigger deal. Register file directly in L1$ has unique benefits.",Positive
Intel,"Nice been waiting for this. P-core frontend improvements and branch, and a wider E-core with it's newer memory subsystem shows great YoY gains as usual. Though I am not surprised since it's been years leading up to this that Apple has steadily have been increasing power/freq to get the rest of it's performance gains, although IPC YoY is still class leading. The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that. The base iPhone 17 looks like a reaaly reallly good option, more than ever, wished they didn't drop the Plus model. But man, I feel like waiting another year, hearing rumours about N2 and new packaging tech excites me.  That said, looking forward to QC, MT, and Samsung.

Intel,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.  Its either Qualcomm or Apple. AMD is too far behind Oryon and Apple's uarchs. They consume similar or even more area for their core architecture while lagging in performance while using significantly more power. The x86 ecosystem and compatibility is the only reason they'd survive Oryon.",Neutral
Intel,Having so many SoC makers on arm competing against each other by one upping each other yearly is bearing fruit vs x86. i don't know how Intel and AMD long term can fare at this rate. Arm CPUs are still showing double digit gains yearly.,Neutral
Intel,Most of apples RT gains are from optmsiing how the GPU deals with divergence.  This is not dedicated RT silicon so much as making the GPU be able to maintain much higher throughput when there is lots of divergence.  RT operations have a shit tone of divergence.,Negative
Intel,I can't wait to see die shots and measurements for these chips. The A18 Pro and A18 die shots were really interesting to see what was compacted or lost for the base model chip. I have a feeling that there will be bigger differences for the A19 Pro and A19 with that giant SLC on the former. Die areas will also be interesting. Cache isn't cheap for area and I'd also love to see inside the new E-cores and GPU.,Positive
Intel,">Growing the E core into a medium core is really important and something I was worried apple might miss out on, but this means they should be able to keep up in multicore as trends point to flooding CPUs with E cores.  I wouldn't say its a medium core yet tbh. Apple's E cores are still sub 1mm2 in area usage. Compared to other ""M cores"" they are still relatively small. I imagine the A19 Pro E core is fairly larger but the A18 E core was around 0.6/0.7mm2 in size. I'd imagine its not grown a whole lot.  >They really ~~buried~~ deleted the lede by not even mentioning the E core improvements beyond the cache and undersold the GPU.

GPUs are not designed for short running diverging workloads. But RT is exactly that.

So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",Neutral
Intel,"While RT does have lots of branching logic (and CPUs are much better at dealign with this) you also want to shader the result when a ray intercepts, and this is stuff GPUs are rather good at (if enough rays hit that martial)   We have had CPU RT for a long time and so long as you constrain the martial space a little GPUs these days, even with all the efficiency  loss are still better at it.   (there are still high end films that opt for final render on cpu as it gives them more flexibility in the shaders they use) but for a game were it is all about fudging it GPUs are orders of magnitude faster, you just have so much more fp compute throughput on the GPU even if it is running at 20% utilization that is still way faster than any cpu.",Positive
Intel,"Its not just useful for RT but also for a lot of other situations, being able to just call out to functions on the GPU and not pay a HUGE divergence penalty (you still pay some) opens up GPU compute to a load more cases were we currently might not bother.",Neutral
Intel,I'm a bit confused. You think lagging 15% behind in P/W the competition for an entire year is not being a generation behind?  ARM themselves have managed only a 15% jump this year. So it will essentially be 2 years before we get an E core that matches the A19 pro. And this is just considering the Xiomi's SoC. Mediatek's and Qualcomm's which dominate the majority of the market lag even further behind.,Negative

Intel,"I agree to some degree; Geekerwan notes they are testing mainboard power, not core power (if you Google Translate their legend).  For me, I assume all the major power draws on the motherboard *are* contributing to the overall SPEC performance, too.   If the faster LPDDR5X-9600 in the A19 Pro eats more power, it's fair to include that power because ***all*** A19 Pros will ship with LPDDR5X-9600. That was Apple's choice to upgrade to this faster memory.    Now, you're very right: we can't purely blame the uArch at Apple. It may well be the DRAM or the boost algorithms (like we saw at the A18 Pro launch last year) and—at Apple specifically—even the marketing overlords.

Intel,"While the efficiency for this is BAD, I dont think its 20W per core.  When we look at results by [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-zen4-zen4c-scaling/2) we can see \~7-8W per core for this (not great numbers, because its a weird chip and different node), which is still very bad. AMD certainly has some power issues, but many of which, i.e. inefficient I/O dies, are not really dependent on the CPU uArch and could switch at any moment. They certainly have much more inefficient chips at the moment than both Apple and Qualcomm. For Zen 6 we expect a major update to the desktop chiplet architectur which could bring some much needed improvements in terms of I/O though.  They have reasonably fast cores, and I think they are not in a terrible position, even though it is far from good. I think what is interesting for AMD to look out for is that they keep moving fast, instead of intel who didnt move fast since like 14nm, and AMD has strong cores. Additionally AMD has (including from the datacenter) an enterprise need to make the CPUs more efficient.  So yeah, very bad CPUs efficiency wise. A bit behind, but not terribly on perf per node wise, efficiency on the desktop is an afterthought for AMD, clearly, but they are moving constantly and are improving.

So what will happen first is some data will be evicted from cache and those bits will be used as registers.   maybe that shader has a typical width of just 5 registers and only in some strange edge case goes all the way up to 30.

TSMC claimed 25-30% power savings from N7 to N5 and another 30-35% from N5 to N3.  Using these numbers, we get these 4 E-cores using somewhere around 6-7w PEAK, but this is all-core turbo. Intel's CPU at it's most efficient 12w configuration won't hit it's 4.4GHz turbo required to win in single-core performance and is going to hit closer to its 1.2GHz base clock in all-core sustained performance at which point the E-cores not only have their giant IPC advantage, but double the clockspeed too.

You will also use this mixed martial uber shader to use up all the dregs that do not fit within a SMD group.      Eg you might have 104 rays hit a martial but that martial shader can only fit 96 threads into a SIMD group so has 8 remaining thread, you don't want to just dispatch these on there own as that will have very poor occupancy (with 88 threads worth of compute ideal) so you instead inline them within a uber shader along with a load of other overflow.",Neutral

Intel,"Your CPU is fine – a 13700KF isn’t holding you back in Warzone/BF. The weak link right now is the RAM. You’ve got 32GB of DDR4-3200, which is pretty slow for that chip. Swapping to a 32GB kit of DDR4-3600 CL16 is cheap and will help 1% lows and overall smoothness.  On the GPU side: even though you “only” see ~80% usage, it can still be the limiter. GPU usage is an average – it can spike to 99% in microbursts, and as long as GPU frame time is higher than CPU frame time, the GPU is what’s capping FPS. In practice, if the GPU is consistently loaded more than the CPU in a game, you’re effectively GPU-bound.  If you want more FPS right now, a 4070 Ti Super or 4080 Super is the logical upgrade. If you’re not in a rush, you could skip a mid-cycle upgrade and wait for a 50-series card (5070/5080/5090) once prices settle – that’ll be a bigger jump per dollar than going from a 4070 to another 40-series card today.  Also, the HYTE Y40 looks great but can be a bit tight on GPU airflow. Adding a couple of bottom intake fans blowing at the GPU is a cheap tweak that helps temps and lets the card hold higher boost clocks.  TL;DR: – Keep the 13700KF – Upgrade RAM to 32GB DDR4-3600 CL16 – You’re still effectively GPU-limited even at ~80% usage – Options: 4070 Ti Super / 4080 Super now or wait and jump to a 50-series (5070/5080/5090) – Add bottom intake fans for better GPU airflow",Neutral

Intel,"Game's don't use many cores, so CPU usage stays low even when you are cpu limited",Neutral
Intel,"40% utilization on OP's 13700KF can mean there are 4-6 cores that are at 100% utilization.   Most games barely use 6 cores so a CPU that has 16 cores like OPs CPU, a CPU doesn't have to hit 100% utilization in order to be CPU-limited.   Many games behave this way because they are primarily CPU-bound and there really isn't anything you can do about it.   OP upgrading to a 13900k or 14900 MIGHT help, but the performance improvement is going to be so low that it will never actually justify the cost of upgrading.",Neutral
Intel,Excellent bang for buck with drivers getting better and better.,Positive
Intel,They're good if it's a decent bit cheaper than the 9060 xt.  You also need a fast CPU since the b580 scales with how good/bad your CPU is.,Positive
Intel,"Are you buying brand new or used? If you are considering new, I would suggest going used instead as you can get a better card for the same amount of money as a new B580.",Neutral
Intel,I mean it's alright. It's got 12GB of VRAM which is cool I guess but XeSS is not that great compared to DLSS 4 and FSR 4 these days and the performance is slower than a 5060 or 9060 XT 8GB.,Negative
Intel,"I have a B580 linked up to a 4K TV. The only quirk I've really noticed is that changes in resolution, refresh rate or HDR on/off will occasionally cause the TV to hard reboot. I'm not sure if this would happen with a regular PC monitor, but this never happened with the previous GTX 750 Ti I had.  Otherwise performance in games is as expected from reviews. I don't play AAA games in 4K with it, but haven't had crashing issues that some people report.",Neutral
Intel,"with how bad GPU pricing is slated to be due to the memory shortages, I'm starting to consider a B580 so I can at least have a GPU that should be able to play BeamNG in 3440x1440. not keen on having to replace it within less than three years though, but maybe I'm severely overestimating how much GPU I actually need in a realistic gaming scenario. the used market here has been rather dodgy as of late.",Negative
Intel,"I'm happy with my B580. It runs games in 1440p with frame generation, was the best option for this price.  Come visit r/IntelArc to learn more.",Positive
Intel,"That's their problem. Intel cards are fine, but AMD cards are priced almost the same and they are more reliable.",Neutral
Intel,i never buy used hardware. it doesn't feel good,Negative
Intel,"don't know what op's monitor is. if op is going to connect the pc to a tv, tv usually has upscaling function and we do not need the upscaling algorithm in the gpu",Neutral
Intel,"B580 changed everything.... For the six months until AMD released 9060XT.  I hope they keep making GPUs tho. B580 is seriously impressive for the price, but they've got so much catching up to do.",Positive
Intel,"Agree, the only high ticket items i buy used are things i can physically fix myself such as cars and bikes",Neutral
Intel,"You are incredibly misinformed. TV upscalers are nothing like DLSS and FSR.  A TV's upscaler really doesn't work all that well in gaming one because they generally don't really make games running at 1080p look like 4K since that's what most TVs are nowadays and this is coming from someone with a 4K Samsung.  Also DLSS and FSR improve performance, reduce motion blur, give better anti aliasing than regular TAA all of which a TV upscaler doesn't do.   Also TV upscalers introduce extra processing lag from the upscaling which DLSS and FSR straight up lower latency because of the performance uplift.",Negative
Intel,"It's technically slower than even the 9060 XT 8GB which is usually around the same price give or take 20-30 bucks. I wouldn't call it ""seriously impressive for the price"" at all it's only saving grace is having 12GB of VRAM but it's got iffy drivers, cpu overhead and a worse upscaler.  It's not impressive at all. It's decent at best. It's cool that it has 12GB of VRAM and that might matter in a handful of games at 1080p at maxed out settings or matter more in 1440p but it really lacks reasonable performance to play the latest games in 1440p without relying on upscaling which it has been surpassed by in FSR4",Negative
Intel,"oh thank you so much for the info. i'd look into that. i'm using a samsung 65"" 4k tv and i usually output 1440p from the gpu via hdmi to the tv and let the tv do the upscaling thing. i'd try enabling the upscaling in gpu and output 4k to the tv and see if i could spot the difference",Positive
Intel,>around the same price give or take 20-30 bucks.  Not the case at all where I live lmao. More like a 100 euro difference between a piece of shit 8gb vram card and the B580.,Negative
Intel,Cheapest b580s are 250 here. Cheap 9060 XT 8GBs are like 270. The b580 is pointless imo.,Neutral
Intel,"Cheapest B580s are 250 here, the cheapest 9060XT 8gbs are 340. Ergo, B580 is not pointless. Simple stuff.",Neutral
Intel,It's pretty pointless to pay 20 extra less bucks for a card that performs worse.,Negative
Intel,r/buildapcforme,Neutral
Intel,"What are your struggling scenarios that you want to upgrade almost the whole system? Games are not that hard to operate, except if you want absolute graphics quality.",Neutral
Intel,"Coffee Lake is old at this point, and there isn't really a good upgrade path. Even the top dog of that era the 9900k is quite slow by modern standards, and will be a bottleneck for most mid to high end GPUs. I guess you can choose to upgrade just the GPU alone and stick with the 9600k. Just know that in CPU limited games, you most likely will see a substantial CPU bottleneck.",Negative
Intel,"The main thing I am coming across is titles like Monster Hunter: Wilds, Borderlands 4 etc that are both poorly optimised and CPU intensive. In theory my current specs are right on the ""minimum"" specs to play MH:Wilds, but in practice I get barely a stable 30fps at 1080p, even using upscaling and low settings.    I have contemplated just a GPU upgrade (e.g. picking up a 30series GTX), anything newer and I assume I'll end up severely CPU limited. But then I still have a 6 generation old CPU and a few generation old GPU, so probably land in the same situation with the next generation of games. And a 3060 new still costs almost as much as a B580 or RTX5060, so doesn't seem cost effective.",Negative
Intel,That's why I'm contemplating a full CPU/mobo/GPU upgrade and keeping the ram/SSD/PSU.    Its just not clear to me what a good GPU match for a 13-14 gen i5 (or equivalent AMD) would be so I can keep my RAM. Or even whether it's a good idea at this point to hold on to my RAM (e.g. should I just wait until I can afford a newer system and go full DDR5?,Neutral
Intel,"There are 2 things we can probaly do:  1. Tweaking this old system to squeeze the most out of it for best performance at stable state while gaming. You won't get significant improvements but in other hand, it is free. Your risk is the temperature and voltage. 2. Generational upgrade that cost us minimal changes with most reusable parts.",Neutral
Intel,"Well, there's also the problem that your RAM 2666 is pretty slow for DDR4. Also, whether it's AM4 Zen3 or 12/13/14th gen, you're basically investing in a OLD platforms that's not only slower than modern AM5, but also has no future.   Honestly, i'd stick with Coffee lake at this point, maybe see if i can swap to a 8700k for cheap, and go with a low end GPU like a 5060 or B580 and deal with the CPU issues until prices normalize.",Negative
Intel,"Thanks, that makes sense. I kind of suspected that while my RAM and SSD were compatible with newer systems, but not actually very good anymore (given they weren't exactly cutting edge 7 years ago when I got them) - but it's good to confirm that.   I think I'll look around for cheap/second hand GPU options and otherwise wait around until I can afford a complete system update.",Positive
Intel,"No problem. Your SSD is decent, if a bit smaller capacity. I had this exact same model and it's in my dad's pc right now. 500GB is still ok for a system storage drive if u don't have a ton of stuff. Gen 3 speeds are still more than enough for daily use imo. You'll still need a extra SSD for games if you don't have that.   As for the ram, you could see if u can overclock it to 3000 mhz. If you don't mind used, then it's ok to migrate them to a AM4 b450/550 platform and maybe pair it with a Ryzen 5 5600x . You can probably get the pair for around $150-200 used and elevate some CPU performance issues you'll have. Granted, what I said about investing in old platforms with no future still stands, but if the price is right and you really need the increased CPU performance, then it could be justifiable.",Positive
Intel,"Arc B580 is a good budget card and leagues better then a 3050, just note it will probably struggle on high settings on 1440p. On tomshardware it scored 42.6 FPS on average for 1440p Ultra Rast which included God of War Ragnarök in there game selection.   If you want to play high settings consistently without frame gen at 1440p, I would spend the extra $100 for the 9060XT 16GB. It scored 40% higher then the B580, and cost 40% more. So you're getting same value wise, for price to performance 1440p Ultra.  Also note, Intel GPU's are still new and have the most vary performance with time,  so I would actually imagine the B580 is a bit better then the recorded benchmark I'm refrencing from.

Intel,"The B580 will about 90% faster (assuming no CPU bottleneck). But, if you can afford it, the Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB is about 160% faster and can usually be found for about $350 in the US.",Positive
Intel,"Depends on pricing, the B580 is a decent deal in the UK, you can get it here for £200 and a choice of a £60 game out of four options including BF6 so a no brainer for budget builders. Anymore than £200 or the dollar equivalent id just jump to a 5060 or better yet 9060XT 16gb. There will be some CPU bottleneck, but you can get alot of performance out of itself still.",Positive
Intel,More ram because this is a amazing build,Positive
Intel,"Get fast 32GB DDR4 RAM (or even more). The rest of the build is well balanced and upgrade meaning completely new system (except PSU and storage). The GPU still good, but produce less fps in new games compare to 5070Ti (own both - personal experience).",Positive
Intel,RAM 32GB (16 * 2),Neutral
Intel,Buy a new case and PSU and move your old parts to the new case together with your son. Get yourself more modern computer parts. That's my plan.,Neutral
Intel,"Crazy, that's practically the same setup I have... But sadly most of it is pretty much outdated and ""used"" by you - therefore not future proof. So it definitely makes sense to configure a new PC and build it (maybe together with your son) yourself. For around 700-800$ you can get a decent setup that will be futureproof and cost-efficient.",Negative
Intel,"Can go either way. If you see yourself continuing to play AAA games in the next 2-3 years, I would just hand down your current PC to your son. Since he doesn't play AAA games much and assuming his playing on 1080p (For 1440p non-AAA / non resource-intensive games will still work fine with your setup) Same time you could future-proof and get a new medium-end setup for yourself on the AM5 platform, without spending too much although RAM prices are through the roof right now.",Neutral
Intel,"I don't know what everyone's fascination is with the newest greatest thing right now. But, it is unrealistic for many to obtain. Honestly any CPU upgrade 5700 or better. Will have noticeable gains in smoother game play. A newer GPU paired with said CPU will have a big improvement.",Positive
Intel,"I know what I'm planning to do, build a new pc for myself with my son, then upgrade the motherboard and processor, and cooler, and case then build that with him. Somewhere down the line when he needs a better GPU I'll upgrade that for him. Thank you all for helping with a silly question but it has been on my mind lately, soon he will be into games with me, I can only play so much roblox and Minecraft (seriously burnt out on MC) but again thank you everybody",Positive
Intel,"Upgrade/build a new PC for yourself, and give the old parts to your son.",Neutral
Intel,I just built a new one to continue playing the AAA that I am into and I handed down my older to the kids  Its a AMD 5800x and a 2070super which works fantastic for most games especially Minecraft and RoBlox,Positive
Intel,Ram prices are bad but if it doesn’t matter to you I’d get a new pc with am5 and give your son your current one,Negative
Intel,I was thinking the same thing. I dont want just give him my whole setup. I want him to have his own case style and rgb,Neutral
Intel,Second this. OPs specs are really close to my dad's current computer (r5 3600+2060)! He usually gets to upgrade with my old gear since he's only typically using it for browsing and media consumption. I did get him a new case (Montech XR Wood) and new used cooler (AMD Wraith Prism). Computer is plenty powerful for his needs.,Positive
Intel,"So then I should basically build myself a new pc? I was always planning on building the next one with him either way, just to express how important every piece of equipment is",Neutral
Intel,"I dont see myself playing tons of AAA titles in the future just currently im playing arc raiders and bf6, which seem to be the most graphic heavy currently in my library. I do think I should future proof soon at some point, just not now until ram goes down a tad",Neutral
Intel,Yes i mean I dont need anything crazy like a 5070ti just something I dont need to worry about for another 5 years,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah RAM is bad right now, I dont need to build ASAP Thank-you",Negative
Intel,"Exactly. And maybe there is a M.2 or power supply in your current PC that you can use for your new PC. And for your son, it is a valuable lesson. But I would wait a few weeks because RAM prices are hella expensive atm",Neutral
Intel,"Honestly get a 5700/x or better for the CPU.  Maybe a rx 9060 xt. But there is many GPU options. 3070 ti, 3080, rx 6800 xt ect. Just get a newerish GPU of a high tier or the newest mid low tier. All will be more than adequate.  I'm still using a gtx 1080, but I also haven't seen a game worth playing in the last however many years.",Neutral
Intel,"The 7600X doesn't come with a cooler, you have to buy one separately.  Air cooling would be fine for it.",Neutral
Intel,"First time building, so excuse if im asking stupid questions. So I need one cooler for the processor (the one you put on top of it) and thats it?",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, that is all you would need.  The only other thing would be case fans, but the case you selected comes with those.",Neutral
Intel,Thanks very much,Positive
Intel,1000% stay on AM4. You already have the MB and - more importantly - the RAM which are very expensive to upgrade right now.      You will be way better off with a 5070Ti. and saving the money. If you really want to spend the extra $400 I would buy an OLED monitor and you'll have a GREAT experience.,Positive
Intel,"Agreed with the other comment, stick to AM4 for now. You can grab a 5800X/XT and get most of the way to AM5 performance, keep your RAM, get the power supply and better GPU, and still come out under the cost of that pre-built and get better game performance almost across the board.",Positive
Intel,"Same, but I’d use that 400$ for a 5800x3d instead (especially if ur cpu is bottlenecked/reaching its limit) - just make sure ur psu can handle that",Neutral
Intel,lowkey what I wanted to hear haha. cause I'm really leaning towards the 5070 TI options. like upgrade is huge to my 3070. but all my buddies are telling me to get a new pc (it's better for future proofing...etc)    that's why I got a little hesitant. the extra money I'll probably use to get an AIO cooler cause rn I'm using a cheap air cooler.    thanks!!,Positive
Intel,"thanks! probably will go with that! minus the cpu upgrade, I'll upgrade later with AM5.",Positive
Intel,"The X3D chips are crazy expensive now due to high demand. \*Maybe\* could be worth it when compared to buying RAM now, but typically its more worthwhile to just go AM5 at that point. In OPs case, getting a 5800X would be significantly cheaper but only if they really need the upgrade. The 3900XT is still pretty good.",Neutral
Intel,"What's the point of future-proofing if you're never going to capitalize on it? Your current pc was future-proofed for upgrades when you got it, and that future has come!   ALso realistically you don't need an AIO cooler either. If you really think your air cooler is holding you back, the coolers by thermalright are extremely good for their cost. $35-$40 gets you essentially the performance as a good AIO. I would only recommend an AIO for looks.",Neutral
Intel,"Oh ok mb, u sound like u know more than me on this",Neutral
Intel,"I won't be facing much bottlenecking, right? that's like my only fear.",Negative
Intel,"In short, no it's perfectly fine.   It is 100% the right move to go for the 5070Ti.",Positive
Intel,thanks a lot!,Positive
Intel,12600K is better.  If you can stretch the 14600K hit 170 on Black friday. It might drop back tomorrow.,Neutral
Intel,Absolutely. Even consider i5-14600k (altho price just went up but can go as low as 165),Neutral
Intel,"If you’re in the US, Newegg has a Gigabyte B650M motherboard on sale for $110 and it comes with 16gb DDR5.",Neutral
Intel,Save as much cash as possible reuse ram if you can. 12600k is decent bro.,Positive
Intel,"My brother, how much would you part your old cpu and mobo out for? My 14 yr old 3750k is tired boss.",Neutral
Intel,They perform similarly. I don't think it is worth paying an extra 140 bucks just for the opportunity of spending more money in the future on a CPU upgrade.,Negative
Intel,12600K. RAM prices are through the roof — upgrade to AM5 later,Neutral
Intel,Get an x3d,Neutral
Intel,Right now I’m only seeing them for 220+,Neutral
Intel,Ohhh that’s a good deal,Positive
Intel,Deal is sold out now 😒,Neutral
Intel,"I was thinking the same, the 12600kf is very similar to 7600x performance wise. And should last a while",Neutral
Intel,Yeah agreed think I’m gonna try to get a 14600k tomorrow,Neutral
Intel,"I noticed, which is 10-15USD above what they were pre Black Friday.  It's a ploy so that if it drops back to 200ish or lower (169.99) they can say ""20% discount"".  Just look out tomorrow.",Neutral
Intel,"Chrck tomorrow on ""cyber monday""",Neutral
Intel,There was also another motherboard that had free ddr5 for am5 if you wanted a better mobo. It's from one of daniel owens new videos. Think it might've been an asus b850 max wifi.,Neutral
Intel,But the 7600x is on AM5 which would allow you to upgrade to best gaming CPU available if you want. Do you really want to be stuck on an Intel platform that maxes out with the 14900k which has had nothing but issues?,Neutral
Intel,Yea you can then upgrade bios and slam a 12900ks or 13700 or 14600k later on. I have 14500 and I love it.,Positive
Intel,"Given the ramp prices, I wouldn't even consider buying a DDR5 platform at all!  Two days before the whole thing (there were enough news videos that it would happen like that) I shot a cheap 64GB for €225 in white so I'm safe :)",Neutral
Intel,"Regrettably, given the current situation, that's probably the best choice to make, rn.  Think of it as a cheap, interim upgrade, that'll carry you to the next gen stuff in a year and half from now.. and IMO, by then, the AI bubble will have popped, and RAM prices will be sane again.  Next-gen will likely be worth it, too. Rumors about Zen 6 especially, make it out to be a beast. Ofc, rumors may turn out to be false.",Positive
Intel,The seem to be sold out everywhere ?,Neutral
Intel,"That the prices it was, I am not surprised. It was already the best value around and the price drop made it a no brainer.  Walmart has it a stupid high price but i expect will drop tomorrow.  Microcenter has it as sub 200USD.",Negative
Intel,"Can't talk about worth without knowing the prices.  If you can sell the 5600X for $200 and buy the X3D for $220, fuck yeah do it.  If it costs you $300 and you only get $40 from selling the old one, fuck that.",Negative
Intel,I've got a 5700X3D with the non-XT 9070 and they're fairly evenly balanced in most games at 1440p. You may still have a CPU bottleneck in some games with the XT.,Neutral
Intel,I was in the exact same position as you (5600x+3070 to 9070XT). I figured I’d start with just the gpu and just play my games and see if I notice any bottlenecking. So far I’ve seen no need to change the cpu.,Neutral
Intel,"Stay with the 5600x, its perfectly fine at 1440p with a 9070xt. If you do 1080 the 5600x will bottleneck the card but at 1440p it barely matters.",Neutral
Intel,"5600X is fine. The am4 X3D chips are just too expensive now. If you really want to maximize am4, get a 5700X/5800X/5800XT",Neutral
Intel,This,Neutral
Intel,How has performance been with the 9070XT vs the 3070? Happy with it?,Neutral
Intel,"The card itself has been great (XFX swift), performance with FSR4 has been very impressive. I do think I need to revert from the Nov drivers as since updating I’ve been getting driver timeouts specifically with unreal engine games. But before that it was running everything beautifully.",Positive
Intel,Have you uninstalled previous gpu drivers with ddu?,Neutral
Intel,What are your GPU and CPU usage?,Neutral
Intel,No I have not but will try this,Neutral
Intel,"I wouldn't get a 5k monitor primarily for gaming. They're difficult to drive in games at high framerates. They're primarily for use in productivity tasks that require a lot to be showing on the screen at the same time, like video editing. 4k is as high as you want to go for gaming, and you want a pretty high end graphics card (the 5080 you picked is good) to go along with it. Maybe on the very highest end graphics cards you can get good framerates on the ultrawide 2160p display, but I wouldn't do it unless I was going to pair it with a 5090.",Neutral
Intel,"The 5080 is a good card, but may struggle with a 5k monitor for gaming.   Personally I'd recommend an alienware 3225qf monitor.

Intel,"64gb ram is way overkill for gaming, makes even less sense with the current ram price. You are fine with a 2x16 Kit. Saves about 2-300$",Negative
Intel,"I see you went overboard on few things and underestimated a few others.  You don’t need a 5k monitor, since your husband primarily uses the pc for gaming I’d suggest going with a 4K monitor, while the 5080 is a competent card, it’s not a 4K ultra card at modern AAA titles, he should have a decent experience with dlss quality or balanced setting.  Also 64gb ram is overkill in the current market, you could use the extra money on a better aio, psu, or hell even more storage as you can never have enough.  I’d personally go with a more thick thermal paste like the arctic mx-6 while the kryonaut is a good thermal paste it’s suited for much more extreme cooling solution. You can also upgrade your cooler to an aio which will run cooler and quieter, while the peerless assassin is an excellent air cooler, aio’s are better for noise level.",Negative
Intel,"Duronaut is better and longer lasting than kryonaut.   9800x3d hits 150 watts, a peerless assassin 120 is on the weak side for that, at least get a peerless 140 over the 120, but I'd go for an arctic freezer 3 360mm aio instead of air   Might as well get a platinum 1000w power supply instead of a gold 1050w. The system as it stands can safely be powered by a 750w, but a good 1000w gives you more headroom and room to upgrade the GPU.",Neutral
Intel,"I see 2 potential issues:  \* The Windforce variant is a budget build (the cooling, not the card speed etc.) and has had issues with fans and thermal paste across various card models.  Try go for an Asus Prime or Asus TUF variant for better build quality (the TUF > Prime ... dont bother with the ROG Strix cards, it's overkill). - but keep in mind that the Fractal North case has a max GPU length of 355mm (which is plenty), so it needs to be taken into account when selecting a card. The windforce you chose is 305mm.  \* Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut isn't meant for >80°C temps and will harden quickly, requiring replacement within months. It's aimed at pro's who focus on cooling and who swap out paste often. Get something like Arctic XM-4 with a shelf life of 8 years and he'll never have to touch it again.  \* You don't need an 870 motherboard if you're not going to be using all of its features. It's severe overkill with money that could be spent better elsewhere...especially when the M.2 harddrive you selected is PCIe4 - so it won't even be using all of the motherboard's available speed. Best to get something more appropriate and then maybe put that money into a PCIe5 M.2 drive like the Kingston Fury Renegade or Corsair MP range. It will mean faster reading and writing speeds (although how much of a practical difference that makes could be up for debate).  Otherwise, basically what everyone else said (the 4k screen & 32GB ram is more than fine) ... also with a cheaper 4k screen, he can always buy a 2nd monitor to match without breaking the bank. (I'm currently running 2x 32"" 1440p monitors and could never go back to 1 screen - even if it was larger).

Intel,"A770 Owner here. Was between 4060-7600XT-A770 this year, video games was a second focus but wanted to go more for productivity (in a budget). 4060 was fine, but the 8gb VRAM make me go for the other 2 options, mainly if I get to edit very big things in high res., it would be hard to do.  And between 7600XT and A770... The A770 gets 4070 performance on video edition, and Intel codes are far better than AMD. Gaming performance they are almost the same... So far very happy with my purchase.  Since the start of the year, doing the same workflow, with driver updates I got to shave a total of 5 minutes on each video render. At the start was 20m, rn is 15m with the same type of edition. And driver bugs? 0, enever needed to reinstall drivers.",Positive

Raised a support ticket and in a month they fixed it.",Positive

Intel,"A770, really liked it for it's price point, even though it was a pain at first. Solid at 1440p.   I'll get the b780 if it ever releases.",Positive
Intel,I've got the A770 16 gig and it seems fine.  Hard to tell with games if it's my GPU or the game being next gen ready. I came from a gtx 970 so it felt like a massive upgrade. I remember Balder's gate being real low fps in act 1 on the 970 but very decent on the A770 at 1440. Hunt showdown also gets 90+ fps in busy areas but has had issues dropping to very choppy fps when things are happening close. With Hunt it's very hard to tell what the issue is as it has frequent issues that effect many gpus at the same time. Like a friend playing on amd had different issues at the same time as I did. Honestly couldn't tell you if I've turned the graphics up from low since I had that issue. A770 runs armored core 4 really well to the point that I haven't had to mess with any settings or check fps.,Positive

Intel,"Got an Arc B580 for the price/performance ratio, coming from an RX 5700 XT. Was a good bit of an upgrade in a lot of newer games. Honestly think it's a great card for that purpose.  Unfortunately, I ran into poor performance that was a no-go for me. Yakuza Kiwami had a huge issue (ran at like 50-55 fps with horrible lows that made it jittery, while my 5700 XT easily pushed 144, which makes sense, it's basically a PS3 era engine with better assets). From what I can tell, 0, Kiwami 2, and YLAD all had the same issue, and they got fixed over the course of a few years. The problem with that is that 0 was reported on the forum like 2 years before it was fixed. I was in the middle of a playthrough and couldn't just wait for reasonable, playable performance. I even tried DXVK and got a big boost (like 90-100ish), but it was still very unstable.  So you really do have to beware of older games still, despite the drivers having improved a lot and being overall solid. Some other DX11 titles ran perfectly fine though.  OpenGL performance? Forget it. Necesse uses Java and OpenGL and I managed about 70fps before using Mesa for Windows to get a boost. Still wasn't ideal compared to my 5700 XT, once again (and AMD isn't known for OpenGL performance on Windows lmao).  So overall, I think it's a great piece of hardware with mostly solid drivers, but it's not good enough for me on the driver side and I don't want to wait. It lasted 2 weeks before I returned it and got a 9060 XT 16GB (which is again a good bit of an upgrade from the B580, so the extra cost doesn't hurt as bad. I've been waiting for so long for an upgrade that made sense to me).  This was all in the middle of last month. Got my 9060 XT on the 30th.  I'd also like to note that they did alleviate most of the CPU overhead issues recently, so my 5600G wasn't an issue in games that did run well, like The Finals (actually ran extremely well with maxed out settings, and XeSS is actually really good on the Arc cards).",Positive
Intel,"If I haven't got the RTX4060 LP, I would definitely vuy the B580",Positive

Intel,Replaced my 5700xt with a b580.   Performance is equal or slightly better at 1440p ultrawide.  The 5700xt was running out of VRAM in some games though and I was having very frequent driver crashes too.  The b580 has actually been a smoother experience.  The 5700xt has moved into a pc that had a 1050ti so it loves on being a very capable 1080p card,Positive

So the partnership allows Nvidia to, instead of selling a GPU chip to a motherboard OEM to be soldered, will now sell that chip to Intel to be integrated into the SoC package as a chiplet.

Intel,"8 pcie lanes instead of the usual 16 so half the bandwidth for a given generation.  The PCIe bus is used to share information between the card and the rest of the system. It's usually not a bottleneck (the GPU can't process data as fast as it comes in through the bus), but it's a noticeable one when you're low on VRAM and the GPU needs to fetch data in the system RAM through the PCIe bus.

Intel,"No, I don't do a lot. The main goal wa to use it as a display GPU, but the AV1 encoding is a nice bonus. I run OBS in replay mode (10 minutes) in the background and this intel GPU is used for encoding.  I want my Nvidia GPU to not have any monitors connected to it, so I can switch between using it in my host OS and in the VM, here's an example of how it works: [https://youtu.be/3fiXFv85iRU](https://youtu.be/3fiXFv85iRU)  This allows me to for example stream a game directly from a VM to my TV and still use my PC to do something else, like for example few weeks ago we played Trine 2 with my brother, when I was running the game in both the VM and host (one copy on Nvidia and one on Intel) and we played multiplayer together.  I used to use the VM to play everything like year or two ago, but the Nvidia drivers on linux improved significantly, so nowadays I don't use it nearly as much, but I still do from time to time. Plus it's always nice to have a backup plan for running some anticheats.",Positive
Intel,"I'm using looking-glass. It's a bit different than parsec, it works by copying frames from the main GPU's framebuffer into the shared system memory segment and then to the 2nd GPU's memory. No compression and very low latency (I use virtual display in my Windows VM that I can set to 500Hz, which gives me around 2.5ms of added latency in total).  I also use Sunshine and Moonlight when straming to a TV or remotely to my laptop or phone. I have the cheapest server in OVH that I use as a VPN, so I can access my PC or share some services over internet (like my personal cloud for example: [https://cloud.yayuuu.pl/index.php/apps/memories/s/pKqfn86wLLy6xZM](https://cloud.yayuuu.pl/index.php/apps/memories/s/pKqfn86wLLy6xZM) ), so I can game from anywhere, just login over SSH to my home server, wake on lan PC, start a VM and connect using Moonlight).",Neutral
Intel,"Good point, I guess it isn't necessarily the best gaming CPU, but I quite like its speed for compiling etc.  Getting some 5xxx CPU seems like just a small step up and wouldn't be cheap. And anything even higher would mean basically replacing everything: Mainboard, RAM and CPU. Going with a lower core count and higher boosts might be better for gaming, but would feel like too much of a downgrade.  Ironically most games, which I play besides Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, are such old titles, that both GPU and CPU are complete overkill. And lately I found just far too little time for gaming in general to make it worth it with the current prices to get some DDR5.  Edit: I just checked and at least according to Wikipedia the Ryzen 5000 CPUs aren't clocked all that differently. Its successor the 5900X has a boost of 4,8GHz, but same core count and same L3 cache and same TDP.",Neutral
Intel,I don't know what that means in layman's terms. Does it cap bandwidth like older hdmi resolution? Does it limit my kid's Minecraft terrain generation range? Does it mean I only run 69 mods on Skyrim instead of 420?,Negative
Intel,"To be fair I don't play *that* many different games, but I haven't come across one that simply doesn't work. The biggest game compatibility issue I ever ran into was with StarCraft Remastered not rendering at full resolution. My theory is that they were specifically checking for Intel (what would've been only slow iGPUs at the time) and disabling high resolution. Blizzard fixed it though thankfully.

Intel,"Your not a clown, you’re the whole circus buddy",Neutral
Intel,"Wait, if you don't connect your Nvidia to monitors, does that mean the thing you see on monitors is only rendered by the Arc?    So, is it like how you stream from game pass? Where you let other PC run and calculate the game (your VM in this case) and then stream the game on your host OS?    Are there advantages in doing this? How are the graphics compared to directly using your Nvidia?  When you say that you rarely play on the VM nowadays, do you mean your Nvidia is connected to the monitors? Or is there a way to split the task without VM?  Also when you played Trine 2, does that mean the game looks better on TV than your PC? Since Ark is weaker.  Sorry for asking many questions lol",Neutral
Intel,"😂 Just has less bandwidth, but still really damn good.",Positive
Intel,"It caps the bandwidth. But that's fine because it's not strong enough to even utilize the full bandwidth that 16 lanes would provide. And those extra lanes would just increase cost.   This *may* be a problem on an old motherboard, because 8 lanes of PCIe *may* be too little (idk, didn't see any tests). But 8 lanes of PCIe4 are more than sufficient.",Negative
Intel,"You need to change your expectations if that is your point.  If you buy a stick of RAM today, it is going to run at half speed if you don't go into the bios and correct it. If you don't want to tune your PC, don't build one yourself.",Negative

That's basically what laptops are doing this with multiple GPUs. I just set these environmental variables in the steam's launch parameters: DXVK\_FILTER\_DEVICE\_NAME=""NVIDIA"" \_\_NV\_PRIME\_RENDER\_OFFLOAD=1 \_\_GLX\_VENDOR\_LIBRARY\_NAME=nvidia   and it will run on Nvidia. I can do the same with any other app, like browser, blender, etc. The screenshot shows an example of the game running bare-metal on nvidia-gpu and being displayed on intel GPU.  To not repeat the same parameters with every game, I've made a simple bash script that just exports these variables (and few more, like DLSS upgrade, etc), so I just type ""setenv %command%"" in steam lauinch parameters and that's it.  When running a VM, I use looking-glass, which is different than streaming the game to another device over LAN (like in your example with gamepass). Looking-glass uses shared memory to copy frames from one device to another, so it only works within one PC, but the video is uncompressed and with minimal latency (like 2-3ms of added latency). This is essentially the same path as offloading rendering but with one additional limitation - windows forces vsync, so I need to run as high refresh rate inside windows as possible to reduce latency. I use Virtual display adapter that allows me to set up to 500Hz and run desktop without any physical monitors attached.",Neutral
Intel,"Trine 2 is not that demanding, both GPUs can run it at max settings just fine. This is also true with a lot of older games. With new games it wouldn't work like this, but there is another way. Linux has a built-in multiseat, that allows logging in 2 different users at the same time, giving them access to different monitors, input devices, etc. I could use a 4k dummy plug to enable multiseat on that device and stream from there to the TV, but I don't have it configured right now, as I still need VM sometimes, so usually it's enough.",Neutral

Intel,"More like the transmission than the engine. PCIe lanes determine how much compute (horsepower) can get to the CPU (Road) so if your GPU (Engine) is performing really well but is bottlenecked by PCIe lanes, you aren't really getting that level of performance.

Intel,"Not really. If you have a slower cpu (I have a 5600x) DirectX 11 games will run like shit. CS2 for me runs so bad my gtx 1650 almost manages to beat the b580 in all benchmarks I did. Switch over to vulkan, which in cs2's case is very poorly implemented and sucks in comparison to dx11, with visual glitches and crashes being frequently, and the performance improves in almost 30% in all tests I made. This is not the case with any other card. AMD and Nvidia cards will present a drop in performance on cs2 when using Vulkan. The exact same issue is present in squad44 and most other dx11 or older games I tested (Watch Dogs, Far Cry 4, GMOD), as soon as I switch to a newer api like dx12 for Squad or dxvk for those older games, the performance improves drastically. I already reported this problem to Intel in their forums, but so far nothing. I'm not the first one to do so either, so I doubt Intel will fix them anytime soon, if they fix it at all. DirectX 12 and vulkan games run flawlessly, I just finished the remake of silent hill 2 at epic settings and ray tracing on, and the b580 performed really well, even for such a badly optimized game like sh2r. People who are looking to buy one should keep that in mind if they plan on playing dx11 games, especially if they have a slower cpu like my 5600x.",Negative

Intel,"You need to add bodges to Unity which it *really* doesn't like to target hardware below DX10 (SM4.0) - first-party support dropped in Unity 2017.3, and Unreal 4 and up plain will not do DX9. To even make a Unity game work on WindowsXP, you have to enable an OpenGL renderer, which even then requires ICD features only supported on SM4.0 hardware.  If you do target DX9 or DX9Ex, you're really hurting what you can do. You can't use pixel data with vertex data, there's no generic ""This is just FP32"" data type, you can't get antialiasing working right (the driver has to be ""hinted"" and probably won't listen) and you can't read coverage or colour samples. The CPU can't read VRAM in any sensible way, you can't use more than 2 GB of it *and* you have all the limitations Shader Model 3.0 imposes, so very good luck in trying to run any non-immediate shader program.  DX9 does not get the job done. It's debatable whether it did back in the day. It was such a fucking mess that Microsoft just gave up on it and the game would *bundle the goddamned DX9 DLLs with its own executables* because how the hell does a user know if one game needs DX9 August 2004 and and another needs d3dx9\_32.dll but won't work with d3dx9\_41.dll.

I was on a 5600X until relatively recently and used both the A770 and B580 in here for burn-in testing.  If ReBAR is off, DX10/11 games will run awfully. DX12 games will also run worse than they can, but DX12 sees less benefit from ReBAR than DX10/11 does.",Negative

I have the latest bios installed as well, and set my PCIe lane to 4.0. I ran several CapframeX benchmarks, the result is the same no matter what driver version, and it's consistent. If you still have your 5600x and your B580 and you want to see for yourself, CS2 is free, do any sort of benchmarking, you can't miss it, the game runs terribly on DX11 and will magically get 30% more performance on Vulkan, despite CS2's Vulkan being a translation layer afaik, that's why other cards get less fps when using it. Same results so far with every single DX11 or older game, Squad44 is literally unplayable for me on DX11, less than 60 fps at any graphics settings, switch to DX12, and magically I can run it at 1080p high settings at at least 120. As a last effort, I'm thinking about trying to use Windows 11, but I already met someone who has the same issue on CS2 and he's was using Windows 11, so I doubt Windows 10 is the problem. If you have any other ideas, I would love to hear it, but so far I noticed even the benchmarks Intel does in their forums present this issue, but they are camouflaged because Intel run their tests at 1440p and high settings, so in their tests, CS2 runs around 10% slower than the 4060, but no sane person plays a competitive shooter at 1440p high settings, most CS players literally play the game in 4:3 resolusion just to squeeze some frames, which makes the game more CPU bound. So naturally, running the tests at 1440p high settings will mask a potential CPU overhead issue.",Neutral

Then, you should consider the future proof aspect, because the wattage will be a decisive factor for what gpu you will can upgrade in the future. If you think that you will always use low-end gpu's you will be fine with a 650W, but if you plan or want to have the possibility of using mid-range gpu, you should consider a 750W.

Intel,A 5070 should be $500 or right now less.,Neutral
Intel,"Drivers for the most part are good. you will get a hiccup here and there and may have to DDU every once and a while. but they are excellent 1080p cards and fairly decent 1440p cards with optimized settings, usually a mix of high/medium. RT is a mixed bag if you care about it. depending on how it's used it could be great or not great in terms of performance.   CPU overhead is still a thing for the majority of games. AM4 X3D CPUs and the r 7600 and up are what i recommend. on the intel side a 12600k or better.   after writing this out, as you can see i think it's awesome. i just wish it could push out a bit  better as per my own standards. but it wouldn't be a loss to go with it. it's a pretty good card.   I would recommend the LE if you can get it. and avoid acer, i haven't seen one myself but it seems to be the general concusses",Positive

Intel,Did you watch the video? They explain that it’s only on a few titles. And it still has overhead on the fixed titles with certain hardware. Their example used is the r 2600. And even with the 5600 in some cases. Their video title is clickbait.,Negative
Intel,Because that's the few titles that has overhead? Do you even watch it lmao,Negative
Intel,You can head over to the intel subreddit and discord and they’re going to tell you the same thing I did. The overhead issue is not fully resolved. It’s in progress and continues to get better. But it’s not done yet.,Negative
Intel,As opposed to real benchmark data? lmao,Negative
Intel,"it's in the damn data you sent me haha, in rainbow six seige, the R5 2600, it gets a lower result than the 9060xt. it should be about equal to the 9060xt in these scenarios because both GPUs are CPU limited. but the b580 is hit harder because of the overhead issue.  we see this in every single title shown in the video except in dying light 2 and cyberpunk.  the R5 5600 is powerful enough and with the new driver updates able to keep up. we see this in every example shown in the video except horizon zero dawn, even listen to what he says in the zero dawn section. this specific example can be either CPU bound issue, or because the game just loves that X3D cache so much. it's open ended. the driver overhead issue IS better, but it's not fixed.  Anywho, i'm done now, it's time for the weekend. i don't need to try to convince you any more. or i'm just being trolled, it's very possible! I hope you have a nice weekend as well mate.",Negative

Intel,Ok thanks,Positive
Intel,"Because of the current RAM prices, I'd say wait to modernize to AM5/DDR5 until this blows over, or you'll just end up getting ripped off... Idk what an R9 5950X goes for in your area, but that's pretty much the strongest AM4 CPU. Also, Arc Raiders runs on Unreal 5, which still sucks as far as optimization goes. I stay away from Unreal 5 games, if I can.",Negative
Intel,"yeah agree with the DDR5 upgrade will defo be waiting, and yeah i heard Unreal 5 is terribly optimised, i noticed this with the anti aliasing making the game look extremely blurry with no way to sharpen it which is a shame. only new gen game i enjoy so guess ill just have to deal with it",Negative

Intel,"The Arc A750 is basically a RTX3060. It's a good card, and driver updates have made this card a lot more stable than it was at launch.   But yeah 3060 also have more VRAM, so, for 1080p gaming this would be fine.",Positive

Intel,I agree. It was different. Never built an Intel system before. Always been AMD in the past.  I’ve had good experience with a 275HX I use on my laptop so wanted to build an Intel based desktop this time. I especially like the whole idea around the P + E cores and a small NPU.,Positive

Intel,"No. It’s overkill. But I hoped that if I gave it water cooling it would vastly help keep temperatures down so the CPU could hold its boost clocks for much longer.  I have a 275HX with my laptop, it hits 100C in seconds.",Neutral
Intel,"Performance, clock speed, low power.  This is also the first Intel system I’ve built. Always been AMD in the past and fancied a change.  Single core performance was better compared to AMDs equivalent in the price range. I used Copilot to compare a lot of CPUs in the price range and the 225F topped it off for me",Positive

Intel,Disabling ULPS seem to fix the crash. My pc crash pretty often when i wake the screen or turn it on if i dont disable ulps with msi afterburner. 9070xt,Negative
Intel,Doom: The Dark Ages does not lauch with the latest driver. I had to rollback to 25.9.2 in order to play. Please fix,Negative
Intel,Last driver crashes Apex Legends every joined game. Im fuckin over amd.,Negative
Intel,Support for Anno 117: Pax Romana - Incorrect. I have needed to downgrade back to 25.9.2 to play Anno 117: Pax Romana without crashing. The last updates have been a joke. I now cannot use adrenaline due to needing to play on this earlier version to be able to play any new games. Does anyone know of where I can express my complaints?  Edit: This is also the same for Arc Raiders.,Negative
Intel,"Here we go again, jetzt stürzt Battlefield 6 wieder ab. Mit dem Treiber davor hatte ich es in den Griff bekommen außer XMP war aktiviert, dann stürzte es dennoch ab.    Also es scheint definitiv ein AMD Treiber Problem zu sein.    Gut das bei euch die Kunden die Tester sind und nicht ihr das übernehmen müsst.  PS: Gespielt wird mit einer 7900XT und einem 7800X3D.      Das war definitiv meine erste und letzte Karte von AMD. So viel Probleme hatte ich mit Team Grün nicht.",Neutral
Intel,Yeah same here LG c5 42inch 😰,Neutral
Intel,"Having system crash issues after putting the PC into sleep mode. Samsung 57"" Odyssey Neo G9. Now I know who to blame.  Reinstalled AMD drivers and changed the settings so that my PC never gets into sleep mode (turns off the screen, but doesn’t sleep or hibernate). This fixed the issue temporarily for me :(  Also from the system crash minidump, it's very clearly an AMD driver issue  **IMAGE\_NAME:  amdkmdag.sys**",Negative
Intel,"I have this but on display port, HDMI works fine",Neutral
Intel,"DDU with full uninstall of all AMD related things and then chipset driver install, fresh GPU driver install fixed the crash from wakeup for me.",Neutral
Intel,"I had to go back to version 25.9.2 but I no longer have AMD Adrenalin. If I try to install it, it reinstalls version 25.11, which crashes my game. Is it necessary to have AMD Adrenalin? I have a 7900 XTX and a Ryzen 9 7950X3D.",Negative
Intel,Could you try a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter? I wonder if it works in this situation =D,Neutral
Intel,I have the same issue with display port but it’s okay with hdmi :/,Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, I plan to make sure my next display has Display Port in it. Mostly for linux though.",Positive
Intel,"There will already be branching inside the code of the driver. This has been the case already, to various degrees, for years. It's not new.  It's just whether AMD wants to formally spread those branches out on a file / compilation level and distribute different packages. And then publicly whether they commit to updating all branches of code or only some.  For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch. Of course, we have very little outside insight into the exact spread of these cases that AMD wants to pay their engineers to work on.",Neutral
Intel,There is a separate code path for specific things bit both are in those combine driver. Its mostly about certain ray tracing extensions   There are also fp8 and fp16 codepaths    People misunderstand and thought its like pre rdna stuff.,Neutral
Intel,"V25.10.2  here… I have both CPU and GPU by AMD and if you download the specific package, they install drivers only for the specific hardware (and they have different dimensions). For installing both drivers you have to download the AutoDetect package.  EDIT: typo",Neutral
Intel,"I'm one of the 5 people still running a Vega 64 and for years we've had a separate driver ""branch"" despite being able to install new Adrenaline versions. Bf6 beta wouldn't run without spoofing my actual internally installed driver, which hadn't been updated since they dropped support.",Negative
Intel,combined again it looks like 🤷‍♂️,Neutral
Intel,the display team are working on this with priority. Hoping to have this out in the next release. There are two similar display issues on their radar which are both P1.,Neutral

Intel,"Are y'all playing on televisions? HDMI isn't really optimal for modern monitors, with DisplayPort being the better spec for computer graphics.  Not criticizing, just curious as to use-case.",Neutral
Intel,You try install last chipset driver ?,Neutral
Intel,"Bummer you're having issues. Hopefully AMD gets it straightened out for you. Out of curiosity, why did you decide to use HDMI on your monitor instead of display port? I thought HDMI was mostly used for TVs nowadays.",Neutral
Intel,So it's the driver that's why that happens 😡 and it's not fixed?,Negative
Intel,Thank you for your service,Positive
Intel,"I've had the ""device_hung"" error and the best drivers are those you are on.   AMD needs a lot of help with their drivers...",Negative
Intel,Any update mate?,Neutral
Intel,"No, radeon drivers update cannot upgrade your CPU so that it would stop bottlenecking your GPU.",Negative
Intel,"Had the same issue, just ddu and reinstall the drivers manually, problem now is with my hardware monitor screen not working, I have an aorus board with an internal hdmi, that is not being detected, will try to reinstall chipset drivers",Negative
Intel,"multi gpu? got the same problem with rx 6400 + 7900xtx. plugging in my secondary display to 7900xtx fixed the issue, but what's the point of secondary gpu if its not working properly...",Negative
Intel,"Workaround:  Win+P and disable the second Monitor in iGPU, then start adrenaline and you can enable the second monitor again  software should be okay then",Neutral
Intel,"I'm the opposite, I just want adrenaline app to stop everytime I right click on desktop or open file explorer.... Bruh",Neutral
Intel,"yeah same, my experience with 25.10 was terrible, had to DDU it once to get back my CPU metrics in Adrenalin, then DDU’d it again to go back to 25.9.2 since games were stuttering.",Negative
Intel,Same.,Neutral
Intel,"Not stable, ddu install 11.1 and lag in old dx11 mmo game(BDO)  Same as 10.2, 9800x3d with 7900xtx, i can keep 144fps in town , 11.1like  fps 60-65 and lag spikes  Im go back to 9.1",Neutral
Intel,"Both 10 and 11 are shit with 7xxx series, myself and most others have gone back to 9.1 or 9.2. Might be alright with the 9070, might not",Negative
Intel,I'm playing it on 7900 GRE with FSR4 INT8 with no issues.,Negative
Intel,na it works the problem only occures when using PathTracing and you are not going to play on an AMD card with PT anyways and especially not a 7700XT,Negative
Intel,"I played recently the latest patch of Cyberpunk 2077 with RX 7700 XT with drivers from February this year, 25.2.1 and had no issues, no stutter, no lag, no crashes, the problem is with path tracing or ray tracing something, you don't have to use that even and it lowers fps probably for very little visual gain.",Positive
Intel,If it still crashes set RTX Global Illumination to Static.,Negative
Intel,"pretty sure anti lag was causing my system to freeze up when in arc raiders on 25.10. turned it on and issues, turned it off and haven't had issues since",Negative
Intel,"Optimizing has nothing to do with fixing crashing, generally, that would be bug fixing.",Negative
Intel,"The only Redstone component that will work through the driver for upgrading existing features (like FSR3 FG) will be ML FG, but only for games that have FSR 3.1.4+(and FSR FG), as they’ve already announced in a GPUOpen article quite a while ago.   Ray Regeneration (RR) and Neural Radiance Cache (NRC) require dev implementation since they’re much deeper in engine code/inputs.",Neutral
Intel,"Does BO7 have ray tracing? Where is that feature mentioned, would be keen to read about it 🤓",Neutral
Intel,"Itll probably work through optiscaler, but a game like indiana jones has locked dlss inputs, so you need dev implementation",Neutral
Intel,"And all my USB devices dropped for a while, far worse experience than the usual double screen flicker & it's done.  Edit: seems like that was because of iGPU driver for my Zen4. In the end and after 6+ reinstalls, I'm stopping on 25.9.1 and have Vulkan working again.",Negative
Intel,What is wrong with CP? Just got my 9070 after 10+ years of nvidia :o   Ah nvm i see it.,Negative
Intel,Ugh,Neutral
Intel,"Most likely when your distro provides a kernel update.  I'd give this a quick read: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-update-and-see-what-graphics-driver-you-have-on-linux-and-steamos/  Pretty much the default is that you will be using the Mesa driver collection and they were last updated yesterday.  The fixes there do not correlate with the ones in this thread (I think).  As long as you are on a ""cutting edge"" type distro then you can expect that update in the next few days/weeks.  If you are on a ""stable"" distro that doesn't update often, you may be waiting a realllly long time.",Neutral
Intel,"Get what exactly? Features? Bug fixes? Optimizations?   Every 2 weeks there are new Mesa driver updates with bug fixes and performance optimizations. As for features, you have to wait a few months for versions with big numbers (25.2 is soon updating to 25.3, adding Anti-lag 2).   Depending on your distribution, you can get these updates faster or slower.",Neutral
Intel,"Linux doesn’t work like windows. You get updates directly via Mesa stack. When your distro provides mesa package update, that’s when you get driver updates, and they’re completely different from windows branch.",Neutral
Intel,just uninstall it I prefer manual check myself.,Neutral
Intel,So AMDs default driver overclocks and doesn’t reflect that in the values?,Negative
Intel,Same issues here i underclocked it but this new update just made it worse,Negative
Intel,ok it is still crashing ... complete reboot :(,Negative
Intel,"I feel like that crash is more on DICE's side, since Nvidia users get the same exact crash, although less often.  I tried everything I saw on the internet, nothing really works. Sometimes I can play for hours on end, other time game just crashes randomly after 10-15 minutes.  I am going to try to downgrade to 25.9.1 and see how it fares, since I remember that driver being really stable for me (6800XT).  Edit: been playing for 4 hours, no crash yet. Never had such a long session without the game crashing.  Will update in the next few days.  Edit 2: haven't crashed once, been playing at least 2 hours every evening.",Negative
Intel,Okay.,Neutral
Intel,I’m hoping Valve’s new steam machine will push them on that since it’s RDNA3 based.,Neutral
Intel,The RT/PT reflections leading to CTDs issue? We're working with CDPR to resolve this - it's not caused by the driver software.,Negative
Intel,"Stuff like this is honestly bugging me.  First AMD card and while it is okay to have some driver issues, stuff like that shouldn't be a thing at all. It can't be that some bugs keep existing for multiple months let alone more than half a year.",Negative
Intel,A much more fundamental thing like playing video in a window without stuttering took 3 or 4 driver updates.,Neutral
Intel,"> One year already...Cyberpunk 2077 not fixed yet.  On year, I did not know.  I was thinking of a 9070XT earlier in spring, but choose... differently",Neutral
Intel,welcome to amd,Neutral
Intel,Yeah hoping it works. I guess the point about crashing with easy anticheat was the fix? Doesn't specifically mention but it was with raytracing enabled I was getting the crash. I suppose we shall find out.,Negative
Intel,"Weird. I was running 10.2 and things were running fine for the most part. I kept getting a pop-up on launch saying there was a known issue with that driver and Arc Raiders though, so I rolled it back to 9.2 and had more issues on that release than the one with the stated problems.  My fan control profile broke and stopped tracking gpu temp so last night I did a clean DDU install back to 10.2.  Of course 12 hrs later the new release drops haha  Hopefully Fan Control continues to play nice if I just update",Negative
Intel,Same. Never even had Ryzen master installed.,Negative
Intel,"I'm receiving the same error in Event Viewer, but I have installed Ryzen Master. Most likely it's also a component of the Adrenalin drivers for system tuning and monitoring.

Intel,I agree.  I also have this issue  Weird is if you turn on amd overlay it fixes itself,Neutral
Intel,"That it did, lol. My only complaint.",Neutral
Intel,"Not a problem on Linux with Wayland. Ever.   Main reason I ditched Windows 11, constant screen tearing and input lag made me go crazy.",Negative
Intel,The new AFMF features were added in 25.10.2 - Still waiting for AFMF 3.0 at this stage,Neutral
Intel,Suggest if you are using powertoys to stop... After their last game update it was crashing left and right. Powertoys was cause. I only crashed once and I believe it was cfeen blanking was cause for that. I was away too long.,Negative
Intel,"Fps drop over time? That's a game issue, it's got a memory leak",Negative
Intel,"What kind of FPS drops? I was having dog shit frame pacing, and hardcore drops to like sub 60 FPS at 1440p medium/high with a 6950XT. I went through every setting and found that anti-lag was the culprit. Once I turned that off it all went away. Then with future frame rendering it got even smoother. Now I can hold 100+ FPS at all times, sometimes peaking over 200 FPS in some scenarios. And frame times are smooth as butter.",Negative
Intel,I’d settle for bf6 going one entire game without drivers crashing the game and freezing pc,Neutral

Intel,"DDU was only ever for switching GPU families, e.g. Nvidia or Catalyst to Adrenalin.",Neutral
Intel,"Sad to say I am having the same issue. Did you find any workarounds, or just downgrade?",Negative
Intel,"You don't need to make it work on Adrenalin, Battlefield 6 already has FSR 4 support integrated into the game, so you don't need to override, just turn off FSR 4 from Adrenalin.",Neutral
Intel,Works on 25.10.2. I have been seeing ppl said it doesn't work on this driver. It also didn't work on 25.10.1 for me as well.,Negative
Intel,Epic version runs just fine.,Positive
Intel,Cyberpunk GOG last version patch runs fine on this driver.,Positive
Intel,"Hey there, can you give an example of how this looks now versus how it's supposed to?",Neutral
Intel,are you able to install driver only with the newest drivers? When i choose minimal or driver only it still install full version of the software anyway. Only 25.9.1 works perfectly.,Neutral
Intel,Yeah... it can happen. I was already locked outside windows after a bsod with my old nvidia card. I had to use a linux usb drive to fix it through the command line.,Negative
Intel,It's most likely the same as I've described here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1ow4in7/comment/nop2o04/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1ow4in7/comment/nop2o04/)  But yeah unfortunately seems like all you can do for now is either roll back to 25.10.2 or disable your iGPU if you don't use it,Negative
Intel,probably because those issues are build specific.  I've not had any freezing or locks on any drivers this whole year.,Neutral
Intel,"The game is booting, this message was for the 25.10 they just didn't removed it",Negative
Intel,I don't know your system specifications but in many cases setting the BIOS to PCIe v4 could help.     Try change in your bios,Neutral
Intel,no I hit alt R opens right away.  And i did an upgrade install over top of 25.10.2 no DDU or AMD clean up utility.  When you say you did a clean install was that just from control panel and remove?,Neutral

Intel,"Wait, chipset drivers uninstall too? I'm going to have to fix that on my system...",Negative
Intel,Do u reintall already up to date chipset drivers?,Neutral
Intel,You should use the Factory Reset installation in the AMD Driver Installer so it removes the newest AMD Adrenalin and install back the correct Adrenalin driver.,Neutral
Intel,"I don't have a DisplayPort to HDMI 2.1 adapter to try, sorry.",Negative
Intel,doing so (separation) will create a freak out shitstorm part 2.,Neutral
Intel,> People misunderstand and thought its like pre rdna stuff.  It is. They've simply bundled two separate drivers together. RDNA1/2 are still stuck on the same 21033.x branch while RDNA3/4 have moved first to 22021.1009 and now 22029.1019.,Neutral

It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.

Intel,"They promised redstone as a feature for 25h2. So if they dont, that could technically be grounds for a lawsuit",Neutral
Intel,ahh i'm on Win 10 so probably why I didn't see it.,Neutral
Intel,Weird. Why is it a Windows fix?   I also got vsync bug in specific games and the weird thing is that I needed to turn on the and perf overlay in order to work,Negative

Kinda miss the improvements for AFMF they brought with 25.10 for other games, but eh I'd rather play BF6 without it crashing randomly.",Negative
Intel,"Didn't test long enough to see if it crashes as I reverted back to old driver when I noticed my gpu was permanently at 100% load which it never was before on old driver, doesn't feel like it's supposed to do that with a 9800x3d & 9070xt + 32gb ram, It's moving between 70-95% usage on old driver",Negative

Intel,"Damn, didn’t work for me last driver either. I can get FSR4 to work in other games just not BF6",Negative
Intel,Sorry for not replying in time with the pictures but I just saw that on Twitter that Beat Saber and AMD are now aware of the issue. The distorted flickering issue on the walls.  https://xcancel.com/BeatSaber/status/1993629046802882685  However there's another issue. I had not actually tried to use an Index at 90Hz until the other day. I discovered that the latency bug is back for 90Hz mode. As in I have to adjust the photon latency to ~5ms in the Steam debug commands to make it usable but not fixed. Just like in the the drivers before 24.12.1.   120Hz mode still works fine.,Neutral
Intel,"Even the rollback doesn't fix it for me now. It being related to the combination of iGPU and GPU makes sense though. Sadly I actively use the iGPU, so thats not an option for me.",Negative
Intel,You 100 procent sure on this?,Neutral
Intel,I went back to 25.3 official gigabyte latest driver for 9070XT OC gaming and 2 days no crashes for now. Also changed HDMI for DP cable  I will also change in BIOS and completely disable integrated GPU in BIOS,Positive
Intel,"I had auto update on (my mistake), so it did install over the previous driver. I've downgraded for now and it seems to be working just fine.  But no, after uninstalling from control panel I booted into safe mod and used DDU.   Then I downloaded the newest installer from the website. Restarting where needed during this process.   Didn't matter how I tried to access the software. Wasn't active in the system tray, not there in task manager.   Right click on desktop and open from there, click the exe, or go into a game and try Alt R. Didn't open with any of these methods.",Neutral
Intel,Driver with -s letter after black screen and reboot PC tells me that this driver isn't for my graphic card🤡,Negative
Intel,Does fsr 4 work on 25.9.1? I thought the only driver that works without having to change any files and risk a ban online is 23. 9.1?,Neutral
Intel,"I had to rollback to driver 25.9.1, start up Star Citizen, switch the renderer to Vulkan, exit game, start SC again to verify it's working with Vulkan, then reinstall the latest driver again. Now it works, just don't switch it back to DirectX. No idea who dropped the ball on this one but Easy-Anticheat sure doesn't like the atidxx64.dll.",Neutral

Intel,What do you mean extension update??? Do you mean lg firmware update or something Ina  windows update? Where do I find this?,Neutral
Intel,They do not.,Neutral
Intel,"Well, I used the system before the latest updates normally, for maybe half a year. Installed every update without DDU. I wanted to triple boot, formated the drive, left windows to install stock updates and drivers, went to install chipset and GPU driver and voila, every wakeup, just before I could type the pin, kernel panic and shutdown. DDU, just the driver, installed again, black screen. Went into DDU again, wanted to see if I missed anything and without reading, uninstalled everything AMD related, went into windows, installed chipset drivers from vendors site (ASUS) and then the latest GPU drivers, and havent had issues. I have a monitor connected via DP and a TV via HDMI.",Neutral
Intel,Dont buy an adapter. Most of them are trash and dont put out the advertised resolution and refresh rate. Not to mention most of them dont support vrr or HDR.,Negative

Intel,"Yes, I’m talking about 25.10.2 (posted the other day here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/s/nNunS1QlFX ). If you go to AMD download page and select “GPU” you get a file that has a different dimension from the one you download if you choose “CPU”. If you do the following steps 1) DDU (or AMD CleanUp Utility), 2) install CPU drivers => GPU not recognized or with a generic driver. If the you install the GPU driver you get the GPU correctly recognized and a yellow esclamation mark on the integrated. To have both VGAs working at the same time I have to download the AMD Auto Detect package (the file name ends with “minimal_install), but Adrenalin App does not open.",Neutral

Intel,"I totally understand. if you're running with an affected display config, you should be fine on 25.9.1 or the 25.10.1 preview driver for BF6. We'll get this out as soon as we can.",Neutral
Intel,"Appreciate you reaching out with this - that's an interesting data point to consider.  In this case, the quirky behaviour with HDMI 2.1 + FRL was attributed to a change made in the display stack, I don't think it explicitly involves display stream compression to repro, just high enough display bandwidth (though I could be mistaken)",Positive
Intel,"Interesting. I've been experiencing random BSODs on my PC too on a fresh Win11 install too, I was also suspecting it was something to do with auto HDR toggle but I didn't know for sure.  I'm running 180hz 1440 LG panel but I don't recall if it's using hdmi or DP. I've also never experienced BSODs until the last week or two, since i did a fresh install and I've had the same monitors/PCs for a long time.",Neutral

Intel,Thank you! Exciting keen to see what it’s like,Positive
Intel,"It has nothing to do with the lack of vulkan support, even when fsr4 comes to vulkan, the game still needs ray regeneration implementation from the devs, you cant use optiscaler through dlss inputs, like you probably will be able to in fx alan wake 2",Negative
Intel,I suppose is going to be fixed as soon as Amd Redstone go out. Basically is going to add every tecnology that Path tracing needs to work. Off course the devs would have to implement them in the game too,Neutral
Intel,"The issue is if you try to use path tracing. Which to be fair, you probably shouldn't unless the miracle of them getting Virtuous to implement Ray Regeneration in Cyberpunk happens.",Negative
Intel,yes i tried it ... maybe it is because of the 7800X3D ... i really dont know... i will wait for the next patch ... should come tomorrow 18.11. ... but i have read so many threads and i am not the only one...,Neutral
Intel,Hmm fair. For me on 9070XT if I had raytracing enabled it would crash most regularly on loading back to the menu after extraction which was annoying but at least not game destroying lol. But yeah annoying enough that I turned RT off entirely.   I hope this means I can turn it back on because the game runs well enough for it.,Negative
Intel,"Yes. So far, so good. I'm not 100% sure what fixed it.      I uninstalled both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master standalone applications. Deleted the ""amdryzenmasterv"" keys. Rebooted.  Then I installed Adrenalin and used the Ryzen Master installer in Adrenalin (Performance > Metrics > Install Ryzen Master).  I think this problem might have something to do with a handshake breaking between Ryzen Master and Adrenalin, after upgrading just Adrenalin.   From now on, I'll probably do clean installs, removing and reinstalling both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master, through Adrenalin Performance tab.",Positive
Intel,"My last two processors are ryzen amd, my last three video cards are amd radeon and next one will be amd also, nvidia has driver issues as well, to be honest.  But yes, some issues are too annoying and updating drivers is lottery at this point. I would advice against updating drivers unless you need it for specific new game or have the latest video cards - rx 9070 \[xt\]  or 9060 xt .  I should have sold the 7700 xt and bought 9060 xt 16gb instead but too late for that now and it has problems as well, so lottery as i said, its a risk.",Negative

Intel,OK I will install it now and test it and get back to you. Give me 10 mins.,Neutral
Intel,Yuppp. It does not work on bf6 but it works on ark survival ascended for me. Seems it might be a bf issue. I saw ppl saying they were getting more fps with this driver in BF6 but I think they didn't realize it's using FSR 3.1 and not 4.,Negative
Intel,I'll work with the engineer from that ticket check if that issue has somehow regressed.,Neutral
Intel,We've not been able to reproduce this internally so far. Can you remind me which GPU (was this a 7900XTX?) + connectivity method you're using?,Neutral
Intel,Try using DDU to uninstall your current drivers and do a clean install of the 25.10.2 combined drivers if you havent already (you can find it here):  https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-25-10-2.html,Neutral

Intel,I don't see how it would work on 23.9.1 lol,Negative
Intel,"Did you use DDU to uninstall the drivers and then reinstall using a driver installer from the AMD website? I found this guide yesterday and it was extremely helpful, specifically step 8:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1lnxb8o/ultimate_amd_performance_fix_guide_stop_lag_fps/",Neutral
Intel,I did it this morning before the new driver and confirm chipset drivers were untouched,Neutral
Intel,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.  More people use HDMI than what people think and those TVs don’t always have a DP connector at all.,Negative
Intel,"ah, that explains it. Thanks. :)",Positive
Intel,"What if one does not check release notes? V25.10.2 point to different packages, for installing both CPU and GPU you had to download the AutoDetect package (named “minimal install”). Obviously I’m referring to AMD driver download page.",Neutral
Intel,"Okay, as long as they have a workaround for that... I was planning to get a 9060XT, but also keep my 6700XT for lossless scaling frame gen, was worried the branching would affect that..",Neutral
Intel,"What a mess. I have rdna2 and 3 on the same PC, so combined driver is the solution for this? Or auto detect is the only way?",Negative
Intel,"Damn, that's a huge relief to hear. Most of the frustration came from not knowing whether the issue was even acknowledged.   Thanks a lot for the update.",Positive
Intel,What about Noise Suppression not working since 25.9.2?,Neutral
Intel,Finally. The last driver without pink artifacting was 25.4.1  It has been 7 months. AMD Matt acknowledged the bug on [the amd forums](https://pcforum.amd.com/s/question/0D5KZ000011WpJJ0A0/pink-square-artifacting-chrome-discord-and-steam) 5 months ago.  Please let it be fixed with the next driver update. So many 7000series users are on the verge of swapping to Nvidia.  https://i.redd.it/ywrg9at3lp1g1.gif,Neutral
Intel,"what about whatever changed post 25.3.1 for multi monitors? Any driver 25.3.1 and older i can run my main at 200hz, my side at 165, and my third at 60 without issue. Any driver newer than 25.3.1 and running my main at 200hz then playing a game will cause the second monitor (165hz) to flicker, glitch, and freak out the entire time, until the game on the main monitor is closed. Dropping to 165 on the main monitor down from 200hz \*fixes\* the issue but, i paid for 200hz and would like to be able to actually use it again.  (7700xt system)",Neutral
Intel,Hell yeah 🙂 amd I appreciate you see the issues Iv been a fan boy for a long time and I know it will be fixed,Negative
Intel,"Hi. Sorry, I thought this was pretty common as I've had this issue with two different systems and 3 AMD GPUs across 2 generations. [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1jayump/chrome_full_screen_freezes_after_switching_to_amd/) [Or here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/3890720/parts-of-screen-freezes-when-using-chrome) Chrome (or other Chromium browsers, I've had this happen with Edge too) in fullscreen, with graphics acceleration enabled.   Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind this only actually matters if one protocol or the other is **actually** limiting bandwidth for the [resolution * FPS] you want to display on your monitor  For instance, DP 1.4 can do ~25Gbits/s, which translates to roughly 1440p @ 240fps, or 4k @ 120fps  If you have proper cable into HDMI 2.1, it should be able to do ~42Gbits/s, which would instead be 4k @ 190fps  Read up the wikipedia tables for bandwidth specs and resolution / fps / bit depth rates for more",Neutral
Intel,Yeah most people are still have dp 1.4 monitors though. No way I'm swapping my monitor just for dp 2.1 as it's just too awesome. Although these tandem OLED screens look interesting... Hmm lol,Positive

Intel,"Could be it, nothing hardware wise at all and just software too.     Yeah, you're not the 1st I've read that says they have issues on the game.     If you're crashing and the system reboots it does make me think of some stability issues and not really just GPU, but I'm guessing you've already tried stability tests and using the system without OC+A-XMP/EXPO disabled.     Once upon a time I remember reading some people, on other instances and other games, having crashes like that (complete reboot) due to PSU instability as well.     Good luck!",Neutral
Intel,That's strange. My game defaulted to everything maxed out including running ray tracing and I haven't noticed any issues. The game runs incredibly well.  I've got a 5800X3D & 9070XT as well.,Positive
Intel,"Fair enough, and yeah sooner the better for all of us",Positive
Intel,It absolutely could be.  Europe has some pretty good consumer law and promising features that could impact your purchase decision are part of this law.  It can fall under misleading advertisement,Neutral
Intel,"It's not freezing, it's just that the GPU usage is practically at 100% all the time, even with V-Sync enabled. With the 25.9 drivers, this doesn't happen, and the clock speed varies normally, increasing and decreasing as needed when V-Sync is enabled. These 25.10 drivers are causing the GPU to consume more energy unnecessarily.",Negative

Intel,since last BF6 Update i had zero crashes also on 25.11.1,Negative
Intel,"That's not how it works. Small print won't save you from stuff like this, you think that they can stop releasing this software for 2-3 years because some small print said 'Subject to change'?

Intel,"sli/crossfire were killed for good reason, its just a bad time all around if half of your gpu's core/cache is located a foot away from the other half, unless your baseline performance is so damn low that the microstutters just get lost in the noise.  ultimately chiplet cpu/gpu designs are basically just an evolved form of sli/crossfire, and we're happily starting to get quite good at those.

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative

Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks.

What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra.

AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative
Intel,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",Negative

Intel,"You probably setup VRR wrong, whether that wasnt enabling V-Sync (yes, youre supposed to for VRR), or you tried to use an older HDMI standard, or had a bad driver install and didnt clean install new drivers.

As for A750 performance being worse than a 6800 XT, duh. One card sells for $180, the $450, they are in completely different price and performance tiers.

Intel,bruh. This is Intel first generation of discrete GPU. it's damn impressive how fast they are improving. I like AMD too but Intel is doing a pretty good job there,Positive
Intel,I had an arc a750 as a placeholder until I got. A 6950xt and I love it so much. Except amd still hasn't fixed the ghost of tsushima issue other than that it's been phenomenal and I get over 60fps in almost every game at 4k,Positive
Intel,"Well one great thing you have to look forward to is amd is going all in on software. They already said FSR with AI is coming, and I have a feeling a lot more. We should be seeing some pretty cool software features coming out now that they have more employees for software",Positive
Intel,"Actually not. Intel i740, released long time ago was the first discrete GPU from them.",Neutral
Intel,"I'm keeping my eye on Intel gpus, but I certainly won't be a first adopter. Honestly I'll be even more skeptical now with Intel's recent issues with 13/14 gen cpus.

If Intel can be competitive in the budget market it will at least put a fire under amd to lower their prices/make a better valued product.",Negative
Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't. Problems that Nvidia and AMD both solved decades ago that are holding Intel back in 2024.   It's not a mystery how a GPU should be built but that didn't stop Intel from not figuring it out.,Neutral
Intel,"Installs beta software, proceeds to complain about it",Neutral
Intel,Doesn't make it less of a fact that users are experiencing issues and they still paid hard cash for those GPUs.,Negative
Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral
Intel,"This was a graphics card, not a ‘GPU’ in terms that we understand them now, just to bolster the point about how much of a disparity this comparison reveals.",Negative
Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so? They paid full price for a product and it should work as advertised.  With that said, the issues with Arc are widely known and complaining about it after the fact is a bit sillly at this point.",Negative
Intel,If you're playing ghost of tsushima with her enabled it will crash your drivers and you'd have to re-download them via integrated graphics on your cpu,Negative

I have to reduce some settings in the heaviest games, but then I can hit 60fps in most games without using upscaling.  It makes me wonder if they have used older drivers, since they don;t even get 60fps rasterized at 1080p in some games.  edit: And I paid much less than the minimum price they are listing, I'd need to check if prices went up - even though computer base suggest that isn't the case. The bigger problem still, but getting better, is that when it doesn't work it's really really terrible.",Positive
Intel,"Well I mean... I guess it depends on what you're wanting to do of course, but even my 12 GB card was struggling to do raytracing a couple years ago, so that claim isn't really far fetched.  My 20 GB card struggles to hit 60 fps with path tracing at 1440p",Negative

It costed our company the weight of those cards in solid gold.   After years of battling AMD and failing, I made an ultimatum to our ceo and told him directly that I didn't want to support this anymore and that I'd leave if we didn't switch everything to Nvidia and I actually quit the company over this because the response was that it was impossible. 2 months later they sold all the AMD hardware at a fraction of the original price and managed to take a credit to switch everything to NVIDIA.  Somebody else even made a huge post here and on r/linux, phoronix covered it slightly and AMD went into full panic mode, their developer advocate came here and on AMD forums and in emails and made many grand promises. Here we are almost 10 years later, same issues still exist.  Oh yeah, and BlackMagic (DaVinci Resolve maker) today officially doesn't support their software on any AMD hardware.

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Intel,"And I'm over here struggling to keep an Nvidia T4 passthrough to work reliably on Hyper-V to Ubuntu 22.04. :(  Is there a specific software combination that works more reliably than others?   Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.  They working with some kind of magic radiation over there?",Negative
Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.  You're free to guess what vendor om looking at to replace my CPU with. Damn shame really.",Negative
Intel,"Fact: AMD does not give a shit about any of this.   We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line. If all CDNA customers switch to NVIDIA and those PO's dropped in volume, it might make them care a little bit.",Negative

Intel,"I’ve been buying ATI / AMD since the ATI Rage 128, and I think my next GPU will be Nvidia. I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

Intel,"[Wish i could play Hell Divers 2 but when i bought it took 30 seconds to get a driver timeout,](https://i.imgur.com/FqM9MRx.mp4) anyway i decided to not switch NVIDIA cos i also well usually play a lot of World of Warcraft but that game has problems for both AMD in form of freezes and driver timeouts gradually getting worse until you update drivers again, cos shader cache gets reset it stops crashing again for couple of days, then starts crashing more frequently and the frequency varies per user and what they doing as well as if their some sort of memory leak.  Also some other games having driver timeouts to, but i have games that also never timeout.  Speaking of which users started reporting flickering issues in browsers such as chrome, or any chrome based browsers, and their 2 reports of it being fixed after MPO is disabled so i guess MPO issues are back on the menu.

I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.  Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical. I guess that's why nobody is already doing it.",Neutral

I think they're the defense of a brand like it they are defending their sports club.  We're stuck between the overpriced that just work, and the nightmare the AMD software overall is. I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?

Not because I have something against this brand or the other, but because we need competitors, or else you'll end up paying 600$ for a nice system, and 6000$ for the GPU.

My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place. And if this is a feature that they do not want to support, having the documentation needed to self-support the feature.",Negative

Intel,"So maybe AMD should sponsor some development on widely used software such as Blender to bring it within a few percent, or embrace ZLUDA and get it to an actually functional state. As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies.

Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture.

Intel,"It's more that I don't want to reward a business for failing me.  If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU  partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.""

Ive had a few hiccups that looked like driver issues that turned out to actually be Windows issues, and i always wonder if people are quick to blame AMD for issues because of what they have heard vs actually investigating and finding the real cause of the problem.

Until I made my prior posts here on r/AMD, AMD were not interested or even awake when it came to these issues. I have had direct correspondence with John Bridgman where he confirmed that GPU reset was not even considered in prior generations.  Of what use are these support contracts and the high cost of buying these cards if AMD wont provide the resources to make them function in a reliable manner.

My gaming stability issues were always caused by unstable RAM timings and CPU OC settings - since I upgraded to an AM5 platform with everything stock, I'm solid as a rock.

Your issue is different (and valid), you don't need to conflate the known issues in professional use cases with gaming - it'll just get you pushback because people who use AMD cards for gaming (like me) know the drivers are fine for gaming, which makes you come across as being hyperbolic - and if you're being hyperbolic about the gaming stuff, what else are you being hyperbolic about?

There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).

I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.

Intel,So basically PC games are never going to tell us what the specs are to run the game native ever again.,Negative
Intel,"Well, folks, the game is basically software ray tracing an open world regardless of settings at all the times using compute shaders from what I gather. I mean, what'd you expect from something pushing consoles to the brink? That it would not be equally demanding on PC?",Neutral
Intel,The true crime here is needing FSR to reach these requirements.,Neutral
Intel,"Oh wow, this is probably the first time I'm seeing dual channel listed in the RAM section of specs requirements.",Positive
Intel,im more baffled as to why they are comparing a RX 5700 to a GTX 1070. Id have thought they would have said a RX 590 (instead of 5700) or RTX 2060 (instead of 1070),Negative
Intel,> Enthusiast   > 1440p [...] with FSR Quality [...] 60 FPS  1440p + xxxx Quality upscaling is just another way to say 1080p you cowards. It's 2023 and enthusiast level is 1080p @ 60 FPS.   Looks pretty though with the amount of vegetation.  I'm surprised that they put the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT side by side in a game that has forced ray tracing. I guess that's the advantage of being cross platform and AMD sponsored.,Neutral
Intel,"well, at least the chart is easy to read, not a complete mess",Negative
Intel,This gives me hope that Star Wars outlaws will also have FSR 3. 🤌,Positive
Intel,60fps with balanced upscaling on a 4080/7900xtx … That’s not a good sign,Negative
Intel,It's joever. We are officially at the point where devs are using upscaling as the standard to reach playable frame rates instead of optimizing their games.,Negative
Intel,"If you look in the top right, these seem to be based on ray tracing being enabled? If that is the case, these specs actually seem reasonable.",Neutral
Intel,"FSR and DLSS were supposed to be optional, now they seem to be mandatory in any graphics setup.",Neutral
Intel,Yay finally a game that'll have both fsr 3 and dlss 3 so it'll work perfectly on either gpu brand at launch.,Positive
Intel,"Really disliking this trend of all new games having ""with FSR/DLSS"" in their PC requirements tables. The requirements should all be done without any upscaling or frame generation tech to be upfront and honest about how the game will run. Upscaling will then just be an available option for users to further increase performance.",Negative
Intel,"Actually not to bad for current standards, 1440p 60 with fsr quality on a 6800xt/3080 is great if high includes RT, if it doesn't then it sucks",Negative
Intel,"So with my 6800xt, which should be able to do 1440p high settings at over 60fps easily, I'll have to use FSR just to get 60fps? Great, another unoptimized game headed our way.  So sick of the awful PC ports and such. 6800xt is still a very powerful card yet I'm seeing more and more games require it for 1440p 60fps high or even 1080p 60 fps high. Ridiculous.  The reliance on upscaling tech instead of properly optimizing the game is becoming a problem. And it seems this game has forced RT which is idiotic. RT destroys performance and should always be an option.",Negative
Intel,"If you notice, all the mentioned AMD GPUs are significantly better than Nvidia GPUs, so does that mean bad performance for AMD GPUs?",Negative
Intel,So i bought an 1200€ card (rx 7900xtx in my region and at the time of launch) and can now enjoy new games at 60 fps with BALANCED fsr upscaling. We love to see it. /s,Positive
Intel,so I'm doomed to use FSR even at 1080p ? what a shame pc gaming has become.,Negative
Intel,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?  (I'm not talking about this game in particular, just in general, it was same outrage w/ AW2 and that turned out better than expected)",Neutral
Intel,I hope they will bundle this game with CPUs/GPUs,Positive
Intel,holy hell so for 1080p you need a 1440p card because not even a RX 7600 is on par with a 3060ti or a 6700XT,Negative
Intel,Recently upgraded GPU and CPU and crazy that newer games are already requiring the newest GPUs to play them. Personally I don't think it's a horrible thing but at the same time it just screams horrible optimization.,Negative
Intel,This game better look like real life with those specs. I does looks beautiful!,Positive
Intel,"Another garbage with forced upscaling at baseline. When upscaling winded up - everyone was ""Hell yeah, high refresh rate AAA gaming""  Fast forward to today: ""FSR performance just to hit 1080p 60fps - yay..""   I fucking knew it.. it was so obvious upscaling will turn into this and replace game optimizations. Why optimizing shit, when you can tell people to turn on fucking FSR / DLSS / XeSS performance??   What a fucking shitshow... And few weeks back when I said I'm not gonna buy AMD GPU again because upscaling is getting mandatory and DLSS is just objectively superior - I was laughed in the face. Every major AAA game onwards will be shoving up upscaling as base line performance - so your typical 60fps marks (and 30fps - yes apparently that is still a thing on PC in 2023). There's no escape from this.",Negative
Intel,Damn. My 5700XT did Mirage fine on Medium/Low shadows. Now its basement quality.,Negative
Intel,This is starting to get scary and not cool. Every stat is not native performance and a 6800xt with fsr at 1440p is only pulling 60fps?!?!? What the actual fuck is going on?!?!? Midrange is definitely on its death bed if this is the new norm...,Negative

With this being a based on a movie game, I don’t have super high hopes that that’ll be the case though. Going from movie to game and vice versa almost always has bad results.   Also, displaying system requirements with upscaling is a bad joke. This is basically saying you’re not getting native 1080p 60fps without a 6800xt or 3080. Upscaling is definitely becoming the crutch a lot of folks feared it would be.",Negative
Intel,I thought upscaling technology is for low end gamers to get more FPS or people who work on 4k monitors and use upscaling to get better frames on them. but it seems to be used as an excuse for bad game optimization. What a complete joke!!,Negative

Intel,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",Neutral

Intel,"I've hated upscaling since the beginning.   Now, it's being proven right in our faces that companies are no longer making 100% they're making 45% done games, and then they rely on upscaling and fake frames to do the rest.   Why have a fully optimized game that runs well natively when you can just lower the resolution by 3x then have frame generation help?   Full force ahead to frame generation= Every game will be optimized so badly that you're forced to upscale",Negative
Intel,"It’s literally right there in the hardware specs. 1080p fsr2 quality is 720p input resolution, so at native the game runs at 720p low on a 1070 or 5700.  It is the inverse of what reviewers have been doing with their benchmarks - if you are a fan who really has a stick up their ass about native res, just do the math yourself. They’ve given you all the pieces you need to calculate it out yourself, but that’s not how the game is supposed to be run so they aren’t going to put native res in the official marketing material.  Games are optimized around upscaling now and it is unhelpful and misleading to pretend otherwise. Rendering 4x as many pixels is *obviously* going to throw things off with more intensive effects, and lead to a generally unplayable experience.",Neutral

Intel,"people also forget both AMD and nvidia didn't really offer a generation leap in GPU performance this gen, sure it's popular to call games ""unoptimized"" (I know many AAA releases are, not denying that) but the issue compounds with the fact that game devs couldn't predict a GPU generation to be this bad caused by inflated crypro-boom margins a generation prior",Negative
Intel,"As with almost every game release recently, expect the game to perform a bit better than the requirements.    Sometimes the hardware can achieve 60 FPS most of the time but drops below that in other times, so the devs just say it's guaranteed 30 FPS and call it a day. If you look at the 5700 vs 6700XT, the gap is almost 50% in most titles, this means that if the numbers for the 5700 were accurate then the 6700XT will be getting around 45 FPS at 1080p low (unless the game utilizes special hardware only available on the 6700XT) but the game targets 60 FPS at 1080p high on the 6700XT which leads me to believe the 5700 is gonna perform much better which should leave room for turning off upscaling.",Positive

Intel,"I agree with this, that’s not that outrageous if this does include RT. Non RT would be pretty bad to need fsr but that is the quality mode.",Neutral
Intel,This is going to be the exact same situation as with Alan Wake. The game is going to come out and the requirements are going to make sense. People just aren't used to seeing games with mandatory rt.,Neutral
Intel,I would say pressured bc they announced it over a year ago and promised we will get it in september. Thats the problem with games an tech they all make promises and then cant keep the deadline. Just make smth new and when it works then announce it and make the last fine adjustments. If you make promises to early you set yourself up for failure.,Negative

So there's that 😉",Neutral
Intel,Timed epic exclusivity? Aww man.,Negative
Intel,Was guaranteed to happen when up scaling was announced... It's an excuse for less optimisation or to push fidelity more.  I saw a video of this avatar game it got an insane amount of plants visible at all times.,Negative
Intel,You... are.. joking... right..?,Neutral
Intel,Because it’s not coming to steam. It’ll be an epic games exclusive so everyone will pass on it until it hits steam in 18 months. At which point no one will buy an 18 month old game for full price and will wait for a 50% off sale at the minimum.,Neutral

Intel,"Really comes up to how far the rt and lumen stuff can be pushed, if it goes to cyberpunk psycho rt levels? At release it needed a 3080 and 3090 with dlss.   So it could need top end gpu of this gen if its a similar case",Neutral
Intel,yup that is why I will play 1440 UW native with a 7900XTX.,Neutral
Intel,I guess they are confused with dlss.  Dlss 2= up scaling Dlss3 = frame gen  So they thought its for fsr3 too. ( as in fsr2 up scaling and 3 frame gen)   But fsr3 can do frame gen or not.  Fsr3 is up scaling and frame gen.,Neutral
Intel,"Likely mid range gpu and a suit yells in the background ""30 fps with up scaling is fine""",Positive
Intel,"Likely the same, they didn't want to make the graph even more annoying, hence why fsr3 and rt and xess are mentioned top right.

Intel,Most likely the upgrade part called FSR 2 and the frame creation part called FSR 3,Neutral
Intel,If they didnt get confused between FSR 3 and 2 then yes fsr 3 roughly doubles fps same for AFMF.,Neutral

Intel,For 30fps even lol,Neutral
Intel,"Especially recommending FSR.  DLSS at 1080p? Sure why not?   FSR at 1080p? Disgusting, absolutely horrific.  Anyone who downvotes this is a fanboy, end of story. Nvidia's DLSS simply is better at reconstructing an image. At lower resolutions that is SIGNIFICANTLY more important.",Negative
Intel,Or be happy your shitty video card is still supported.,Neutral
Intel,and we still get shat on for saying they are or admitting its a bad thing. corpo fanbois are so cringe,Negative
Intel,Even 4090 users use DLSS because it fixes TAA problems. And has a sharpening slider for easy sharpening adjustment.,Positive
Intel,When did I ever complain about how expensive gpus are. I've always been in the category that they are luxury item and vendor can charge whatever they want for em. So you aint never hear me complain about gpu prices.,Negative
Intel,I can't market a game for running with 120fps 4k with raytracing on on a RTX 4060.  But I can market 400 completely identical missions that take up 150 hours of your lifespan and empty out your soul.,Negative
Intel,Yea I know nothing about optimizations and if it could or couldn't fix this or that. I just want them to tell me exactly what I need to run the game at X resolution a Y preset with 60 fps. If that calls for a 14900k and a 4090 then just say so.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, I think we're really beginning to see a trend here with abusing upscaling for free mileage.  Not that upscaling isn't great but...  Apart from RT, on medium settings, I can't really see    massive improvements on visual quality that would warrant such a massive increase on requirements.  UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  We'll probably see this continuing to be a trend for a while, and then as tech novelty wears out, some devs will come out with more optimized and scalable titles.  With hardware prices being as they are, and with 60fps now being highly requested in consoles as well, it's pretty much a given.",Negative
Intel,"People accepted upscaling with open arms, so now devs know they can rely on people using it. Thus they don't have to care about optimizing for native res anymore. Oh you have a 4k card? Okay well we'll make sure it can run the game at 1080p so you can upscale it.",Neutral
Intel,"No average consumer wanted to come to this point. The market leader started pushing upscaling instead of just making stronger GPU’s and there’s nothing AMD can do to win them, only join them.",Negative
Intel,Turns out TAA is worse than AI TAA with AI upscaling.   Of course devs are gonna use it to cover their own asses. And they get perf boost!  Let's face it. The FUTURE is AI everything. Nobody is gonna talk shit about frame generation and upscaling when it looks perfect each frame.,Negative
Intel,But it does in many ways.,Neutral
Intel,"I don't know who those people are. I play all my games on native, whether I'm using an amd or nvidia card.",Neutral

Now with all the quality preset, we can't figure what quality to expect. 4k60fps at balenced preset? What's that crap even supposed to mean as thoses presets vary from title to title, from NVIDIA to amd. And btw, I'm still using fxaa over taa and fsr when i can, don't ask me why.",Negative
Intel,"You're even seeing this on console, where Spiderman 2 now has RT reflections in every mode. Even Unreal 5's Lumen renderer is a software raytracer that can be hardware accelerated.

Intel,False.  guy blocked me lmao,Negative
Intel,"I thought that was on Linux, though I might be wrong",Neutral
Intel,1070 doesn't have hardware RT though.,Neutral
Intel,According to the technical director there's no non-raytracing mode. I'm assuming that means software ray tracing for the minimum spec.  Source: Skill Up video - https://youtu.be/v91y87R5iDk?t=332 (5m32s),Neutral

Intel,Damn my brain must have been on auto pilot. I'm so used to 2160p + FSR quality neatly equalling 1440p.,Negative
Intel,I see the 5700 and the GTX 1070 on the minimum specs. Are those cards going to be RT capable for this game? (It's 30FPS LOW with FSR but still.),Neutral

Intel,Yep. This company learned something from all the failure game launches that happened this year. The game companies can't just implement one gpu company's tech and not the others bc then it'll only work on the one gpu that you implemented the tech for and it won't work on the other gpus from other companies. Meaning for example if a game company only implemented fsr it's only going to work on amd gpus and not on Nvidia and Intel gpus and vise versa is true too for both Nvidia and Intel gpus for dlss and xess.,Negative
Intel,Avatar is RT only. There is no non RT mode.,Neutral
Intel,This is mad with snowdrop engine. It's Ubisoft they don't use unreal...,Negative
Intel,"Yep, I missed that. Good call! Makes sense why the specs are a bit higher then but if it is forced on, that's going to be rough on any one with a more mid tier card.",Neutral
Intel,">  Consoles use mostly FSR balanced  heck sometimes they use performance or less, heck a lot of the time even. Especially with RT or performance modes",Neutral
Intel,They have really long way to go. Take for example Lords of the Fallen - UE5's TSR is better than FSR. Take Alan Wake 2 and you get ton of shimmering on the edges. It's also not like nvidia not improving - so while AMD makes a step forward so will do nvidia..   There's also question how much they improve without dedicated accelerators that both Intel and nvidia is using. Intel jumped late to the party and they're already ahead - which just shows how much AMD cares. It's rally embarrassing considering both XBOX and PlayStation are also relying on FSR - ant that's bigger market than what nvidia has.,Neutral
Intel,I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?  I mean the facts are the facts. I need to play on lower settings till we get a 5070 or 8800xt.,Neutral
Intel,"It uses their own in-house engine, Snowdrop. The last game this developer did was The Division II which was excellent.",Neutral
Intel,"Took a look at some gameplay on YouTube, and it does look nice enough, though water looked like ass, and as mentioned already, it's an in-house engine (which is nice to see TBH).",Positive
Intel,You will never see a high production game from Ubisoft ever on the Steam store ever again at initial launch.  They are the anti-christ of the gaming industry seriously.,Negative
Intel,Consoles are the baseline in most multiplat games and they've been using upscaling since forever. The real reason is just that we don't have GPUs anymore that are 10x faster than consoles like last gen. You can't bruteforce high resolutions in games that run at like 720p on consoles with GPUs that are only 2-3x faster.  If upscaling didn't exist on PC the minimum here would just be 720p at the minimum and 1080p-1440p at the max.,Negative
Intel,Next-gen doesn't mean that current gen can run it well. It means it's so far ahead that most curren-gen hardware can't run it properly + top-end hardware can only barely run it well.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly. These paid exclusive games launches only make me care less whenever they actually release.  It's not just Epic, Meta has done it with several games (Moss Book 2) and when a proper looking pcvr port comes a year later it sells bad because people forgot about it.",Negative
Intel,"Is that with significant RT? I assumed it was ""normal"" ultra settings.  Still I can play Far Cry 6 and RE4 with AMD sponsored RT at 4k native with 100fps. This game will have to look amazing to justify what... a quarter of that performance?",Positive
Intel,"You are correct. I overlooked the part where, under Ultra settings, it said that was with FSR2. Now it doesn't seem as bad. I mean, it's still not good because it's rendering somewhere between 1080p and 1440p, but at least it's not 30 fps without Frame Gen/60 fps with it like I thought.",Neutral
Intel,"It might be, AFAIK neither Nvidia nor AMD still support their implementation of it in their drivers.  But I've tried it on a few games and it is pretty cool to me, much stronger than almost any modern 3D movie (IMO why 3D has gone into hibernation), and I gather that Cameron designed the franchise around 3D.  Plus the Avatar 1 game was in 3D.  FWIW.",Positive
Intel,This is what I am thinking too.,Neutral
Intel,"You say that, but they specifically mentioned FSR3, and just DLSS, so i have a feeling DLSS3 will have to go via a mod again.",Neutral
Intel,"i have a believe that even 4C8T will survive for the decade, like the case of that 4790K. But turns out these newer UE5 games are wrecking even newish CPU like the 3600. i mean cmon it's still a 4 years CPU old which i think it's not old yet",Neutral
Intel,Let's hope so. 30fps is far from recommended for FSR 3,Neutral
Intel,Yeah I heard it works with that hoping it works with fsr3 now,Positive
Intel,"I've noticed that for some reason newer games look blurry at 1080 even without any kind of upscaling and I'm not sure why, older game look much sharper at 1080p",Negative
Intel,"Just lazy optimisation, that’s pretty much a PS5 equivalent GPU and you can be damn sure that the console version won’t be 1080P 30fps with FSR",Negative
Intel,"No it says 5700. NOT 5700XT, and yes there is a difference. Quite literally the difference between a 1070 and 1080ti. Or a 2070 and 2080.",Neutral
Intel,no no my 7 year old card needs to be able to play at high settings. so does my low end card from today. gotta be high or its just bad,Negative
Intel,Crazy expectation? A game released in 2023 should be able to run at 1080p low 30fps on a low end card like rx6500xt (lowest end modern card you can buy now).  Optimization matters.,Neutral
Intel,"Yup, these cards came out around the time of ps4 I think..that's a long time ago in the graphical quality of games we are seeing.  People should be happy to a point that those cards can even run some of these games if upscaling helps them run that's a bonus as it means they don't need to upgrade if those graphics settings are acceptable to them.",Positive
Intel,"I have a 5700 and it does better at 1080p on these games than what is normally posted. Now it does need quality fsr but its not the worst thing, anything lower than quality is. Bottom line is these are not 100% correct and never have been.  I have zero interest in this game but the specs seem fine even though I wish upscaling wasn't what was relied on for optimization.",Neutral
Intel,"well you dont know what they mean by 30 fps. It could be de 1% lows or the average, we dont know. The easy assumption is that it will be 30 fps average. but that's crazy that a game at 1080p low cant be run by a 5700. It better be a new Crysis.  edit: apparently it uses raytracing only for lighting which would explain the hows and why it crushes the framerate so bad especially on a gpu that doesnt have hardware raytracing like the 5700.",Negative
Intel,"Or in the case of games like Alan Wake 2, you will get unplayable fps if you try to running it at 4k native max settings. Even with a 4090, you will get a glorious 20fps.",Neutral
Intel,Assassins creed origins and odyssey side quests/collectibles oh my god,Positive
Intel,Yeah it doesn't give us a actual gauge to understand what we need for set native parameters. I mentioned optimization out of concern that they rely too much on upscaling and it seems like it's the lazy way out of something. It's unrealistic that a usable gaming experience be in a top tier hardware setup that costs $2k+ and top tier hardware of just the last generation are just barely cutting it anymore.,Negative
Intel,I appreciate your insights and opinions. Thank you.,Positive
Intel,">UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.

Intel,that's stoopid but it's somewhat more understandable. Why a 5700 would struggle so much since it doesnt have hardware raytracing,Negative

Intel,Some people seem to have very low sensitivity to added blur. See also *depth of field blur* and *motion blur* being on by default in every game.

Intel,Far cry 6 and re4 are older and or lower demanding games.  And yes any Mode here does either Hardware or Software rt from. Min to max.,Neutral
Intel,It's a 4 year old cpu yes... But how it was built (4c) was like 10 12 years now old.  6 cores are since a few years already base and more and more 8 cores are standard.,Neutral
Intel,TAA,Neutral
Intel,Temporal anti aliasing.,Neutral
Intel,"TAA is the devil. it forces a blur on every frame, and only gets worse as the resolution goes lower. its why fsr, xess, and dlss can look better than """"native"""" because it doesnt use the horrid plain taa solution so many games do. and why dlaa, and fsraa are so important and need to replace taa completely",Negative
Intel,"Ahh, welcome to r/FuckTAA",Neutral
Intel,Even 4K looks blurry with some implementations of TAA,Negative
Intel,they're giving you the bare minimum until your upgrade!,Neutral
Intel,Because they are built with upscaling in mind so they have a blurry looks intentionally as it works best with aggressive upscaling.,Neutral
Intel,"Not even close, you're completely out of your mind. The 5700xt is 9% faster than the 5700. The 1080ti is **32%** faster than a 1070 and the 2080 is **19%** faster than the 2070.

Intel,"Well the difference is only 256 shaders more on the 5700xt. The 5700xt has 2560 shaders and the 5700 2304. That's 11% more. That's not that much.  The 1080ti has 86% more cuda cores than the 1070, as well as more and faster memory. I would not compare now so haha",Neutral
Intel,"The 5700 and 5700xt is more like a 1070 and 1070ti situation. It's not that big a gap, and you can close it even tighter because the majority of RX 5700 cards can be flashed to a 5700xt bios tightening the gap farther.",Neutral
Intel,"The 1070 was released in 2016. Its already the end of 2023. That card belong to ps4 era. Wake up.   People in this sub are delusional, really.",Negative
Intel,Those are some dumbass expectations. Maybe you should correct them instead of blaming the developers for it.,Neutral
Intel,"The 6500XT offers $200 2016 performance. In fact its often worse because of how gimped it is interface wise. Its one of the worst products released in recent years.  Its not the game developers fault AMD pretty much rebadged the RX 480 4 times and they can't be expected to sink their optimization to that level.  RX 480, RX580, RX 5500XT and RX6500XT are virtualy the same product performance wise. RX 5500XT is the most consistent one of the lot offering a somewhat more modern arhitecture in its 8GB variant. The 6500XT on the other hand while on a newer arhitecture is an unmitigated disaster that is on par at best and sinks even below the RX580 when memory, bus and PCIE interface constrained.  The console baseline is around 6700XT/2070 Super/3060ti level. People better get used to that as its gonna become or already has become the norm for 1080p high settings gaming. The 5700 is upwards of 30% slower by default while also having less hardware features. Its gonna become the minimum norm going forward alongside the 2060's of your time.",Negative
Intel,"the 1070 was 2016, the 5700 was 2019. While both not new its not 10 years old like the PS4 (2013)",Neutral
Intel,This is literally only true if you use path tracing. I think you're trying to insinuate the game is unoptimized when it just scales really high with visual features if your hardware supports it. It straight up runs great for the visual features it uses.,Neutral
Intel,"That was exclusive to console releases, no? And never to the point of replacing AA sharpening and rendering the game from 720p…",Neutral
Intel,No I havent. AMD is bigger than Epic.,Neutral
Intel,"Right, you'll have different complaints but complaints none the less even though the new Ultra might still look slightly better prior gen games and offer high FPS but people would complain that the graphics are not advancing fast enough, they look the same etc etc.  Yah those days are likely gone but it's hard to say if it's because the game is unoptimized or if the dev is really pushing the limits of what they can do graphically and use upscaling as a buffer because what they have in mind, or what they intend to show is too taxing for current hardware. We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it. This is why I've never in my life ever pre-ordered a game. I still don't understand why people do it (esp now that games are digital) but lot of people do. Then again I've never really paid for a ""skin"" or some other visual add-on so maybe that's what attracts people.  I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets. The presets are all relative anyways. There's no universal settings that define what each preset represents.  I just don't get the outrage on these minimum spec sheets compared to what the game is showing graphically. At least wait until it releases and we have some hard data.",Negative
Intel,"I'm also a dev dood sometimes it's literally a ""foutage de geugle"" I had a friend who talk about how shit devs in EA (the people who's making the engine) code and doesn't optimise",Negative
Intel,"The commenter I replied to said there wasn't a big generational improvement for GPUs, while I said there was. But I agree that 4080 is expensive for what it offers.",Neutral
Intel,It was the same price as a 3090 at launch and offers 90% more performance.  It was definitely a generational leap.,Positive
Intel,It's software ray tracing which isn't accelerated by hardware.,Neutral
Intel,and i guess it can be hard to tell if ram is dual or single rank with just two sticks of it too.,Neutral
Intel,>might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.  I was pointing out that 1070 doesn't have hardware RT either.,Negative
Intel,So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?,Negative
Intel,"Why not make it toggleable though, you can choose other graphics settings so it makes no sense. Most people don't play games with RT enabled",Negative
Intel,Still kinda weird that they put the RX 5700/A750 on the same ballpark as the 1070... Being that the newer GPUs actually perform closer to a 1080(Ti).,Neutral
Intel,Sounds like improperly configured negative LOD bias. If you have Nvidia you can fix it with nvinspector. On AMD there's nothing you can do IIRC if Devs mess it up.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly what I'm telling them all the time, that I can see difference in textures, in hair, fences, powerlines etc. And every time I get downvoted by the army of ""but it looks better then native"". I feel like majority of that sub needs to go get a prescription for new glasses",Negative
Intel,"So if you stopped measuring who's bigger, why do you think I have no access to DLSS? Tested on rig with 4080 on a C2 42"" screen. Once you stop thinking with the tip of your head where probably Nvidia's logo is tattooed or maybe Jensen's face, who knows, you could come to realization that one person have access to more hardware then only his personal rig.  Do I say that FSR is better then DLSS? No! Both of them have their issues, but none of them is better then native. Keep on fanboying mate, instead of providing normal convoy as grownups",Neutral
Intel,I don't think YOU understand what you're talking about.  Did you seriously expect Snowdrop to be something used in like one game and then discarded completely?,Negative
Intel,"The thing is: creating good looking lightning with RT is much easier than with prebaked illumination. I can fully understand, why developers of new games are using RT as the basis of their game.",Positive
Intel,Minimum requirements go up as games get/look better. They probably made this game with the series s as the minimum. Low settings probably looks better than high in most games.   Rt for the last few years has been added on top of already complete games. Now games are being made with rt as the standard and they would have to manually do a ton of extra work to support 7+ year old hardware. It's the same as having to drop support for last gen consoles to be able to deliver a better game.,Neutral
Intel,"And still - superior upscaling makes it worth paying extra, RT on higher end is worth paying extra. AMD even this gen doesn't undercut price by enough, especially in EU where power efficiency also play a role. For example, assuming I'm gonna use GPU for 2 gens, then I save ~90-100€ with my usage just on electricity alone. I know it's over period of 4 years, but still it's price difference that will recoup over time, even if I have to pay extra upfront. AMD is simply no longer a value proposition.",Neutral
Intel,"They did not, lol - that fixes completely different thing, not the FSR caused shimmering edges.",Negative
Intel,Both excellent 👌 Down the Rabbit Hole was another solid one.,Positive
Intel,"RE4 came out this year.  Anyway the difference between us is I don't think any lighting effect is worth a $1,000 GPU using 1080p resolution and 60fps, but I know many disagree. That's life.",Neutral
Intel,"3600 and the 3300x was built with the TSMC 7nm if i recall, that was 2018 cutting edge tech. and somehow in gaming it's already obsolete. i was planning to replace mine with 5700x  but i cancel it because it's still very much capable for what i do now. but now after UE5 i think i'll reconsider it again, maybe even as far as 5800X3D",Neutral
Intel,It is crazy that I see everyone saying that modern games look blurry. I've known for years taa does this but it seems like I see more people than ever dissatisfied by it.,Negative
Intel,I have to turn it off in borderlands 3. Ugh.,Neutral
Intel,r/FuckTAA,Neutral
Intel,"My friend nicknamed it after his eyesight. When he wears glasses he has 20/20, but when he doesn’t he says that he sees the image about the same as without glasses",Neutral
Intel,"Out of curiosity what resolution do you usually game at and at what distance? I find taa usually looks pretty good in modern games, but I'm also playing on a TV (48 inches but I'm not at monitor distance anymore). When I played on my 1920x1200 monitor I HATED TAA, well, not as much as fxaa, but moreso than smaa, and I missed msaa or SGSSAA with a passion. Now on the TV at 4k (lol, usually not on a 6700xt), 1440p, or even 1080p I find TAA can do a pretty decent job paired with varying levels of the Radeon sharpness adjustment in the adrenaline drivers. But again, probably due to viewing distance.  Looks leagues better than FXAA and I prefer it to SMAA now. But again, I'm sitting further away and tweaking sharpening to my liking. FSR2 seems to be a wash most of the time but the performance gain is worth it.",Positive
Intel,You dumbass do understand that even the console version of the recent games are total mess? Alan wake 2 have to run on reduced settings to even reach 30fps on xbox/PS. Callisto protocol used to have frametime issue on consoles. Console ports still targets 30fps on quality settings with upscaling while target should be 60fps with 120fps for performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, seems you are correct, it was the ps4 pro that came out in 2016, still, I wouldn't expect that to be capable of running some of the games we are seeing now without some serious compromises.",Neutral
Intel,I never said that Alan Wake 2 is unoptimised. I just said that even a 4090 can’t max out the game at native 4K resolution.,Negative
Intel,epic is tencent...,Neutral
Intel,"In terms of absolute numbers sure, 3090 always had a stupid price tho for being 10% faster than a 3080.   In terms of performance per dollar the 4090 even at 2x 3080 performance was worse value since you pay 1600 not 1400.",Negative
Intel,"Yes, you either have to get the spec sheet of the RAM modules (That even then it may not specify if it's a single/dual rank module) or test it in a system and use HWinfo/CPU-Z. Not as straightforward as dual channel that's mostly just using two identical modules.",Neutral
Intel,You don't need RT hardware to do software RT. That's what I'm saying.,Neutral
Intel,"For this particular game, there is a software fallback. Also, even if we did get a game that mandated hardware support for RT they'd still likely build it with console in mind so even RDNA2 GPUs shouldn't have issues",Neutral
Intel,"The first RT/DLSS capable cards are 5 years old now, way older than the current consoles. You are definitely not being left behind if you're only outdated by 1 gen lol",Neutral
Intel,I mean the last non ray tracing cards were released 4 years ago (1650/60 and 5000s from AMD),Neutral
Intel,Games running poorly on computers weaker than current gen consoles isn't exactly anything new.,Neutral
Intel,"No, you have multiple generations of games from prior to raytracing to enjoy.  Games shouldn't be held back forever just because someone wants to game on a GeForce2 MX400.",Negative
Intel,You are stuck playing older games. Unless someone can find a way to disable it with a mod.,Negative
Intel,> So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?  A gen old is second gen RT e.g. rtx 3000.  We're halfway through the third RT/matrix generation right now.,Negative
Intel,Yes hah,Neutral
Intel,"The 3090 or 6950xt will very likely run this game extremely well, they're a gen old.",Neutral
Intel,"For the AMD GPU, it's probably because minimum will be the max it will support. Medium probably requires Hardware RT.  For Intel, I don’t know. Perhaps it signal not so great optimization for Intel GPUs...",Neutral
Intel,DLSS is very strong in thin lines like fences & hair. Much better than most TAA solutions. Not sure about FSR in general.  An example: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6erA6BVkAAuf_M?format=jpg&name=large  Only DLSS resolves the lines properly.,Positive
Intel,"I mean, it's not that black and white. Quality upscaling to 1080 will obviously be more noticeable than 4k. Maybe you *can* tell the difference between 4k native and dlss quality, but people aren't gonna believe you unless you prove it with some kind of blind test, but I doubt you'd be willing to go out of your way to do that.  Even if you could, the benefits of better aa might outweight some negligible drop in textures or whatever it is upscaling reduces. Though that's irrelevant when DLAA or NAA are options too, I guess.",Neutral
Intel,"Test, which one looks better, explain.  https://imgsli.com/MjE3MzEy",Neutral
Intel,Oh man the hair... its so crazy how much upscaling kills the hair..,Negative
Intel,i mean they already arent the smartest bulbs considering they went team green.,Neutral
Intel,Reading comrehension dude.,Neutral
Intel,"I do, but thanks for your interest.",Positive
Intel,That will depend on the user. Power is cheap here in canada so none of thar factors into my buying decisions. And rt will depends on the games you play also not everyone plays tripple a games.,Neutral
Intel,"You need to get 23.20.17.05.  Fixed Issues Intermittent flicker may be observed on some textures while playing Alan Wake 2.  Fixed for most people, also has a nice performance boost of about 10fps from what I'm seeing.  That being said I always prefer native resolution unless absolutely necessary. So far only had to use it in Martha is Dead.",Positive
Intel,Nice. It’s on the list. Thanks man,Positive
Intel,Yes.... 7nm was but 4 cores the actual important thing was obsolete like 10 or 12 years ago.,Neutral
Intel,Probably because TAA is (unfortunately) more prevalent than it ever was.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, most people are FINE with it. Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  The thing is, you have sharpening filters today. You can adjust the sharpening for TAA. You can make it look oversharpened if you want. There's driver level sharpening for both AMD and NVIDIA. Both also have software sharpening filters.  And DLSS and FSR bot have sharpening sliders.  There's 3 ways to adjust how blurry and how sharp the game looks for everyone. It's a non issue and even Digital Foundry acknowledges the benefits of TAA for game devs vs things like the blur. At the end of the day, these games are looking great...in this era, with exceptions. Not all games are blur. The whole blur thing was like in the past 4 years since upscalers started and TAA became the norm. But with all the sharpening options, and with devs actually used to making TAA not so soft looking, things are definitely getting a lot better for TAA.",Neutral
Intel,Oh my bad if I read that wrong,Negative
Intel,And I'm saying 1070 doesn't have hardware RT so it's just as gimped as AMD cards when doing RT.,Negative
Intel,Still pretty annoying nonetheless. Until it's stable no way should it be forced upon a game when someone's willing to run it normally at native.,Negative
Intel,"and the 2080ti is still winning, best purchase in gpu i made in a long time.",Positive
Intel,imagine being mad that 4 year old cards arent high end,Negative
Intel,I'm on a 6700XT. 🙇. I just feel very shocked that I would probably need a gpu upgrade soon. With the demands of new games. Also 1440p ruined me.,Negative
Intel,"Technically makes sense, but they can just make RT something you can toggle between Software/Hardware and they also could just add the Vega 56 in the requirement sheet being that was AMD's competitor to the 1070 or they could've added the GTX 1080(Ti)/RTX 2060(Super) into the sheet.  On Intel's side they only have the A580 as the closest GPU to a 1070, even when it's too similar to the A750 performance wise :/",Neutral
Intel,"It is that black and white for me. I can immediately see the added image softness from upscaling, and it's especially prevalent with DLSS 2.5+ unless you enable a sharpening filter. DLAA also has weird issues like blurring textures (almost like it reverts to initial mipmap) while moving, usually at mid-distance from camera. It's too distracting and I have to go back to regular TAA. Immediately goes away.  1440p to 2160p is better than 720p to 1080p, but it's still noticeable. Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible? No. Actually changing monitor resolution outside of native and having all UI elements scaled looks terrible. That was what we used to do and upscaling is much better than that alternative. LCD panels need to stay at native signal resolution and GPU should scale render resolutions.",Negative
Intel,"And you look at static image all the time while gaming? It's different story when movement is involved, that's where you find all the artefacts you get. Static image doesn't tell a thing when it comes to gaming",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, and that's driving me crazy. I really couldn't stand it in Cyberpunk (in other titles it's either hit or miss), that I play it in native 4k instead.",Negative
Intel,"Wouldn't phrase it like that tough. I had that choice too in January, and actually by going 4070Ti instead of 7900XT I would be able to play Cyberpunk in higher fidelity and better frames then on mine, because AMD cooked FSR3.0 almost a year in the oven, and God knows how long it will take for CDPR to add it to the game, if ever considering that active development on game is ended and they are on bug fixing sprint right now. Also AMD needs to fix FSR in general, because how it works with smaller details like hair and fences is awful. But don't get me wrong, I love my card, just feel I git sold on features that would come handy right kow instead of when I don't need them anymore",Neutral
Intel,"Sorry mate, guess I need to read comments early morning instead of late night, just saw that last bit. My apologies. I'm just tired of upscalare wars whatever sub I go, and green team fanboys screaming that ""FSR is shit, DLSS is better then native"" and then throwing around static images for comparison",Negative
Intel,"It's for textures, not object edges from FSR use, lol. Two completely different things",Neutral
Intel,"people echoing the same shit like ""ooh 4C is obsolete, you need to upgrade that geriatric cpu"". 4C is still solid for gaming (ofc no UE5) and literally anything beside doing compute intensive professional workloads.",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening makes the image less blurry, but it doesn't recover the texture detail lost from TAA blur.",Negative
Intel,"""Even Nvidia foundry""   \---   they are like chief proponents of blur-tech and they don't care about how sharp and easy-to-see the image is. TAA flattens the image so you can't see which objects are far and which are near, you have to strain your eyes and mind to determine that which is unbearable to many. Just give us option to disable it even if it breaks some effects (which is just lazy thing to do on the side of devs)",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening fixes blur, not clearity. That is TAA destroys+add significant ghosting no matter the implementation.      Sharpening looks was worse than the normal cleairy of games, it's not the same thing at all.      >Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  We are mad because it being forced 1 and 2 it's being used to hide lazy effects that break without temporal frame smearing. People are now punished for turning off forced frame smearing.",Negative
Intel,And I'm saying that maybe the GTX 1070 is better at even software RT compared to AMD cards with no RT hardware. GTX 10 series card did get RTX support through CUDA even though they were horribly bad at it. Older AMD cards with no RT hardware didn't get any support like that from AMD.,Negative
Intel,"You're not forced to use upscaling though. Unless you replied to the wrong person this is about ray tracing, which can be run at native just fine. If your GPU can't handle RT at native res, then just use upscaling.",Neutral
Intel,The minimum requirements for this game includes de 1070: a 7-year-old gpu from 2016.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm not really shocked, and was out there telling people not to buy those cards on day 1 in large part because of their deficiencies in RT performance and complete lack of matrix accelerators (which Nvidia and Intel have both made a large part of their architecture and got shockingly good results with - DLSS and matrix-XeSS are twice as good as FSR)",Negative
Intel,5700 was probably the lowest AMD card they had to test with.,Neutral
Intel,"It also looks better in gameplay, less ghosting, less shimmering, less aliasing.   So which one looks better? You clearly see the difference in textures/fences/powerline, right?  I even made it easier for you, both images are 1080p output.",Positive
Intel,I personally didn't try DLSS even once but FSR 2.0 does have shimmering I notice to various degrees. It was very noticable on fur in Ratchet & Clank cutscenes for example. Overall I am just happy my 5700xt could still keep up with 1440p.,Neutral
Intel,Hmm yeah whatever you want to believe and let's you sleep.  Have a nice day.,Positive
Intel,AMD CAS is aimed to restore detail,Neutral
Intel,"They aren’t chief proponents of anything, TAAU has been popular for well over a decade at this point and it’s the default approach for consoles (checkerboarding has moire and aliasing issues) and digital foundry simply recognizes this is the reality of how the console world has settled on doing graphics.",Negative
Intel,The problem with Nvidia is they are massively overpriced. One 4080 would probably cost the same as my whole build or more.,Negative
Intel,"Yes I see which one looks better, and as I said before it's a static image. While I didn't use upscaling in this same exact example, I can go by my own experience and tell that it doesn't look better then native let's say in same Cyberpunk or any other game. And I will beleive my own eyes on my own screen then static images tossed around. TBH, in my opinion it all depends on screen and screen size too, as to me that difference between upscaled and native was less noticible on my old 27"" 1440p screen then it is now on 42"" 4k. DLAA tough, that's another story",Neutral
Intel,"I tried both, and neither of them are better then native as people tend to claim. In my testing FSR have big problem with smaller details like hair, fur, fences, powerlines and as you mentioned, you get severe shimmering effect. I really hope AMD will keep on working on it, an try to get away from that. But DLSS also adds shimmer, it's just less visible then in FSR (atleast in my testing on Cyberpunk pre 2.0), and whatever upscaling method I've used I also could see that image is upscaled (lower res textures here and there etc.). I like idea being upscaling tech, it helps prolong life of GPUs, and for more powerful GPUs to run higher settings with more fidelity, but there's still work to do on them as they aren't perfect yet.",Negative
Intel,Yeah but a 3060ti didn't,Neutral
Intel,"In Cyberpunk you are not comparing upscaling vs no upscaling at the same settings though. You are comparing low RT native vs path traced upscaling and at 4K, the decission there is absolutely clear. On my 4k OLED screen, upscaled PT is so clearly the way to go, there is no competition.",Neutral
Intel,"The gameplay looks exactly like the image + your typical TAA/DLSS smearing. And as I said, in my example DLSS also looks better in gameplay, because as you see... native has a ton of aliasing which is super noticeable while playing (shimmering). There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling. Talking about native is nonesense, just image quality counts and thats were DLSS or even FSR 2 (some games) gets better and better. There is a reason why consoles use it... it looks better than without it.",Positive

Intel,"I mean, Path tracing is to Ray tracing, what Ray tracing is too rasterization.",Neutral
Intel,When Cyberpunk first came out the 3090 only got 20 fps in RT Psycho mode.  https://tpucdn.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-founders-edition/images/cyberpunk-2077-rt-3840-2160.png  Still does  Fast forward just one gem and you don't see anyone saying its demanding with many able to get RT Psycho on thier cards as new cards got faster.  Give it 2 gens and you are going to get 4k60 here.  Gpu will improve and get faster.,Neutral
Intel,"Look at that, my 6700XT is just 19fps slower than the RTX 4090 in this title.",Negative
Intel,It's a good thing nobody has to actually play it native.,Neutral
Intel,Well good thing literally nobody is doing that…,Negative
Intel,The future is not in native resolution so this is really pointless information.  Cyberpunk looks absolutelt mindblowlingy insane with all the extra graphical bells and whistles it has gotten over the years and with Nvidia’s technology it runs so damn smooth as well.,Positive
Intel,4.3fps lol. No amount of upscaling is going to fix that and make it playable. People were saying the 7900xtx had 3090ti levels of RT when it launched. A 4060 ti is 50% faster then it.,Negative
Intel,That's actually pretty amazing for any GPU to get a metric in frames per second instead of minuites per frame.,Positive
Intel,"Meh I get like 90+ fps with everything cranked with RR, FG and DLSS(Balanced) toggled on with my 4090 @ 4k.  Path tracing does introduce ghosting which is annoying buts not really noticeable most times but at the same time with RR enabled it removes shimmering on 99% of objects that is normally introduced with DLSS so I am willing to compromise.   Honestly as someone who used to have a 7900XTX I am disappointed with AMD its clear that AI tech in gaming is the way forward and they just seem so far behind Nvidia now and even Intel(going by some preview stuff). FSR is just not even comparable anymore.",Negative
Intel,Who cares when it looks worse than with dlss and ray reconstruction on top of running a lot worse? Native res 4k is pointless.,Negative
Intel,"Well the upscaling in this game is really good, DLSS with ray reconstructions AI accelerated denoiser provides better RT effects than the game at native with its native Denoiser.  Also Path tracing scales perfectly with resolution so upscaling provides massive gains. using DLSS quality doubles performance to 40fps, and dlss balanced gives 60fps on average, performance about 70-80 or 4x native 4K, that includes the 10-15% performance gain RR gives as well over the native denoiser as well.  I've been playing with about 60fps on average 50-70. with DLSS Balanced and RR and its been amazing. I don't like frame gen tho since it causes VRR flickers on my screen",Positive
Intel,"Running Ray Tracing or Path Tracing without DLSS or Ray Reconstruction is like intentionally going into a battlefield without any gear whatsoever, it's absolutely pointless and suicidal, what we can clearly see here though is top of the line 7900 XTX losing against already mediocre mid-range 4060 Ti by over 50%, which is just beyond embarrassing for AMD Radeon.  All this says to me is AMD Radeon need to get their shit together and improve their RT / PT performance, otherwise they will continue to lose more Marketshare on GPU department no matter how hard their fanboys thinks that they are pointless features, just like DLSS was back on 2020 right?  Also, with my 4070 Ti OC i can run it at average of over 60 FPS at 1440p DF optimized settings with DLSS Balanced + Ray Reconstruction without even using DLSS Frame Gen, with it on i can get over 80+ FPS",Negative

I've tried many times with different ray-tracing options and they all look good and all. But in the end I closed them all, turned back to Ultra Quality without ray-tracing and started playing the game over 120FPS.  This is a good action fps game now. I need high fps with as low latency as possible. So who cares about ray-tracing and path-tracing.  Yeah ray-tracing and path-tracing are good. But we are at least 2-3 generations away for them to become mainstream. When they are easily enabled on mid-range gpus with high-refresh rate monitors, they will be good and usable then :)",Positive

Imo, the more AI-upscaling you have to turn on, the worse the Nvidia purchase is.   I have a 6900XT and I will readily admit that the RT experience (ultra RT, no path tracing) at native 1080p resolution is ok, like 30-45 FPS (around 50 on medium RT settings), but if I turn RT lighting off (so RT shadows, sunlight, and reflections are still present) suddenly I get pretty consistent 60 FPS (i left my frames tied to monitor refresh rate, so 60 FPS is my max) and i can't tell the damn difference at native 1080p compared to RT medium or Ultra.

Intel,"Once they introduced this dlss upscaling anti-lag all these gimmicks I don't think we've seen true 4K native and almost anything lately.  This is maybe one game that does look that good but many of the games don't look that great and have some really serious system requirements when there are games that look much better and are much better optimized.  Companies are taking shortcuts, instead of optimizing they give you suboptimal and use FSR dlss all these gimmicks.  Don't get me wrong I always thought it was great for people who wanted to reach a certain frames per second someone with a weaker system to allow them to play at least the minimal at a steady frame rate.  It just seems like this is the normal now non-optimized games.  The 4090 is a beast if you could only get about 20 frames native with Ray tracing it tells you everything you need to know about Ray tracing.  It needs to be reworked that needs to be a new system I believe one real engine has it built in in a certain way probably not as good as Ray tracing directly.  To me it seems like ray tracing is hampering many games that tried to add it, too much focus on that instead of actual making a good game.

But the FG in CP2077 is decent with 60 fps output, ~~and I get ~65-70 fps output with quality DLSS + FG at 4k on a 4090.~~ EDIT: I misremembered what I was getting. With path tracing, DLSS quality, frame generation, and ray reconstruction, I got 80.1 fps with the benchmark!  Of course there's the matter of latency, and the latency of CP2077 with FG output of ~65-70 fps isn't great. So I'll often use DLSS balanced + FG.

It's not about being a fanboy of amd, but ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick, not because it's unnoticeable or bad, just because it's not ""popular"" (I myself really like it). I would personally go amd over nvidia because those 50 or so euros more that nvidia has against the amd counter parts simply are too much for just better rt and  dlss. I could spend those for a better amd card with generally better performance.  Regarding dlss, personally I would just lower the graphics before resorting to kinda bad generated frames, fsr even worse. But that's my point of view.  I find that amd still has to fix some driver issues but other than that, they are a fine brand. (so is nvidia)",Neutral

Intel,Fanboyism of both kinds is bad,Negative
Intel,"It won't end, but hopefully we see games that have art designed with RT lighting and reflections in mind.  Cyberpunk isn't it. We'd need a full rebuild of the game, every location, every asset and surface remade, so it looks like originally intended by the artists.",Neutral
Intel,Since it needs more than 10gb vram,Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is more optimized than majority of games that came out in last two years. Just because you can't run it at 4k 120 fps with path tracing doesn't mean it's not optimized.,Positive
Intel,It’s not unoptimized at all. Game runs great for the quality of the graphics. You guys just don’t understand the insane amount of power path tracing takes. The fact you can do it at all rn is insane but once again people just throw “unoptimized” at it because they don’t understand the technical marvel happening in front of their eyes.,Negative
Intel,"No, this game is actually very well optimized. It's just extremely demanding at 4k native, which is why DLSS exists.  It would be unoptimized if it ran like this while looking like nothing special, but this is probably the game with the best graphics, period. At the very least, it's certainly the game with the best lighting.",Positive
Intel,"and people will be like ""well RT is the future""  raster was fine for over 15 years and raster games look great but we get it we must let incompetent game devs and their bosses make shit quality games because average gamer is ready to spend $100 to pre-order electronic version of horse shit and then justify it for years because they can't admit they wasted money",Negative
Intel,It's settled that you have no idea what you talking about,Negative
Intel,Its full path tracing u cannot really optimize this much.,Negative
Intel,"It always did. Most games don't scale well, Cyberpunk does.  Look at the last two years of pc ports and you will understand how cyberpunk looks and performs like it's black magic.",Neutral
Intel,"Baked illumination requires you to choose where to add light sources and how the lighting is applied to everything, it's a creative choice of the author, the AI needs instructions to know what to do, so it would need constant handholding, on the other hand RT uses simple physics to calculate how light bounced and NN to apply the light on surfaces.",Neutral
Intel,But the destructable environment and the water graphics and other things in Direct X 9 made high end pcs kneel as well.  I remember playing on my 9800gtx/+ with my Intel Q9300 quad core (lapped and oc'ed to 3.0ghz - EDIT: checked some old evga posts got it to 3.33ghz) with 2x4gigs DDR2 @1000mhz cas 5 trying to maintain a sustained 30fps at 900p resolution on my 1680x1050 monitor. And I oc'ed the crap out of that 9800gtx 835 mhz (cant recall if it was unlinked shadder or not now) core on blower air (won the silicon lottery with that evga card).  Tweaking settings was mostly user done and guided with old school limited forum help. Ahh the good old days of having lots of time during school breaks.,Neutral
Intel,"The equivalent of a 4090 at the time, 8800 ultra (768MB) got 7.5 fps at 1920x1200 very high quality. The other cards were not able to run it. Even the lowest tier last generation card runs this, even though it's at 5% speed.",Neutral
Intel,No and no again lol  The 8800gtx could do 1152x864 high and that was the top dog. DX9 cards could do that at medium but high shaders was like a 25fps average tops and that dropped into the teens on the snow level.   It took things like the gtx480 and HD 6970 to do 1920x1080 30fps max settings. That's before getting into Sandy Bridge being the first cpu that could sustain 40+ fps if the gpu power was there.   Crysis came during the core 2 duo/k8 athlon and first wave dx10 cards era and it took *2 more generations* of *both* gpus and cpus to do it some justice.,Neutral
Intel,"My 8800ultra was getting single digit fps at 1080p ultra, so CP isn't quite as demanding.",Neutral
Intel,Amd had a tessellation unit. It went unused but it was present,Neutral
Intel,"My fun story for PhysX was Mirrors Edge. I don't remember what GPU I had at the time but the game was pretty new when I played it. Ran fine for quite some time until one scene where you get ambushed in a building by the cops and they shoot at the glass. The shattering glass with PhysX turned on absolutely TANKED my framerates, like single digit. I didn't realize that the PhysX toggle was turned on in the settings. This was at a time when PhysX required a dedicated PCIe card in your system.   Once I turned it off it ran fine. Now I can run that game at ridiculous framerates without my system getting warm.",Positive
Intel,"I remember around about 2008 when companies like Asus and Dell were selling ""Physics Processing Units"" and some claimed that these would be commonplace in gaming machines just like Graphics cards had become 10 years previously.",Neutral

Intel,>PhysX  It never was a dedicated Nvidia card - it was a [dedicated psysx](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/bfg-ageia-physx-card/) on which the tech later was bought by Nvidia and implemented in it's own GPU's.  But the things never became really populair.,Neutral
Intel,"This makes me wonder if we'll ever see something similar with Raytracing, where we get a 2nd GPU purely for RT, and then the main GPU just does all the other stuff. Would that even be possible?",Neutral

Intel,The ray/path tracing in this case done by specialized hardware which has more room to grow faster.,Positive
Intel,"I would, transistor shrinking isn't the only method of increasing performance, and honestly, these companies have to keep putting out better cards to make money.  There have been many breakthroughs over the last few years. I give it another 5 as both amd and nvidia are pushing ai accelerated ray tracing on their cards, nvidia is in the lead for now but amd will eventually catch up.",Positive
Intel,There is still a big leap possible since all lithography processes at the moment are hybrid euv and duv.   But the moment everything is done euv things will drastically slow down.,Neutral
Intel,"No those are just pennies in the pocket of Nvidia, but as the consequence you as the customer need to take a mortgage on a brand new GPU.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah the next 10 years are gonna be spent getting budget cards up to 4090 level performance, rather than bringing the bleeding edge to 5-10x the 4090 performance. As long as 4K is king, there’s not much incentive to do the latter.",Negative
Intel,"In 10 years we will be begging one of several thousand test-tube created Musk Family members for $200 so we can buy a cheeseburger.  But the jokes on them, we’re just gonna spend it on space crack.",Negative

Intel,"They just need to render the minimum information needed , and let the ai do the rest",Neutral
Intel,"Don't get upscaling, to me it looks shite. Why spend hundreds or thousands on a GPU to not even run at native resolution.   It's something Nvidia are pushing because they've got a better version of it at the moment.  Maybe it'll improve, it's pretty much snake oil currently imo.",Negative
Intel,"Feels pretty good with 120 frames. Playing with a controller, i don‘t mind or even feel the input lag on a projector screen.",Positive
Intel,"It's mad that even with a 4090 running games at 4k, they still look less realistic than the low-res FMV sequences in The 7th Guest from 30 years ago.",Negative
Intel,"Do keep in mind that despite both being named the same, the devil's in the details. Movies use way more rays per scene and way more bounces too.   Path tracing in CP2077 shows temporal artifacts due to denoising, something that doesn't happen in movies. It is being improved with the likes of DLSS 3.5, but it is still quite off when compared to said movies.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind the systems that rendered toy story 1, costing upwards of like 300k IIRC, have less power than your cell phone today and were super delicate/finicky machines. There's a dude on youtube that got a hold of like the second best one that was made at the time and the machine honestly was really impressive for when it came out, but it pales in comparison to even a steam deck really.",Neutral
Intel,"> Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story  Toy Story didn't use path tracing though, A Bug's Life was Pixar's first movie to use ray tracing (not path tracing) and only for a few frames in the entire movie for specific reflections, they started using ray tracing more generally for Cars and I can't find exactly when they started using path tracing but it should be around the early 2010s which is also when the other Disney animation studios started using path tracing",Neutral
Intel,No it's not a miracle. Because it's downscaled a lot and also uses lower quality math and piggybacking on AI to make up for it. It's basically running through 3 layers of cheats to produce results that aren't that much better than just traditional raster.,Negative

Intel,4090 getting 60fps at 4k balanced dlss with no frame gen. 100 with frame gen. I can make it drop into the 20s if I stand right next to a fire with all the smoke and lightening effects or if I go to a heavily vegetated area it’ll drop to mid 40s. But it’s stay consistently at 55-65 and even goes Into the 90s if I head out of the city.   Haven’t tried it at quality or with dlss off though. May go do that now that it says only 19fps lol. Have to try it to see for myself,Neutral
Intel,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-dlss-35-tested-ai-powered-graphics-leaves-competitors-behind  Well it's so close (54fps) it's more like a 3080Ti or higher from 3000 series or a 4070TI + from 4000 series it seems? The old 3000 series is punching way above it weight vs the 7900xtx, which was meant to deliver similar RT performance to the 3090.. which it doesn't.",Neutral
Intel,At some point the RT pixels are so expensive that native resolution w/o DLSS and frame gen is just not gonna work for the time being.,Negative

Intel,Only people who don't give a shit about high quality graphics don't care about ray tracing.,Negative
Intel,I got a stupidly good deal on the 4090(buddy won an extra one from a company raffle) and it just so happened my XTX was one of the cards suffering from the mounting issue on release.  Honestly very happy that all of that happened. Sure I would have been happy with the 7900xtx if I got a replacement but the 4090 just kinda blew me away especially with all the DLSS tech behind it.,Positive
Intel,"Nvidia used cp77 as a testing grounds for their dlss3 and rt tech, it'd no surprise it looks and performs relatively good, they literally partnered with cdpr for that.  Do not expect these levels of RT on most games anytime soon, probably in a couple years (with rtx 5000 series) the tech will be more mature and not as taxing for most cards, because needing to upscale and use framegen to get 60fps on an RT PT setting is kinda absurd.",Positive

Intel,"There are a lot of new games that features Ray Tracing on them as of now, too bad most of them doesn't look as visually as good as they could be though as most of the time their RT effects are dumbed down or reduced to the point it's pointless.  But the thing is that wasn't the point even from the beginning, RT Overdrive on Cyberpunk is literally considered as a Technological showcase  What matters here IMO for all of us is PC platform in general is showcasing here what a real high-end computers can achieve beyond what current gen console can do, and they are showcasing it really well here on Cyberpunk with much better visuals and using plenty of tricks to make them more than playable, where they shouldn't be considering how much demanding they are over standard, that is impressive enough to me and shows a good sign of technological engineering innovation.   As what Bryan Catanzaro said on his interview on DF Direct, work smarter not harder, brute force is not everything, of course it still matters a lot but doing it alone is starting to become pointless just like how it is on real life.",Negative

Intel,Nice but ive been playing video games since the 70s and its Shit end off..,Negative
Intel,The future of frame generation is going to be huge. I can definitely see 360p frame rendering upscaled to 4k with 80% maybe even 90% of the frames being generated. All with equal to or even better visual quality.   A 20 FPS game like this will become a 100-200fps game.  We may be looking at the end of beefy graphics cards being required to play games. Just a good enough mid or low tier chip (granted 5-10 years from now) with frame generation might be enough.,Positive
Intel,"After 2.0, it's around 100""fps"". Just 60""fps"" (meaning with FG enabled) is far from being playable due to latency. You need at least 90""fps"" for playable experience.   Cyberpunk PT vs RT is a huge difference in terms of graphics, while DLSS Quality vs Balanced is really slim in comparison. What you say would be a really bad trade-off.   At 1440p DLSS Quality it's easily 120+""fps"" which is perfectly comfortable.",Neutral

Intel,Pixar movies will sometimes take the better part of a day to render a single 4k frame on a render farm. So the fact that Cyberpunk takes more than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame in its path-tracing mode on a single 4090 clearly means that it's unoptimized garbage! /s  EDIT: Apparently people in this thread don't understand sarcasm (or don't understand how a path-traced game can take longer than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame with high-poly path tracing and still be optimized).,Negative

Intel,"CPU PhysX back then was single-threaded and relied on ancient x87 instructions if I recall correctly, basically gimped on purpose.

But, probably makes more sense to have it all on one chiplet, and just use many of the same chiplet for product segmentation purposes instead.   A separate PPU did make sense tho, I'm still annoyed that the nvidia ageia deal essentially kill the PPU in the cradle. Our gaming rigs would cost more if PPUs became a thing, but we could have had a lot better physics then we do today. There is still a revolution in physics to be had some day...",Negative

Intel,"That's true, but if he's talking about *the equivalent* of a current $200-class card, I'd say about it's 10 years, what do you think?",Neutral
Intel,At least with the 4090 you can run 70% power target and still hit insane FPS while only pulling around 300w which is the same as my old 3080. The gains with that extra 150w are a couple percent at best. Not worth it to me.,Negative

Intel,"Weird argument.  Traditional raster is cheats upon cheats upon cheats already.  In fact, all of the lighting entirely in raster is essentially cheats.",Negative
Intel,It will not work well/look good using a single frame worth of data either due to the low ray counts. Digital Foundry has shown Metro Exodus builds the lighting over ~20 frames or so and it seems like Cyberpunk is even more. Even Cyberpunk ray pathtracing doesn't look as good in motion due to that same build-up effect.  You need to cast 20-50x the rays to have enough data for a single frame but then you will be measuring the game performance by seconds per frame.,Negative
Intel,"RT looks significantly better than raster when it’s not just using simple reflections like a Far Cry 6. Raster is all cheats, the so called reflections are essentially rendering the scene or part of the scene being reflected in reverse then applying fake material effects to mimic metal, water, etc. Raster also takes HUNDREDS to thousands of person hours to get the fake reflections and lighting to look decent to good. That’s why devs love RT and want it to grow, as RT/hardware does the work for them.",Negative

Intel,It's not a perfect way of measure but you can clearly see how (at least on Nvidia GPUs) the 8/10GB cards are way behind the >11Gb cards. Meaning you need 11 or 12GB of VRAM for this scenario which cripples the 3080 but not the 3060.  We said from the start these configurations are shit but no-one listened. There you go.,Negative
Intel,The crypto miners did me a comical solid by preventing me from acquiring many countless times and hours I wasted (came from a gtx1070 before finally being able to upgrade). Was able to get my 6900xt eventually for around $600 with 2 games. Becoming increasing thankful for the extra Vram these days.   Once I start getting through my game backlog and into the gard hitting ray tracing ones will hopefully upgrade to something with at least 24gigs of GDDR# lol.,Positive

Intel,"I expect path tracing support to be the exception for a while because most developers will consider the non-trivial dev time to implement it not worth it. However, I'm sure Nvidia would be willing to throw dev help at most developers who would be willing to implement path tracing with their help.  Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090). That's substantially faster than than how fast a 4090 runs Cyberpunk on the path tracing mode. Presumably, a less complex world helps, but they may also have implemented opacity micro maps, which I'm not sure if Cyberpunk has done in the 2.0 update. Perhaps they're cherry-picked examples for the trailer.",Neutral

Cyberpunk is demanding, and takes advantage of lots of tech available for upscaling and ray tracing and frame generation. AMD card’s currently do not match Nvidia’s in those categories, not even close. This us not an attempt to showcase Nvidia tech, but it does take advantage of it.",Positive

I wanted better cooling performance after upgrading to the artic freezer 7 as well with those weird crapy plastic tension clips you pushed in manually, fearing bending them (worse than the stock intel cooler tension twist lock).

Was trying to maximize performance as back then core 2 duo and the extreme versions were king and they had way higher single core clocks and were easy to oc. Wanted the multhreaded for Crysis, LoL (back when you had to wait 5min+ to get into a game), BF2, and was eventually playing TF, Day of Defeat and Natural Selection.  My upgrade back then was to the Evga 560ti DS, which I ended up installing a backplate and  a gelid cooler. They had wayy better thermal tape/individual heatsinks for the memory/vram chips for the heat transfer.

Intel,Anyone who owns an Nvidia GPU should be ashamed of themselves tbh.,Neutral
Intel,"There was more nuance to that ""bugfix"" than just ""it was a bug that got fixed""   Modders were able to re-enable the AMD/NVIDIA PhysX combo basically immediately via editing DLLs.  Not driver replacements, but actual DLL tweaks.  The speed at which modders were able to fix what NVIDIA ""broke"" combined with the public outrage put them in a funny legal spot.  If they continued with PhysX disabled and claiming it was a bug then the bug can easily be fixed, as shown by modders doing it first.  So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.  Obviously not many modern games use the GPU implementation of PhysX anymore and the performance difference between current GPU and CPU implementations are negligible anyway, but their intent at the time was clear once it was shown how quickly modders were able to get everyone back to normal.",Neutral

Intel,I like how you said: static image  because in motion upscaling is crappier,Negative
Intel,"It isn't a weird argument. Rasterization is premised on approximating reality, while RT is simulating it.  The extreme few amount of rays we trace right now, including bounces, means effects are often muted and the performance hit is enormous. To compensate, we're using temporal upscaling from super low resolutions *and* frame interpolation.  Temporal upscaling isn't without it's issues, and you know how much traditional denoisers leave to be desired. Even Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction leaves a lot to be desired; the thread on r/Nvidia shows as much, with ghosting, artifacts, etc. all over again. It's like the launch of DLSS 2.0.  All of that, for effects that are oftentimes difficult to perceive, and for utterly devastating traditional rasterization performance.",Negative
Intel,"It's a shame raster is so labor intensive, because it looks so interesting when done right.     I look at screenshots from cyberpunk, Raster / Ray Trace / Path Trace, and in most of them the raster just looks more interesting to me. Not constrained by what would be real physical lighting. The 100% RT render versions of old games like Quake gives a similar feeling.     But I imagine there will be more stylistic RT lighting over time, it saving a ton of labor is all things considered good, freeing it up for actual game design.",Positive

In HDR that ""bloom"" looks awesome as it's super bright like it would be in real life but still not losing any details. You lose those details only on those SDR videos.  PT just looks and feels way more natural than just RT, when only raster literally looks like it was two different games from two different hardware generations.  Once I saw Cyperpunk PT there is no way I'd imagine playing this game in any other way. All other games look absurdly ugly next to it now. It's something like when you get a high refresh screen and can't look back at 60Hz anymore.",Negative

It is not a gimmick that a company has developed a superior technology that allows the game to be played at almost the same quality as native, significantly smoother and faster. You’re in denial if you think otherwise.  I’m not tied to either brand. I have an AMD CPU bc it was the best option for what I wanted, and a Nvidia GPU for the same reason.

The 4060ti gets 6.6 fps. Let's assume a next gen flagship is able to reach 60 fps at 4k. That would theoratically allow the 60ti card to reach around 20 fps.

But maybe DLSS 3.6 will solve those.  I do feel DLSS itself has also improved in the past few years in terms of ghosting and performing at lower resolutions.  On a 1440p monitor these are the starting point resolutions:  - Quality: 1707x960p - Balance: 1485x835p - Performance: 1280x720p - Ultra Perf: 853x480p  So even the highest quality option is sub-1080p.

Intel,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",Neutral

Intel,"There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Not because upscaling, but also because how important is to have drivers that work in tandem with specialized hardware units in the GPU.  Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  AMD fails hard on 2 of those things.  Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.",Positive
Intel,"Yep, XeSS is just great, I happily use it in MWII on my Arc A770. But I still use DLSS on NVIDIA. But both are better than FSR.",Positive
Intel,"Then you should be looking at ***GPU*** usage, because CPU usage will not help you answer any of those questions",Negative
Intel,"Problem is, by itself it still tells you little to nothing. If GPU utilization drops like a brick you know something is bottlenecking. If CPU utilization changes in the absence of other data you know absolutely nothing of value.   The real kicker is the CPU utilization may not even be ""wrong"", it may just be polling at a very low rate because that's the other thing with these OSDs if you poll too frequently for up-to-date data that can kill performance from the overhead.",Negative
Intel,"> There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  Yep, tools like [this one from NVIDIA](https://youtu.be/-IK3gVeFP4s?t=51) have made it easier than ever as a dev to optimise for NVIDIA hardware.  > AMD fails hard on 2 of those things. Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.  Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts. Arc is just getting started, give Intel 5-10 years of time in GPU and they will outpace AMD for sure.",Positive
Intel,"There are many settings that directly impact CPU usage, so of course CPU utilization reading can be useful.  Not everything needs to be precisely accurate, this is a lousy defense. Getting 0% reads all the time is entirely worthless but some accurate reads is still useful information.",Neutral
Intel,"You are going out of your way to defend a broken feature.    7800X3D shows up as 1% CPU utilization during games such as Watch Dogs, Stellaris, Age of Empires. Clearly broken. Undefendable.",Negative
Intel,"And with a bit of luck, they will also hit AMD in the console market.  Right now AMD stays afloat GPU speaking because consoles, they were during a lot of years the only vendor offering both CPU and GPU in a single package, reducing costs A LOT.  Nvidia was not able to compete against that with the lack of CPUs and Intel with the lack of GPUs.  Now that Intel is working on dedicated GPUs they are going to eventually create APU like products, its just the natural outcome of producing both CPUs and GPUs.  And then AMD will NEED to compete against them instead of being the only option.  And if that happens, unless FSR gets turned into a hardware specific tech like XeSS that falls into different techs depending on the GPU its running on, AMD will be murdered.  Better software stack, better general hardware to accelerate and improve upscalling keeping costs down AND being a second player pushing prices down towards Sony and Microsoft?  AMD will be screwed up if they don't up their game. And hard.",Neutral
Intel,"Right, so what kind of useful information can you tell me if I raise graphics settings and CPU utilization goes from 12-16% to 16-17% while framerate goes down from 120 fps to 110 fps?",Neutral
Intel,"All CPU utilization tells anyone is thread scheduling, and nothing about what the threads are or aren't doing. Like the only situation that it marginally tells someone anything is how many threads a program uses. But that usually doesn't fluctuate with games, games usually scale up to <x> number of threads and that is that. GPU utilization is the one that is far more useful for spotting bottlenecks, general performance observations are far more useful for tweaking.  Even Intel and co. will tell you that with modern processors and all the elements they contain as well as hyperthreading/SMT CPU utilization isn't a very useful stat anymore. Meant a whole lot more when CPUs were one core unit and didn't also include the FPU and memory controller and everything else.",Neutral
Intel,"Cause unfortunately even if it wasn't broken, it's not useful in any meaningful capacity. Should it be broken? No. Would anything notable come of it if it were fixed? Also no. Given the bugs they got and room for improvement elsewhere it's one of those things that should be super low on the priority list or just removed wholesale.",Negative
Intel,"That whatever setting you are changing does not have much of an impact on CPU utilization, and if your GPU allows, you can use it.  What is the purpose of this question, are you really not aware of any settings that impact CPU usage? Some RT settings have big impacts on CPU usage too.",Neutral
Intel,"The problem you're missing here is that settings that are CPU demanding generally don't have an easily observable impact on CPU usage, if they have any impact at all.  The reliable way to see if a setting is CPU demanding is to turn it up, see the frame rate go down, and then look at how **GPU** usage changed.",Neutral

Intel,"We kind of know where it will land. It will be a 3050M level chip, maybe a bit better, but will have improve scaling and frame gen.   8060S is 40 RDNA 3.5 units. One Xe3 unit is about 2.1 RDNA 3.5 units. That put it at about 65% of Strix Halo, though it will have a worse memory bus and no MALL cache. Somewhere in that range.

Intel,"While I haven't used it daily or anything, and I've only done initial setup on the Lunar Lake, the feedback we've gotten both on Arrow Lake and for Lunar Lake (e.g. 268V and 265H) Dell models is that it's a big increase in battery life and performance. The integrated graphics (e.g. 140V and 140T) are very capable compared to a **workstation** grade NVIDIA Ada 500 GPU, but they are not even comparable to a gaming GPU like the GeForce 4060 or even a 5050.  The integrated graphics do however get used for 99% of all workloads unless explicitly specified because they are vastly more battery efficient and draw less power compared to a dedicated NVIDIA chip, meaning you can have a much smaller external power supply, and your graphics performance in those basic desktop workloads with one of these chipsets will be **much** better than previous generation Intel chips. Exceptions are obviously something like gaming or AutoCAD that specify to use the high performance dedicated graphics chip.  140V/140T are barely functional for modern AAA gaming, but if you stay 5-10 years back for AAA titles you might be okay. It will smoke most Indie games. Just look at the per title benchmarks for a 140V/140T and you can see if your game benches. You could probably get away with a lot of functional mobile gaming without a dGPU, but I wouldn't expect to be able to play a recent Call of Duty or Black Myth or anything with anything like an acceptable framerate at a decent resolution. This integrated graphics chip compares very favorably to its more common Ryzen 7 equivalent, I believe the 780M, and it's a very good APU for handhelds overall due Lunar Lake's power efficiency compared to other X86 chips.  You have to understand that for these next two generations Intel seems to be making big strides in terms of both power efficiency and integrated graphics for mobile, it's a very attractive option and the first time I've seriously considered a laptop without a dGPU. I think Panther Lake is going to be a very nice kit next year for both laptops and handhelds and give AMD a run for its money.   I suspect AMD genuinely needs a new APU graphics architecture implemented next year to keep up, which I expect them to. Not a bad problem to have.",Positive
Intel,"Yeah for sure. It's a small die and should be yielding pretty high. See also the number of 4+8+4 SKUs. Looks like the larger CPU tile is also yielding decently, so not a ton to cut down.  I'm partly saying that because a larger Intel3 die was certainly possible.

Intel,> Source?   Common sense suffices. It's a tick core with a clock speed regression at that.,Neutral
Intel,"Surely a cost decision. The 4Xe die, including the choice of Intel 3, is supposed to be the cheapest thing to deliver an acceptable mainstream PC experience. They need PTL to be a proper volume runner and start displacing the RPL that's still a large chunk of sales. WLC should hopefully finish the job.",Neutral

Intel,"Tbh, more cores would just make that go faster, but 16 would already be plenty. Especially for something like that where it's probably going to be a linear analysis and ram constrained if they actually modelled the gas (which would not necessarily be required).",Neutral
Intel,Lmao this is funny we both responded to the same comments with the same things within like 2 minutes of each other.,Neutral
Intel,I don't see anything wrong with asking for actual benchmark information especially when there isn't anything official. X3D is nice but it isn't the end all be all. I would be curious to see if Intel can manage to compete.,Neutral
Intel,"Oh I totally agree, but it would've been nice you know? Jumping to 6 Xe3 is a  significant area increase for a tiny tile. I understand exactly why the 4-10 gap exists, but I can't say I don't wish there was something to fill that gap if only because it looks weird.  I expect the big CPU tile and small GPU tile pairing will find its way into a number of gaming laptops as the iGPU performance is pretty low on the priority list for those.",Neutral
Intel,"PTL's main changes are fixing MTL/ARL's terrible SoC design, which should net a few % performance. It'll see a mild IPC increase, getting a few more % performance. And it'll lose a bit of clockspeed, erasing most of those gains.  Expect PTL to be very similar performance to ARL, but with lower power consumption, a much better iGPU, and most importantly to Intel: Using their own fabs instead of TSMC.  It absolutely won't be X3D in gaming.  Edit: Actually shocked that people think this would compete with X3D.  9955HX3D is \~16% faster than a 275HX in gaming...and a 275HX itself is easily 10%+ faster than a 285H in gaming.  Not even Intel themselves are claiming this. Their own marketing refers to PTL as ""ARL performance with LNL efficiency"". Nobody realistically expects PTL-H to see a 25%+ gaming improvement over ARL-H. The fact that IPC increase is less than 10% and clockspeed is slightly lower than ARL-H should make this obvious",Neutral
Intel,CGC is a LNC tick. This is well known at this point. And we see it's even a clock speed regression.    Even entertaining the notion it will close the gap to AMD's X3D chips is just delusional.,Neutral
Intel,"Oh, yeah, I get you. Wish they could give more granularity. Just personally think some sacrifices are worthwhile if it can condense Intel's mobile lineup back down to something sane again.   > I expect the big CPU tile and small GPU tile pairing will find its way into a number of gaming laptops as the iGPU performance is pretty low on the priority list for those.  Yeah, should be a good fit. Shame they don't have anything with a bit more CPU umph, though. 4+8+4 and only up to 5.1GHz is *fine*, but not great. Especially without an HX replacement.",Neutral
Intel,"Two options seems right, either you care about it or you don't.",Neutral
Intel,"Its not ""delusional"" to want to see actual numbers instead of speculation. I have been in this game long enough to see plenty of speculation even with accurate information not give the actual numbers.",Negative
Intel,"Given how well ARL HX was received in gaming laptops, I think they may wait to have something from NVL take that top spot. 5.1ghz does seem low though. ARL-H will happily do 5.4 and 18A should clock decently, though I suppose that's a sacrifice for the 25W TDP.  I suspect these may not be totally final clocks though they do seem reasonable.",Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, surprised ARL-HX is doing as ok as it is. The deficits of the architecture in gaming are well known. If it could hit the same clocks and core counts, PTL should look a lot better still. And all that besides, ARL's cost structure is horrible. For Intel's own sake, the sooner they move on, the better.   > and 18A should clock decently, though I suppose that's a sacrifice for the 25W TDP  From the same leaker, these chips are at 65W or even 80W TDPs, so they're not merely power limited. It seems that 18A just significantly underperform some expectations, though in line with some rumors and the gist of the revisions Intel's been making to its projections over the last year or two.  > I suspect these may not be totally final clocks though  If they're defining SKUs and such, these clocks need to be finalized for all practical purposes.",Neutral
Intel,"If I'm reading correctly those are max power limits, not the TDP,  though I get what you mean. The 285H sits at a 45W TDP and tops out at 115W. Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  As for why ARL HX is doing well in gaming laptops, I think a good bit of that is also part of what made it lackluster on desktop. It doesn't really scale up that well with higher TDPs and power limits, but it does seem to scale down. The 285HX with its 55W TDP and 160W max limit doesn't perform far off the 125W TDP and 250W max of the 285K.  It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system. The 9955HX3D is very impressive, but quite a lot of laptop buyers seem to value the ability to do more laptop-like things with their gaming laptops than the extra frame rate. I'm hoping this gets shaken up as AMD adopts new packaging tech as seen in Strix Halo.",Neutral
Intel,"> If I'm reading correctly those are max power limits, not the TDP, though I get what you mean. The 285H sits at a 45W TDP and tops out at 115W. Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  Not guaranteed given it's just a twitter leak, but I'm assuming the leaker is using the term TDP consistently with Intel's historical usage, i.e. PL1. For ARL, 115W is PL2. I would also assume there wouldn't be the disclaimer about it being hard to cool if they cut the PL2 so much, though PowerVia does create some interesting complications there, so maybe not quite apples to apples.  Either way though, don't think it should have much impact on ST boost. You're talking a good 70%-ish of power going to compute, so even at 65W PL2, that's still 40-50W available for one core. Should be *easily* sufficient to hit whatever the silicon is capable of.  > It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system.  Yes, and this is something I've very much looking forward to with NVL-HX. At this point, the biggest demerit of the -HX platform vs -H is the use of standard DDR5 vs LPDDR. That's because it's still based on the desktop silicon with the different SoC/hub tile. But with NVL using a shared SoC die, they should be able to offer an -HX platform with the core counts people expect (though probably limited to single die 8+16), but the power/battery life advantages of -U/-P/-H. In general, should help make the -HX more of a straight-up upgrade than the tradeoffs one faces today.  AMD has this situation even worse today, because there's a much bigger gap between their desktop SoC architecture and the mobile one. Though as you say, they may also bring them closer together in the future.",Neutral

Like for like on TDP, this would be a solid improvement given the GPU both has to be moved off-tile compared to Lunar Lake, and has twice as many CPU cores to fight for power.

Intel,"e cores are surprisingly powerful now, and games are getting more multithreaded. It might be better to spread them out over 8 less power hungry cores than 4 P cores and then spill over to the slower cores. Especially in a laptop environment where efficiency matters and the GPU is usually holding back gaming performance so much that CPU performance is really not that important.  In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread. But most importantly, it doesn't do so evenly. Maybe you don't need something assigned to e cores, or the e core task is light and doesn't hold up the other threads. Then things will run at the pace of the P cores, but every now and then you'll have a slowdown.",Neutral
Intel,Wonder if there's some energy star requirements.,Neutral
Intel,"Shouldn't be. That's what the math has always said.  As soon as software can scale to ""many"" cores, the tradeoffs that go into single powerful P style cores are a bad deal. Both frequency and sequential optimizations (like multi-level branch prediction) scale poorly.  Gaming benchmarks tend to have a really strong feedback loop that favors last gen hardware design though. So seeing the benefits to E cores for gaming requires 1.) e-cores exist for a while 2.) some games optimize for them.  Long term, an optimal Intel-style processor design will look something like 4 ""legacy"" P cores + dozens of E cores.",Neutral

Intel,"Really should focus on the Main/Sub thread part. Most games will usually only load up 1-3 cores, with the rest of the cores only used for incidental workloads with lower priority and sync requirements (Multithreading is hard yo, Multithreading with latency requirements is mindnumbing).

I heard that ""games are getting more multithreaded"" like 4-5 years ago, and in most cases, it wasn't true, with more than 8c/16t almost no games scale on CPU-side, and even when they do, in most cases it's a minor improvement over 8c/16t configuration, like 1-3%.",Negative

Intel,"12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark, like actually within error margins next to 7800X3D despite being an older platform with half the L2 of raptor lake and lower clock speed than even 7700X, shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much. Yeah 9950X should outperform it technically I guess but the split L3 between two CCDs probably holds back the advantage of having more cores.  Yeah sadly there's no benchmark for Bannerlord. But supposedly it does disperse its tasks to plenty of threads.   Here's some benchmarks showing core and thread usage in a few games. While the benchmark tool doesn't get into the details of how those software behave obviously, but at least according to the graphs some games like Tarkov really suck at distributing its tasks to several cores but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.

Intel,">12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark  It's because Creation Engine 2 worked better with Intel hardware until AM5 X3D chips, and 12900K great result in this test just shows that it's still a good CPU with 8 Performance cores, not that it's core count matters in any significant way - for example, 7700X delivers identical performance with lower core count/threads.  >lower clock speed than even 7700X  Clock speeds can't be compared between different architectures, different architecture = different efficiency, what matters is IPC.  >shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much  [here's a better example where more intel CPUs are present in Starfield test](https://youtu.be/XXLY8kEdR1c?t=29m5s), as you can see, increased core count/threads past 8 performance cores and 16 thread's is meaningless and won't provide any noticeable performance improvements, 6 faster P-cores on Intel 14600K provided better result than slower 8 P-cores on 12900K.   Going from 7950X to to 7700X results in 5 FPS loss, which is like 2-3% less FPS, and it's mostly because of lower clock speed(5.7Ghz Vs 5.4Ghz boost).   >but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.  That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.  Edit: typo",Positive
Intel,"Well you said that games are optimized for 8/16 and yet gn bench shows 7600X only gets 3-4 less avg fps than 7700X in baldurs gate 3, a highly multithreaded game, it has better 0.1% lows even, though I'm sure that one is a contained incident since BG3 is very dynamic and hence results are not always repeatable. Same with Starfield.   That's because in video games, core count matters less than how fast the CPU can access or manipulate very dynamic types of data in a random memory address.    X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"". They're going to win in old or new games, and they're winning in games because they have a large buffer of low latency data.

Add cache to the chip for the iGPU to use (to make up for the poor bandwidth they get from LPDDR5, even with a wider bus)  If they don't do this then the chip (which again won't fit in their default socket) will be massively bandwidth constrained to the degree that it's pointless.

Intel,"50% is not minor...  Also they said >50%, or greater than 50%. It looks like 70-80% to me.  Since scaling isn't linear I expect 4 Xe3 to come close to Xe2 or even equal it.",Neutral
Intel,Maybe I'm confused about what they're advertising but weren't they just going head to head with 4060s with the b580? Wouldn't 3050 range be a huge step backwards?,Neutral
Intel,"Damn, still behind my old 1060 pc",Negative
Intel,And some of the tiles are internal not on TSMC.,Neutral
Intel,"On-package memory doesn't raise the device price from and end user perspective. It's a margin challenge for Intel because OEMs want the margins from the memory, so Intel needs to pass it along at cost.   Technically, on-package memory can even be cheaper because it can let you simplify the rest of the PCB. Iso-speed, that is.",Neutral
Intel,Are you saying you expect people to not want discrete gpu's in the future?  What about the direction of gaming would make you think that?,Negative
Intel,"> Since scaling isn't linear I expect 4 Xe3 to come close to Xe2 or even equal it.  The 4 Xe tile is on Intel 3, so it'll have a significant clock speed deficit vs the 12Xe tile.",Neutral
Intel,"No I'm talking about the internal game benchmarks they shared. Yeah the GPU architecture  itself is a lot better on paper, but they probably got bottlenecked by the low bandwidth of 128-bit LPDDR5. The uplift in 1% lows in some titles is impressive though.   [power-efficient-gaming-26.jpg (2133×1200)](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-panther-lake-technical-deep-dive/images/power-efficient-gaming-26.jpg)  And yeah I'd not be surprised if 4 Xe3 is going to be closer to the 8 Xe2 in LNL than people would expect.",Neutral

Intel,Well it's not out yet so these are just predictions. Better to be conservative with estimates than overpromise.,Neutral
Intel,"We already knew they cancelled desktop variants though, Panther lake was going to be around Arrow Lake laptop performance no matter what.",Neutral
Intel,"If people can get a XX60ti level iGPU in a laptop, which means you don't have to worry about MUX switches (hardware or software), possibly have a cheaper platform (if scaled) since you don't need a separate GPU board, have access to a ton of RAM (many mid-range GPUs are RAM limited), and due to reduced complexity and the ability to better dynamically manage power can get a more effective slim chassis with less throttling... then yeah, it'd be pretty good.  The next big jump is LPDDR6 which looks to potentially hit a 50% bandwidth increase and marginally lower latency.  Combine that with a wide bus and you're looking at enough to power a XX70 series mobile chip.  The framework is immature but it could be competitive in the future.  We'll see!",Positive

Intel,"I couldn’t believe the video I was watching, the thumbnail was pure clickbait. They fixed one game, and improved some others a little.  And NEVER an Intel CPU in sight. I like the B580, but it deserves better ""testing"" than this.",Negative
Intel,The problem is still here. 9060 xt with 5600 is faster than B580 with 9800x3d and B580 still loses 8% with 5600 instead of 9800x3d. Which means that cpu bottleneck starts much sooner for ARC gpu.,Negative
Intel,Will I be ok to run an intel arc b580 and an intel i5 8400?,Neutral
Intel,"Is this related to historically Intel compiler not compiling code efficiently for AMD cpus? Does it also make Intel CPUs overhead better? If yes, then they really fixed something. If no, then they wrote code normally for AMD cpus as well as Intel cpus.",Neutral
Intel,"the B580 is a modern gpu, it should be paired with a modern cpu, preferably an Intel one, going with old school Ryzen cpus is a bad path to take.",Negative
Intel,"The problem is that this title makes it sound like they fixed the cpu overhead issue in every game, but that's not the case. Some games are still affected. Obviously any fix is better than nothing, but depending on what games you want to play, you will still see an overhead issues. It is nice though that in some of the games the overhead problem has been addressed though.",Negative
Intel,"Haven't watched the video, but damn.   If rue, HUB has officially become clickbait garbage. Not outright lying, but intentionally conveying misleading half-truths. Starting at least with the AMD fine wine video.",Negative
Intel,"The exact CPU model is hardly relevant. The point was to show CPUs of a certain power level. Not sure how this makes it less ""real life"" as if all three CPUs shown weren't extremely popular for their time. Also not sure what one would achieve when using Intel CPUs specifically.",Neutral
Intel,"These guys absolutely *refuse* to test with an Intel CPU, it's very weird.",Negative
Intel,"5700x would have made a lot of sense compared to 5600  12400f,13400f should be included as well",Positive
Intel,Exactly. Its nice that some games were fixed but between that and calling the issue (entirely) fixed there is a big gap.,Negative
Intel,"Indeed and it is something very interesting, because the reason the driver overhead is an issue on 6 core cpu's is because modern games use all 6 cores, so if the driver has a big overhead the CPU has nu free cores available for the driver.  Especially Intel CPU's with more (e-)cores in their budget CPU's should probably suffer a lot less.   I would expect an i5-12400 to suffer the same as a Ryzen 5 5600,  But an i5-13400/14400 has an additional 4-e cores to deal with the overhead. The 13500/14600 even has 8 e cores.      I would very much like to see the comparison   i5-12400, i5-13400, i5-13500, Ryzen 5 5600(X)",Positive
Intel,Would not have mattered. the cpu bottleneck in the intel driver is single-thread limited and largely due to draw-calls being stored in system memory as a buffer for the frametime render. (at least as far as my debugging could lead me)  (that's also why its less impacted on ddr5 systems no matter what CPU),Neutral
Intel,"They pushed the 6 core parts too hard as ""good budget parts"" for too long to not keep using them as their reference...  Even when we're seeing games that now have strokes when they don't have 8 cores to play with.",Negative
Intel,"possibly. Honestly weird as hell to not through in intel cpu results with the same gpus so they can see if it's a all cpu overhead issue, or an issue with amd cpus with intel gpu. Like even one game if intel/amd gave about the same performance you could likely rule it out somewhat.  Also weird to say they fixed it if by the sounds of it to say it's fixed if a very limited number of games were updated to work better in also seemingly limited scenarios. That's more like finding a specific problem on a specific game they were able to improve rather than an underlying fix which if implemented should help everywhere.",Negative
Intel,"No, B580 also performed poorly on i5-8400 and 10400 (both are 5600X-esq)",Neutral
Intel,"The driver compiler is for GPU, not CPUs.",Neutral

Intel,Welcome to the age of influencers...,Neutral
Intel,"Nvidia 5000 series has overheads issues even with 5800x3d... like 20% performance hit, you can fix it by capping fps or using Intel cpus. AMD CPUs always act weird when reaching 100% utilization.",Negative

Intel,Then they optimized drivers.,Neutral
Intel,Do you have peer-review data that confirms it?,Neutral
Intel,The video shows the B580 not having driver overhead issues with the 5600X but we don't know if it did previously on anything other than Spider-Man. His tone suggests the 5600X performance used to be worse but he provides no data other than Spider-Man to suggest it was for other games.,Negative
Intel,The fact that a switch from a 5600 to a 5700 with hardly a frequency gain eliminates the overhead issue suggest that is kind of  how games/drivers work.,Neutral
Intel,Which also fixed performance on 5600X,Neutral
Intel,"But that's now how games utilize CPU's.  What you get from games is usually 1 main thread that takes up one big core, then many less intense threads, that may or *may not* utilize the other cores, and to varying degrees. AKA you can have mainthread use 100% of core 0, but cores 1,2,3,4,5 are all 50% used, leaving 50% for other tasks to run freely.",Neutral

GPU launches were incredibly inflated until these last 2 months, so what you think is ""black friday deals"" and ""cheap"" is what was supposed to be its original MSRP lol. Now this price hike is just to artificially raise the price to maintain the same profit margins they've had from the past year out of pure greed. No reason for AMD to raise prices on existing products on shelfs except for pure greed. No reason for RAM manufacturers to not offer long term contracts to large customers and OEMs when they are purposely causing a shortage, except for pure greed. No reason for Nvidia (who does not produce a large quantity of their FE GPUs themselves and relies on AIBs) to not bundle Vram with their dyes to the AIBs that have a smaller profit margin than Nvidia, except for pure greed.  20% of this is speculation of a AI bubble pop, the other 80% is companies seeing blood in the water and hopping on the price gouging train to artificially raise the prices for the whole industry. When all the businesses collude and work together to raise the price of computing power, which is now an essential commodity now that it powers the world, who stops them?

AMD,"Nvidia doesn't keep their prices high because of ""no competition""... they do it because they are greedy as fuck and have always been that way.

They also spent way more on marketing because AMD had to spend huge amounts on CPU   If AMD was making GPUs that were 30% faster than a 5090 nvidia would make a point to still charge more simply because ""DLSS is so much better"" and regards would believe it and still buy them over AMD.

AMD,Source? There is nothing to suggest that's what's happening.   The Ryzen 9950X MSRP is $649.99 at launch (August 2024). I bought it in November 2024 for $599.99. It's currently $539.99 on Amazon. It would take a $110 increase to hit MSRP. This would be a MASSIVE increase and doesn't seem very likely.   My prediction: It'll hit $599 again at most,Neutral
AMD,"RAM prices have to come down. The entire client market, especially OEMs, will be at risk of collapse otherwise.

AMD,"> Nvidia doesn't keep their prices high because of ""no competition""... they do it because they are greedy as fuck and have always been that way.  No, Nvidia keeps the prices high, because they CAN — People buy their cards, without thinking, no matter what.  > Even back in the day when AMD/ATI was crushing their shit GPUs by huge margin they still charged more because they handed out bribes to game developers for years and always got their BS software gimmicks like Phys-X in new games. They also spent way more on marketing because AMD had to spend huge amounts on CPU.  There you have it, the answer on why people buy Nvidia-cards. Not because those would be (always) necessarily better, but mostly out of the market's *brand-perception* — nVidia spent billions to fabricate their leader-image.  Same reason forwhy so many people still stick to Intel and answer questions about their CPUs with *""It's a i7!!""*.",Negative

AMD,"You say this as if their market share hasn't been steadily decreasing over the past couple of years.   What's even worse is that Intel's market share shrink has largely been slowed down by them pushing a bunch of high volume, low margin chips. If you look at revenue share in desktop, AMD is already at 40% share.   Intel's competitive position in desktop has only been deteriorating since X3D came out.

AMD,Its literally close according to every single benchmark but whatever.,Negative
AMD,"Platform longevity has to have some kind of financial value placed on it.   The maximum value of long platform longevity is the price of a motherboard. And you maximize this value if you buy into the very first generation on that platform. So every subsequent generation you enter in, the value of platform longevity goes down.   You also have to consider what impact generational improvements have on platform longevity. Zen 1 -> Zen 3 was a huge jump. Assuming Zen 7 on AM5, I don't think we're gonna see that level of improvement with Zen 4 -> Zen 7.  Let's say someone upgrades from AM4 to AM5 with the launch of Zen 6. They receive less value from platform longevity than someone who entered at Zen 4. And someone who bought in at Zen 4 will likely receive less value than someone who bought in at Zen 1.  So yes, platform longevity does have value. It's better to have platform longevity than to not have it. But best case scenario, that value is the price of a motherboard, and we could argue on the whole that you subtract from that value based on the circumstances.",Neutral
AMD,"1700x was already obsolete when it was released, my 4 cores non ht 4670k was superior for gaming with a basic overclock and it was released almost 5 years before the first gen ryzens.

AMD,"AMD isn't on a better node. And power efficient is a difficult metric to measure because it varies wildly on context: ISO-Performance, ISO-Power, ISO-task that isn't time sensitive (web browsing). It depends on power profile (high-performance will sacrifice efficiency for performance). It depends on where in the efficiency curve you are. It depends on how high in the product stack you are (a 7500F is more efficient in gaming than a 9950X, but may be less efficient in highly threaded productivity apps, etc.)  edit: Downvoted for being factually correct. You don't just run CB24 at full power and divide scores to determine efficiency. That's way too simplistic.",Negative

AMD,"Time is also a factor, the amount of time I spend swapping a motherboard is far more than the time I spend swapping a CPU.       Also potentially getting a bad motherboard if I was also swapping a motherboard (has happened twice).       That means loss of more time and effort to reinsert the old motherboard, RMA/return the new board, and then swap the board again again if I manage to get a replacement. Getting an RMA repair/replacement again isn't a 100% guarantee in this day and age with how stingy companies are. So I mean depending on how far you want to take this. By the end of this I could be out an extra $100-$200 in time.",Negative
AMD,"IDK about anyone else, but I had some bad experience with intel and wanted to support AMD. Helps I got the x370 Taichi motherboard as a gift.

AMD,> What's the actual time difference of install of just a CPU vs Mobo + CPU? 10 minutes?  With all the stuff you have to disconnect/rehome/recable? I think for the average home builder closer to an hour.,Neutral
AMD,"Maybe for an experienced builder, but to me (someone who's only built 1 PC) the prospect of just changing the CPU seems like a far less daunting task.  If you just want to replace the CPU, you unscrew 4 screws to remove your cooler/AIO pump head, pop open the socket, put your new CPU in, repaste and remount the cooler, plug some fans back in if necessary, and you're good. Maybe remove the GPU if you're really pressed for space.  When changing an entire motherboard, you have to unmount the cooler, remove the GPU, unplug every cable plugged into the motherboard, possibly remove some AIO fans/the radiator (or just fans in general) from the case if they're getting in the way of the motherboard screws, remove the motherboard, and remove any SSDs you want to reuse.   Then you have to put everything (CPU, SSDs, RAM) on the new motherboard, put the new motherboard in, repaste and remount the cooler, remount any fans you had to take off and plug them back into the motherboard, plug all your PSU cables again, then put your GPU back into place.  You basically have to redo a big chunk of the entire build process. Not to invalidate what you said, maybe you are proficient enough that all that would only take you 10 additional minutes. But I would not bank on the average DIY PC owner being able to do all that so quickly.",Neutral

AMD,"QC for PC parts seems to have been rather lax lately, I received a board with multiple damaged pins, and another one with a bad bios, I also got a bad CPU. This was all on the build I did around this time last year. Because of these issues it wasn't up and running till February. I also remember when I was a young teenager I got a bad board from Frys in the late 90s. My friend also received an Asrock board a few months into 2025 that basically melted with stock settings.  For some on compact builds multiple hours. Multiple factors go into this. Swapping a motherboard can be a major PITA.

AMD,"True, and I recommend people get cards based on their needs/desires, never blanket recommend 1 company over the other.  I’m just surprised it’s AMD who might raise prices before Nvidia, even if they can absorb some of the cost.",Negative
AMD,That's only a rumor and has not been confirmed.,Neutral
AMD,"Why are AMD's margins slimmer?  They're manufacturing at the same place using very similar technology. Their equivalent product is actually a little smaller than Nvidia's in terms of die size... they're a big TSMC customer, while obviously not as big as Nvidia they're not some small timer who can't negotiate a favourable deal either.  On this basis I would assume AMD and Nvidia have very similar margins on GPU sales to board partners.",Neutral
AMD,"Whelp if that rumors become the truth, then it is definitely right to expect the Nvidia GPUs will also get a price increase, i just wonder when it will happen and why AMD did it first with their RDNA 4...",Neutral
AMD,">expensive piles of scrap while making Apple now seem like a value proposition.  But Apple does have insanely good value though. Like no shit, no humor.  You can get Macbooks for dirt cheap now and the M4 and M5 chips are absolute fucking powerhouses, they've got the best ARM silicon on Earth as we speak.  The iMac is an all-in-one PC with good hardware (M4 chip), an excellent display and extremely good build quality. It's not insane at those prices but it's still, I'd argue, very decent.  The Macs above that are truly expensive I'll give you that but they're meant for companies so not really a consumer thing.",Positive
AMD,"I doubt Nvidia will raise prices they will most likely just stop producing FE""s. Which isn't the same as eating the cost or raising it.   Then AIB's will most likely raise pricing. That isn't due to Nvidia thats AIB's doing what they gotta do.   As far as priority gaming has never been the priority for Nvidia this generation. There priority is AI chips. Everything else is secondary to that.   AMD CPU division is basically printing money now. They want there GPU division to go anywhere. There going to need to be more competitive, right now there not.   They don't offer a better software stack, Ray tracing or anything to match the 5080 in performance. They also have a reputation of dropping support a LOT sooner then Nvidia  That means they need to become a value leader and why in the world would you pay the same or more for a 9700xt over a 5070 Ti?   Specially if the two are with in 50 dollars of each other or even 100 dollars of each other.",Negative
AMD,"Sure, but how often can you predict something will drop that much? When the 5090 was announced didn't people sell their 4090s for as much as they bought them or slightly more? Also, if I'm going to use a GPU for 3 months, I'm not going to wait for it to drop in price.",Neutral
AMD,>95% will never use it  And the other 5% could use 4 or 100? Or is the XTX too cheap for that?,Negative
AMD,"Also means there's probably going to be a lot more variability in performance from vendor to vendor than we're used to, due to the sourcing of VRAM potentially being from different places.",Negative
AMD,Nvidia is also likely in a position where can get better prices on memory than AMD. So they might not be facing reduced margins yet.,Neutral
AMD,Im surprised that people even consider AMD its not priced well against Nvidia and Intel is coming hot on its heels. Their attitude towards consumers is frankly appalling considering that they are just fighting for scraps in this space,Negative
AMD,"Why is it ok to talk about AMD rumors but not NVidia ones?  The seemingly official quote in this article is clearly at least partially wrong:  It states no new products through 2027.

I think in both cases these rumors are likely true, but may be a bit off given that both are sloppy third hand leaks without any confirmation from the source or quality multiple sources.",Negative
AMD,"They have far lower market share, they most likely price their stuff with a lower margin. Nvidia can do whatever they want.",Neutral

AMD,"Nvidia has a 378 mm2 GPU that has a MSRP of $1000 and $750, while AMD for the same die size has $550 and $600 MSRP. In this case, nvidia makes between 50-80% more $$$ per die.  Nvidia has a 260 mm2 GPU has that a MSRP of $550, while AMD has a 200 mm2 for $350 and $399.  And so on....  A wafer of chips produced at TSMC generates nvidia much more money that AMD's one, even though the prices per wafer must be similar.",Neutral
AMD,"The 9070 XT is priced closer to an RTX 5070 right now, performs like a 5070 Ti but is much closer in terms of hardware to an RTX 5080.

AMD,"The 5080 die is the same one as the 5070 ti, which is the direct competitor of the 9070xt and sells more than the 5080. Average margins will be slightly higher for Nvidia, but not by much. Especially considering AMD uses GDDR6.",Neutral
AMD,"Ah, I was comparing 9070XT to 5070Ti.  They're all remarkably small dies but I guess that's progress.",Neutral
AMD,"Certainly NVidia has notably higher margins here, but you're likely over estimating it somewhat.  GDDR6 and GDDR7 do not have the same cost.   The overall board cost is also influenced by cooling and complexity of the board traces / power circuitry (though, not by that much).    Additionally, Its not clear how much of the actual sale (vs MSRP) NVIdia earns vs AMD -- there are various people making profit between them and the consumer.  We also know that NVidia sells the vast majority of its gaming GPUs not directly to consumers but to OEMs for pre-builds.  We don't know if NVidia sells GPUs to those OEMs at the same price they sell to D2C retail brands.  Do the big OEM system builders (NVidia's largest customers) get bulk discounts others do not?",Neutral
AMD,Oh they're about £100 or more different in price where I am.,Neutral
AMD,"That's right.  Also, the only thing that can outpace an M5 chip right now is the Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme. The M5 is in newly released Macbooks available for like $1,350 I believe, while the X2EE is going to be in some fucky-ass ultra high end Windows laptops priced at well beyond $2k.

AMD,"Depends on price. Word on the street is that AMD gave Valve a reaaally good deal on 7600 dies.   Essentially it appears that AMD produced way too many Navi 33 dies, using an older node (6nm) to make them cheaper and more plentiful, expecting to put a lot of them in laptops. Apparently, OEMs preferred the more expensive (and more efficient) 4060 instead, and that left AMD with lots of Navi33 (RX 7600) dies on their hands.  Talking to AMD Valve probably saw an opportunity to take this excess capacity for cheap, and AMD saw an opportunity to recoup some cost, rather than risk throwing them away. I can imagine Valve getting those RX 7600 cards for maybe half the price of what a 9060XT would be (depending on memory prices).",Neutral
AMD,"Probably would have cost $100 more, but I think it would have been worth it. Almost PS5 Pro performance would have looked better. Plus better upscaling.",Positive
AMD,"All is forgiven if the steam machine is under $500. Anything more, and yeah, i agree.",Neutral
AMD,"Would have made a lot more sense.  Would have been first of it's kind though, no ODM with existing designs to produce the board, AMD clearly do not want this chip in anything other than add in boards etc.  It's strange since it seems like it would be a good chip for laptops, mini PCs etc.",Neutral

I told em valve is smart financially and will never do that and will just do the same exact thing as the steamdeck, pick an existing chip that AMD needs to dump off at an exceptional price. The 7600 system that's leaked will be what you see and what you get.  Well well it's almost as if that particular redditor does not have any business experience at all and valve is a multi billion dollar for multiple reasons including being financially smart.",Negative

AMD,Sure if its a really good price it makes sense..,Positive
AMD,"And for this, I expect Steam Machine to be in a reasonable price range. It’s the same for both Machine and Frame, there are very clear signs of compromises for cost purposes that Valve didn’t take for something like Index.

AMD,Eh. I'm betting on $600 for the entry level version and $750 for the 2TB version.,Neutral
AMD,"How is this even possible. The individual components today cost more than $500, not to mention the 2TB option will be easily more expensive than it was when the Steam Machine was first announced.",Negative
AMD,The fact that they’re using salvaged Navis means they’re selling jack shit 7600m dies. Which is to nobody’s surprise given how few laptops exist with 7600m. Oems do not want amd dgpus on their laptops.,Negative
AMD,This would make the SM $100 extra and for sure the CPU would have been a bottleneck for this card.,Neutral
AMD,Why?   This is a 1080p card.   8GB is sufficient for its performance.,Neutral
AMD,think thats why they did the rx 7600M,Neutral

Even non-RT loads required very low settings.  New games are going to really test that hardware, I think RT is a total non starter on it as well.",Negative
AMD,Exactly.  I wouldnt consider a 3060 useable without dlss working wonders.  Especially at 4k where you need dlss performance or ultra performance.  Trying to do that without a proper upscaler is going to produce hideous results.,Negative
AMD,"$1000 also isn't a great look for a console killer. Between Sony releasing the PS5 Pro at a really steep price ($750/€800), both Microsoft jacking up the Xbox Series price (X for $650) and Sony doing the same (PS5 for $550) and Nintendo charging quite a bit more for the Switch 2 ($450) I'd say there's an opening here for a Steam Machine to enter the console market.  If Valve can release something that can compete with these consoles, at a similar price, with a similar feature set, but with also all the advantages of being a computer, then it's definitely worth it. Going from $1000 to $700 will open a huge market for Valve. Going to $600 would be the nail in the coffin for Xbox.   No online fees, lower game prices, your game library will never expire, infinite game catalogue, and you can use it as your main PC as well, for the same price as a normal console... Not a bad sales pitch.  BTW, lots of people are using a Steam Deck as their main console. If millions are happy with Deck performance, this is more than enough. If you want better, build your own, unlike with classic consoles, you can easily do it now.",Neutral
AMD,I doubt there are enough defective ones to be all salvaged. It'll be like the consoles where they're cut back to ensure as many dies can be used as possible,Negative

AMD,"If the 9060XT can utilize 16GB, so can a 9060. The performance difference is imperceptible without a framerate counter.",Neutral
AMD,"Plus, much easier to integrate into a smaller form factor than shrinking down a desktop GPU. The Steam machine is basically a screen-less laptop hosting a Ryzen 7640 (without iGPU) plus an RX 7600M, but with a huge-ass heatsink and fan to properly allow for higher clocks.",Positive

No , you re buying cpu, gpu, ram, ssd, mobo, case, power supply  Thats a ton of money.  And the performance wont justify the price at all.",Negative
AMD,"The 4k claim is really weird. On old games, sure. But am 8GB 7600 is a 1080p GPU, which isn't even that bad on a TV, especially since upscaling 1080p content is kind of a TV's bread and butter",Negative

AMD,"Cool, but individual components involve free assembly by you, steam machine needs assembling and to make money.",Neutral
AMD,"Slapping the chip from the RX 9060/XT onto a laptop style motherboard would not be technically any more difficult than using the 7600M chip. The 7600M is itself just a slightly cutdown, underclocked desktop RX 7600 chip.  Both chips are physically pretty much the same size (200 mm2 give or take a few) and the desktop versions have very similar power usage.   The only reason to use the RX 7600 over the RX 9060 chip in this application is cost.",Neutral

AMD,"The steam machine doesn’t need to make money. The steam machine needs to get people to play PC games, which steam has an effective monopoly on. If Valve sells the steam machine at cost they’ll make money.",Neutral
AMD,"I agree, but it's still more work than just slapping the existing laptop board that's already engineered with the proper footprint, connections, inputs and outputs in there, because AFAIK there's no RDNA4 laptop parts at all and the most we have are the RDNA3.5 GPU in the PS5 Pro and the AI APUs",Negative
AMD,Any corporate mention of resolution and framerate is completely meaningless now because it only refers the output. It could be achieved by upscaling from 540p and with 4x frame gen (amd doesn't use it atm) and it still wouldn't be technically lying.,Negative
AMD,Frame gen and upscaling can't solve a lack of VRAM in many games either though (frame gen makes it even worse). Unless they're talking about FSR1 lol,Negative
AMD,"Yes it does, it can't be loss leader because otherwise people will just buy it for office use. They said it themselves.",Neutral
AMD,"Who is buying a steamOS machine for office use? Which office is going to bother buying this instead of any of the hundreds or thousands of offerings from T1 SIs that actually provide support and service? This thing doesn’t even use standard components, are you even going to get official drivers on Windows?",Negative
AMD,"They promoted the steam machine as being able to install other OS. If they don't support it then I suppose at least it would be really funny for how much people glazed them for it.   There will be companies buying it if it's cost effective due to valve eating costs. Hell, even if they don't, valve just have no control over it's userbase, it could have a really low acquisition rate from non steam users, just like steam deck, so all that loss leading would be for nothing.  If you are right then it's a pc, that you can't upgrade, that can't play hugely popular games like league of legends, GTA, battlefield or valorant. Device designed not for casuals and not for enthusiast. Just people who are okay with paying a lot of money to play old, locked in time, singleplayer games on TV. It has to support windows.",Neutral
AMD,"No sizable company is buying a ton of computers to replace the OS on them, especially not for this level of hardware. No normal user is buying a Steam Machine running SteamOS from Steam because they really want a Linux desktop.  The problem with charging a PC price instead of a console price is that it’s just worse than an actual gaming PC. Even with all the advances Valve has made to Linux gaming you still can’t play a lot of popular multiplayer titles, and hardware wise it’s essentially a 5-year old console.

AMD,"The 5070 is pretty good value tbf. It's a little weaker than a 9070, but also sells well below MSRP, which results in similar price/perf. It's also more common in prebuilts. It's also a really big step over the 5060 Ti 16GB (which sells at MSRP) for only a small price difference.  The uninformed buyer gets a 9060XT, 5060, 5060Ti or 5070 prebuilt. As a result the 5070 gets decent market share.  Even as a pc builder myself, the 5070 is appealing in the Swedish market, and if I were in the market for a GPU right now, I'd definitely consider it. It's about 1500 sek/160$ cheaper than the 9070 right now, or 2000SEK/215$ cheaper than a 9070 XT. (5190 SEK vs \~6700 SEK vs \~7200 SEK, or \~550 USD vs \~710 USD vs \~765 USD)",Positive
AMD,"5070s a good card and frame gen pulls its weight depending on games. It was never a bad GPU, just poorly marketed. People KNOW they're not getting a 4090, but I think it is still a viable upgrade for many people for $550 ($450 or less for black Friday). Seeing that the average is a 3060, you're essentially doubling performance or more.  My biggest gripe with the GPU was the 12GB (should have been 16GB). Games like Spiderman 2 hit that limit with ray tracing even at 1080p without DLSS. I felt like I was paying a lot for a card that was obsolete out of the box. Otherwise it was crushing everything I was throwing at it.",Neutral

AMD,"I mean it takes one second to check Amazon or any other major retailer, after which you will see that the 9000 series is selling really well compared to prior generations. 9000 series GPUs are straight up the most popular for DIY systems in several countries, especially outside the US, where Nvidia prices are especially high.  You could also look at AMD gaming revenue in order to make the same conclusion. 9000 series is selling well. It's not Nvidia numbers, but the cards are certainly moving in decent volume compared to the RDNA 3 flop.  Another anecdote is that system integrators seem to be putting more AMD cards in their systems than they used to, likely because the 9060XT is better value than 5060 Ti. Despite that, RDNA 4 numbers on steam are still low.  You can't look at the 7600XT growing from 0.2% to 0.8% THIS YEAR with the 9060XT or 9070/XT not even showing up on the damn list and tell me the data is representative.

AMD,Look at the Linux numbers. It’s overwhelmingly amd.   I do legit think there is a bug in collection on windows.  Not just amd cards but also nvidia newer cards due to a bug many of us think is happening on amd CPUs with an apu enabled.

My wife has a 5900x with 7900xt and a 3700x with a nvidia 960 on Linux.   Steam last took surveys from my systems around June. That was before I got the 265k and 9060xt. (Had a 14700k in windows and arc a750 in Linux) my wife hasn’t had a survey since before she got the 7900xt last year.   I expect nvidia to win as well as Intel on cpu due to Internet cafes in Asia along with trends there on purchases but I still feel like amd and nvidia should have more share on their newer gpus.   Sometimes I wish valve did more breakdowns like what the specs are on systems with current gen CPUs and gpus. (Most popular current builds)  also builds by region.  I except a slam dunk for Intel and nvidia in Asia.  I would expect stronger market for amd in Germany and the US in part because of the Linux numbers,Negative

For comparison 7700XT went from 0.22% in march to 0.26%. 7900XTX was at 0.49% in march, it's at 0.50% now.  Casual clearance sales selling 6x more GPUs that was sold before ""clearance sales"".

But yea, a history of mediocre drivers was another factor. Nvidia's feature set is just better, more more complete and more mature. If I were running Linux AMD would be a no-brainer though. But I'm not, for now... holding on to W10 as long as I freaking can.",Neutral
AMD,"The steam hardware survey represent an installbase, even if RDNA4 was selling well compared to RDNA3 it install rate on gamers  is not as good as RDNA3, i doubt Valve and Steam have any reason to portray RDNA4 on a negative light when they run RDNA2 GPU's and Ryzen CPU'S on the steamdeck and will run a full system on the steam machine.   There is no need to look for conspiracy theories, people may have given the series 9000 a chance but there clearly a lack of every day system users actively playing on them to show on the steam hardware survey compared to RDNA3 or RDNA2 users.   This is also not something new, back when RDNA3 launch RDNA2 cards also increased in terms of installbase which clearly shows that the average AMD GPU user looks for extreme value and will look for retailers clearing their inventory from these old cards over the newer architecture.",Negative
AMD,"I think that's naive, Nvidia have had big driver problems this year.  The 50 series in general has been a real departure from the usual Nvidia experience for many. I think there's a toxic mix of Windows 24H2/25H2 and crappy Nvidia drivers involved though.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah Intel losing 9% to Ryzen in a single year is absolutely dire, you can just see that line in the graph keep dipping in favour of AMD. It suggests new CPU marketshare that Ryzen is absolutely curbstomping Intel's offerings for Intel to still be bleeding so quickly even as the install base begins to approach 50/50. Ryzen is DEFINITELY going to get a majority sometime 2026, no way it isn't happening especially if Zen 6 comes that apparently will be on a new node with 12 core CCDs it'll be a good generational upgrade itself, Intel really won't be able to catch up, maybe keep up from falling behind worse but yeah AMD has the leadership right now in new CPUs. Zen 5 is already significantly faster in gaming and Zen 6 is going to extend it well over Zen 5, vs Zen 4 to 5 where it was Zen 5% and Intel Core Ultra flopping with less gaming perf and still less efficiency along with then recent problems with previous generations made Intel miss their opportunity hard.",Negative

It also shows the 7800 XT share increasing more in november alone (+0.13%)  than any 9000 series card over its entire lifetime (none crack 0.15%). It does not track with sales data whatsoever.  AMD representation is prebuilts was always very low, but has vastly increased due to the undeniably great value of the 9060XT. The 7600XT was a very poor seller, especially in prebuilts, which tend to go for cheaper options, since it was much more expensive than the 7600 and only offered extra VRAM.  Even more absurdly. The representation of the 7800XT in the Steam survey in has grown more in November alone (+0.13%) than the overall market share of any single 9000 series card. (none crack the 0.15% number to make it onto the list). Do you genuinely believe the 7800 XT sold more in november alone than any 9000 series card has since release?  It does not compute. It probably just registers the integrated graphics on the CPU or nothing at all for the GPU. I suspect that Valve just rejects DxDiag data from GPUs that have not been added to the list. I suspect they just haven't gotten around to adding the RDNA 4 cards there due to the change in naming scheme, while the 5000 series was added before release, since the naming scheme was consistent.  It clearly shows decent market share on Linux, which is admittedly likely to be inflated due to Nvidia drivers being pretty bad on Linux. Since Linux doesn't use DxDiag, valve probably has a different pipeline for handling Linux data in the hardware survey, which is why these cards show up there and not on Windows.",Neutral

Regular 7600 that came out long before 7600XT does not show up at all BTW, despite usually being 50% cheaper than XT version and not having proper competition, totally normal. 7800XT was not great value during that time either, 5060TI 16GB is priced closely and generally even cheaper than 7800XT, for 10% more performance very few people will pick last gen AMD card.   > After which they (7800xt and 7600xt) were pretty nicely priced, while all new gen cards sat way above MSRP.

AMD,"If this is software issue, there is software fix. It is also something worth to check.",Neutral
AMD,"Thanks, I suspected this to be the case too, but the behavior is surprisingly undesirable if this were the case. Things are all good until too much data is transferred at a time, where the transfer speeds tank to literally 100-200MB/s between two PCIe 4x4 drives.   This can be easily induced with multiple data transfers happening at the time, but it's not limited to those scenarios. I can plug in a SATA drive to have the third disk drive transferring files to either of the existing two, or start large downloads writing to one of my disks, and the system will be paralyzed with sub 100MB/s transfer speeds across all devices combined.  My mobo's front drive slot is actually PCIe 5 connected to the CPU, and the secondary one is PCIe 4 connected to the chipset, so the hardware should theoretically easily accept faster drives.  While seeking support, I was told it is expected behavior due to IO bottlenecks that aren't restricted by pure bandwidth, but the logic queueing the requests that can get overwhelmed.

Thinking about it, I wonder if they're seeing SLC caches being exhausted if the copies are large enough?",Neutral
AMD,"Thanks for inquiring! By ""over time"" I mean that my transfers can be neat multiple GB per second, and then fall. But the most consistent way of reproducing the issue is by adding additional IO operations (say, also copy to a SATA SSD, or initiate a couple of file downloads) the speeds fall to a fraction of that. They get massacred when I use Opera and enable parallel downloading (which basically downloads each file in bits in parallell), where I can get sub 100MB/s transfers across all disks.",Neutral

AMD,#1 usecase for these in AI is running medium sized MoE models for local LLMs.  And for that they offer a pretty compelling solution. You basically have to spend twice as much to do it with Apple.

AMD,"Companies are valued based on their gross and operating margins. If their costs rise, they also have to increase their sale prices by the same percentage, or those margin rates go down, which reduces the valuation of the company. Distribution and retailer also take a percentage of the product value as their margin. So even if the oem only raises the product price by the higher costs, retailers still increase the price based on the percentage increase.",Neutral
AMD,"The same reason Intel's Lunar Lake was a one-off.  Companies run a percentage profit margin they report to their investors. If they produce a good that costs 50$ to make, and sell it for 100$, then they have a profit margin of 50%. For investors this means that every dollar they put into production results in 2 dollars of capital, which is a good indicator for potential growth, and, of course, potential dividend payout.  If costs increase by 10$, then, if price were left unchanged, their profit margin would sink to 40%. if They increase their price by 10$ as well their profit margin would sink to ~55%. Investors will look at those numbers and conclude that the company is doing poorly: it is no longer able to achieve the same return on investment that it did previously, and they might just conclude that their money can be better spent elsewhere and cancel further investments.  So, a 10$ cost increase results in a 20$ price hike. In reality, profit margins aren't really that high for third-parties like Asus and others, investors can be persuaded that the costs aren't due to mismanagement and companies will take a hit in profitability in the short-run to maintain marketshare (although, again, AIB companies generally run razor-thin profit margins).  Another reason for adding margin to price-hikes is Machiavellian psychology: Gigabyte and others know the way the wind is blowing, RAM prices are going to keep climbing for the foreseeable future and people respond worse to smaller price increases every month than a big price increase every 6 months. So they'll add some padding now, 'worst' case they can drop the price later or give greater discounts during sales, best case they're better insulated from any future inflation.",Neutral
AMD,Money. Corporations are evil and not your friends,Neutral
AMD,">Why does Asus, Gigabyte, etc, get to make $30 more profit when they spend $20 on memory?  Why not?  They operate based on profit margins.  If they're earning a 50% profit margin, then a $20 increase in input costs will result in $30 increase to the selling price.  Plus, just because NAND contracts went up by $X doesn't mean that's what it costs manufacturers, because they're still bidding against each other for actual supply.  If they don't wanna sit there with 0 stock for the next 6 months, they'll need to bid up the price even higher.",Negative
AMD,Because that’s how margins work.  It’s not sold directly from the manufacturer.,Neutral
AMD,"Because they have to maintain profit margins. They aren’t going to take a hit to margin just cause the materials got more expensive.  If you only raise the retail price by the same amount of the cost of building the card increase, then your profit margin decreases.",Neutral
AMD,"Input costs only determine the viable price floor.  The market (buyers) determine the price. They can all increase prices $50 because people will buy it. They’re also now making more profit per unit which nearly always offsets the loss of customers.  Imagine their costs are $80 and they sell for $120, that’s a $40 profit and a 50% return. Costs increase $20 to $100, price goes up $50 to $170, and all of a sudden returns are 70%, and profit per unit has almost doubled. They can sell almost half as many units and be behind in revenue but ahead in profits, which is the most important part.",Neutral
AMD,They have a legal obligation to make as much money as possible. Gamers have shown since the crypto eras and onward that we’ll pay more for hardware than they thought possible. I just saw a whole thread from someone who bought a 5090 to game casually on non-graphically intense titles and do office work. We’ve signaled to these hardware companies that PC gaming is a luxury.,Negative
AMD,They don't. The OEMs buy kits that contain both the GPU die and the memory. AMD charges the OEM a margin on top of the kit cost. AMD and Nvidia typically don't change the margin target when the BOM increases because they typically don't need to do so to meet sales targets.,Neutral

AMD,"Margin. They are targeting a fixed margin (measured in %), not a fixed profit per card (measured in $$). They just had an earnings where they said they want very high margins.

AMD,Because you'll pay for it anyway,Neutral
AMD,"When prices go up, demand goes down, so they're going to sell fewer units. They need to increase price more than their increase in cost to make up for the lost volume.  This is a fairly straightforward optimization problem. Total profit = per unit profit \* volume. There's also a tradeoff between per unit profit and volume: The higher the per unit profit (and therefore sale price) the lower the volume, and vice versa. When per unit profit is zero then total profit is zero, and likewise when volume is zero total profit is also zero. Somewhere between those two extremes there's a point of maximum total profit. Because per unit profit is price - cost, a change is cost is going to have a relatively larger effect on per unit profits, possibly even putting it negative without a price change. This will cause the optimal price point to move towards higher per unit profit, lower volume. This is what causes the price to go even higher than just the increase in cost.  Thinking of it as greed isn't helpful. This is a very straightforward logical deduction. They don't need increased costs to be an ""excuse"" to raise prices, they can do that anyway and they were already doing their best to optimize their price for maximum profits before.",Negative

Suddenly it's a shit deal.   If nVidia made a fixed profit per card, you'd never see anything above a 5050.

Another important thing: it means that if you can spend the additional 10 billion on something with a profit margin of 6%, you should cut production in half and do the other investment instead.       Let's consider time instead of cost.    Let's say you build wooden tables. You get paid 200€ in labour.

AMD,"I'm not sure I like that table analogy. To me it's like you're building a table for 8 hours and getting $200 in labour and praying $100 in wood, tools, etc. you'd probably charge $300 for the table. $100+$200.  33.3% is your cost in parts, and 66.6% is your profit margins that is also your hourly pay in a way.   Now imagine your parts cost went up by $100 to $200. Do you now charge $200+$200? (You pass the cost onto the consumer) Or do you charge $200 for parts/supplies plus ANOTHER $400 for the labour, because you think the 100% increase parts/supplies cost also justifies you getting a 100% hourly wage increase. After all, you want to maintain the same 66.6% margin. $200-$400.   I think in a small business like this, that would be insane to demand you get double the annual revenue and profit margin in salary. If I went from 66k a year annual net income to 133k, because my supplies cost went from 33k to 66k, that would be weird. Now admittedly, you'd sell a lot fewer tables, so you'd probably not hit those yearly goals. But in part that's your own fault for doubling your table sale price.   The second you have investors, it's suddenly justifiable though. Which to me makes the system look broken.  Personally I think what's going on is that that WANT to sell less gaming GPUs. Just like in the example above you might want to sell fewer tables. AMD is filtering their RDNA4 supply to server instead I'd guess.",Negative
AMD,"But at the quarterly reports they do report other numbers.   ""Third quarter revenue was a record $9.2 billion, gross margin was 52%, operating income was $1.3 billion, net income was $1.2 billion""  I believe by maintaining that gross margin of 52%, all those other numbers will go way up, as a result of more cost, while maintaining margin.",Neutral
AMD,"""making less than before.""  Bubble is saying price was originally sold at $100 if it was $20 in parts it goes up $10(imagine no other costs).  Why don't them make it $110 instead of $150.  You are thinking that ""they don't expect to sell the same number of them"" so that means it shouldn't be $150, as economies of scale are smaller so it should be $170 instead.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, fair that. It's all about the what companies think the price elasticity is for their product. If we increase our price by 10%, is loss in number of sold units big enough to make our actual profit/revenue smaller than before the increase? It's all a big guess.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah for me I’m coming from a discount 3070 so I can almost justify the price as is. If $699 holds thru December it becomes $665 factoring in chase 5% PayPal used at Walmart.

AMD,"You analogy makes even less sense, and keep mixing up what you're actually calculating, and muddying the water by adding the materials in there. My point was that it's fair to ask for more money based on how much you've invested, be that either time (hours worked) or money (buying materials)      Philosophically: If my profit margin is 100% based on the labor, an increase in cost of materials has no impact on it.    You ALSO forgot to account for the cost of you time, i.e. how much are these 8 hours worth if I'm not building this table. What is 8 hours at minimum wage? What's 8 hours working for somebody elses company worth? This is opportunity cost. You're just assuming the labour is 100% profit, which breaks real-word profitability analysis.    To make it fair, you should be calculating the cost of hiring someone to build the table, and you then sell it. You're not going to have 66.6% profit margins.  Anyway...  If the parts cost goes up to $200, and my hours worked stays the same, an absolute minimum price would be $400. And especially if you market your services as ""no profit on materials, only work"". You might do this, because sales/VAT taxation reasons like if materials are taxed higher, but labour is lower. So you give a receipt for materials, bill them as paid-for (0 profit) and then bill your work.    This way of doing things, your profit margin technically doesn't change, since the material is expensed at-cost, your business is selling your labor. You're just expensing the materials, not selling it to the customer. It's almost a balance sheet transaction, that doesn't appear on the P&L.  So no, it has nothing to do with investors, it has to do with you disregarding basic finance and looking at labour as free.",Negative

AMD,What is up with the different visuals at the same settings between the cards? The AMD version seems to be missing or have downgraded visuals.,Neutral
AMD,"Well, it seems AMD has something... Sarcasm aside, nice to see DF's input on this 'early look' of FSR RR.  A lot of strange things observed. With the same settings AMD has some things omitted compared to Nvidia, as seen with shadows in a distance, it's quality, as well with objects reflected like with lights (can't say for sure if this an AMDs or dev thing, regardless it doesn't matter to the end user to who's fault).  With FSR RR, the most noticeable spotted difference from at first glance is the retrieval quality and AA from the reconstructed/regenerated scene. DLSS RR is better which shouldn't be shocking. This is due to how AMD does their upscaling passes with RR, as you can choose whatever upscaling method you want with RR and how it can be clearly seen with water reflections. FSR4 Perf is noticeably blurrier than FSR4 Native when comparing the reflections in the water, while it wouldn't matter what DLSS quality setting you use in conjunction w/ DLSS RR. As an aside, I found it interesting how FSR4 Perf had better texture detail on the letters than DLSS4 Perf (that said perhaps could be a sharpening thing outside of the upscalers used).  Moving on, FSR RR has missing features as noted with how reflections should be reconstructed. Reflected objects/scenes do not correctly diffuse, and are sharp throughout (typing this, I use [10:20](https://youtu.be/RuASMLRGFus?si=p1ECIQiTwNLLxeT0&t=617), but interestingly enough w/ DLSS RR, the gun has noticeable artifcating maybe due to the denoiser?). Environments with FSR RR do not have correct contact lighting as seen with the part about the trash can.  AMD does have some things going for it (though, I suspect is more per game basis). In motion, DLSS RR while clearer experiences more ghosting/smearing elements compared to FSR RR. That said, can't be said for the disocclusion aspect as seen with swapping guns with water in the foreground (that said I wonder if this is again the same problem with the upscaler/denoiser pass with FSR RR or if the problems with game settings between AMD and Nvidia has something to do with it like SSR).  There are things to note about performance, but isn't wildly different, so I won't make comments there.  Overall, again strange to say the least. It's obvious FSR RR isn't quite done, which can be worrying considering it's still one part of Redstone. Also, the game itself isn't a good test bed for the feature (as if it only being enabled for MP wasn't obvious enough) as there are bugs and instabilities. I guess, if anything, AMD has a step in the door which will have improvements. That said, isn't quite like with FSR4 in terms of wow. Not only that FSR4 can easily be swapped with Optiscaler and recently in AMD's own driver with most DX12 games. This one seems to be dependent on AMD actually implementing it with games so unless there are workarounds no DLSS RR swapping with FSR RR.",Neutral
AMD,"I was hoping Ray Regeneration was going to be a simultaneous denoising and upscaling approach, they were [investing research in it](https://gpuopen.com/learn/neural_supersampling_and_denoising_for_real-time_path_tracing/) and suggested they had something working in [an admittedly artifact-ridden demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0vLil19mBs&t=21s). Instead this seems to be a spatiotemporal ML denoiser. It's completely decoupled from upscaling so appears to be denoiser pass before upscaling which ends up cutting out high frequency details and reconstructing to a lower res so you don't get that sharp DLSS RR resolve.   At least in it's current form it's not really an effective competitor to DLSS RR, rather it's competing with standard denoisers like NRD. Which makes me worry about adoption - NRD is vendor agnostic, as are most denoisers. I doubt this could be injected generally like Optiscaler since it is decoupled from upscaler outputs and probably designed to run in it's own pass. Maybe it could be modded to run on DLSS RR inputs before upscaling if the algorithm is general enough? While I hope it's better by Redstone showing I don't see how they could improve the detail reconstruction if it's acting before upscaling  Edit: not to undermine what has been achieved here - it's a very competent denoiser, and imo beneficial over COD's default at identical cost. it just doesn't push any boundaries whereas DLSS RR remains surprisingly coherent when reconstructing small RT details or high gloss reflections",Neutral

AMD,"Yeah, IIRC when FSR FG released, the Square Enix game that was poorly received, had frame pacing problems. It was then around when Avatar released FSR FG was solid and at the time in terms of performance was quite competitive with DLSS3 FG's HW accelerated Optical Flow overhead.  Reality is, no one should really expect AMD to have Nvidia features day one or even have parity. It is more so that AMD should have a relatively decent cadence to have said features so that buyers aren't left out.  I am curious on what they have to say. To me RR seems to be more involved than upscaling and FG as there are already a lot of routes for the developer to take to implement the slew of upscaling methods. Adoption will be the hurdle even more so than before",Neutral

AMD,"Which differences specifically? Most of it is probably down to difference in FSR and the denoiser. The softer look of the water on the AMD card actually looks more realistic, you dont get super sharp reflections on water like that in real life.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm guessing the issues with contact hardening is mainly down to how the network was trained, reconstructing glossy reflections from low sample counts in real-time is challenging and one where DLSS RR is obviously better. Because it's denoising at internal resolution, the start of the hardening penumbra will be be softer than DLSS RR even if it should be sharp. Compared to the in-game denoiser I think FSR RR is actually mostly beneficial (except the water which has had all the ripple detail removed and the extreme ghosting with gun disocclusion) and it seems to be free, although DLSS RR isn't horrifically expensive on newer cards. I'm hoping this is a stepping stone to a simultaneous denoising and upscaling solution because the magic of DLSS RR is it's ability to reconstruct sharp ray traced detail even at low internal resolution, something that this multi pass technique probably can't do (although it can be made sharper, [NRD managed it by denoising with a detail recovery pass that respected DLSS jitter](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/NRD?tab=readme-ov-file#improving-output-quality)).  Optiscaler is magic in getting FSR4 in most titles but I fear this technique won't see much adoption at all - denoising passes aren't typically general so this is something that would need per-engine integration. I suppose it could intercept RR inputs (assuming there's equivalent) to do one pass denoise then standard upscale but unless the inbuilt denoiser is terrible it's probably not worth it",Neutral

Reflex 2 is starting to be in the same category of bullshittery, they marketed 50 series on a feature that isn't out in any games and it's been almost a year without the feature. The only difference is NVIDIA won't push out a feature unless it's ready, whereas AMD force it out when its half-baked like Anti-lag which got people banned from online games or as Firefox72 said FSR FG which was broken in a bunch of games on release.

Looks like I originally had the wrong computerbase article, was looking at their main BO7 one not a specific RR article here:  https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/amd-fsr-ray-regeneration-cod-black-ops-7-test.95050/  Was surprised to see that FSR RR had better IQ than DLSS RR in a few cases:  >  In places, FSR R shows even more details in the reflections than Nvidia’s technology, but sometimes it is also the other way around. The image with DLSS RR always remains much more stable. And that's a big win.  Annoying that we don't get identical images anymore for comparisons.",Neutral
AMD,Are they?,Neutral
AMD,"AMD seems to have adopted a ""quiet launch that's basically testing in production"" approach to new feature release. TBF, Nvidia's DLSS ""1.9"" was also done this way,",Negative
AMD,"what was fine wine was less features, but performance tuning of an existing card, which you can argue to be why didn't their driver team just get it right on launch. but it did felt less like what you said.  but with features being like this, yeah far less charitable and its more in line with what you said, they launched the HW without the SW being ready.",Negative
AMD,"I feel like this is also just the hard truth of the economics of the GPU duopoly.  Nvidia can throw an exorbitant amount of money at new issues, solutions and technologies.  It is simply not economically feasible or viable for AMD to compete at the high speed of Nvidia with a fraction of their operating budget.  Now, they apparently have figured out that at the moment, releasing half cooked things to the public keeps them at least in people's mind and gets them mind share, criticism and bugs be damned.  I understand this approach and clearly they thought about this and if it works otherwise they wouldn't do it time and time again.  As a consumer it obviously has pros and cons",Negative

AMD,It's not just missing shadows. Entire reflections are missing. Draw distance also looks lower,Negative
AMD,So what IS it exactly? A new version of FSR? 4.1?,Neutral
AMD,I mean its technicaly already out in Black Ops 7 and it works.  Its not quite as good as Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction tech but its a significan't step up from the baseline denoiser and improves the quality of RT reflections across the board.

AMD,well see in Minecraft,Neutral
AMD,It's just a bunch of ML-based features that enhance RT/PT performance and quality,Positive
AMD,Nvidia equivalent features basically.,Neutral
AMD,"Funny enough, Asrock just mentioned FSR 4.1 on Twitter.",Neutral
AMD,"It's worth noting that Blops7 only has the RR and FSR4 parts of it, and that RR is not on a version 1.0 yet. Redstone should include the following according to AMD:  * **FSR Upscaling:** (Formerly AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution) Reconstructs crisp, high-quality visuals from low-resolution frames.  * **FSR Frame Generation:** Predicts and inserts new frames between rendered ones, delivering smoother and higher frame rate gaming.  * **FSR Ray Regeneration:** Infers and restores full-quality ray-traced detail from sparse samples, delivering sharp, noise-free visuals with reduced rendering cost.   * **FSR Radiance Caching:** Dynamically learns and then predicts how light propagates through a scene, delivering efficient real-time global illumination.    Of these, we already have FSR4, though a 4.1 or something could come out with this. Ray Regen was the new thing previewed in COD so far. We have yet to see FSR4 Frame Gen or whatever the ML-based solution will be or how their radiance caching implementation will differ from Nvidia's.",Neutral
AMD,"Just an important note, BLOPS7's version is listed at .9, so it's possible (or likely) that the official release will bump the version and may have other changes.",Neutral
AMD,"Nvidia has 2 Ray reconstruction versions. The improved CNN model one and the more recent transformer version. The transformer RR is amazing and by far the best denoiser available for video games. The CNN version is overall better than regular denoiser partly because regular denoisers look flat out awful (it's hard for devs to make denoisers), but CNN version does have compromises and some implementations by devs aren't as good as others.   Unlike Transformer DLSS upscaling the RR Transformer model is very punishing on Turing and Ampere but runs very well on Ada and Blackwell.",Positive
AMD,"Thanks for the helpful post, i recommend checking out [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com/) for posting photos. Imgur is cancer.",Positive
AMD,Some other features are more relevant than ray reconstruction as RT is so rarely used even on more powerful nvidia cards due to how extremely taxing it is. Most of use is on older titles with few gens of hardware advancements. Latest games can butcher even RTX 5090 into sub 60fps with DLSS.  Redstone should bring other improvement than this as per older AMD claims,Neutral
AMD,"Not gonna happen, all those are Nvidia sponsored titles (maybe not Indy, I don't remember about that one). Redstone will probably come to Cyberpunk a year after its release and it will be the worst implementation possible. Optiscaler will very likely make Redstone compatible with those games long before their developers do.",Negative
AMD,AC Shadows can be pretty beefy with the RT too,Neutral
AMD,"It's hard enough for an upcoming game to support FSR4 from the start, it would be even harder for existing games to add support for this and maybe benefit 1% of their players.",Negative
AMD,Yeah they need a few big titles at launch at least to show it off. Maybe BF6 when it gets its RT update?,Neutral
AMD,"As if nvidia won't do this, lmao. Everyone with any sort of DRAM will, many already did. We're fucked",Negative
AMD,Nvidia has increased prices for lesser reasons. Stop it.,Negative
AMD,So it is a RT/PT specific upgrade to FSR4?,Neutral
AMD,We have path tracing at home.,Neutral
AMD,Is it possible to upgrade the RR version to transformer like DLSS or are you stuck with the version the dev used?,Neutral
AMD,"Ugh this again. On average modern RT (not PT) isn't really all that taxing on modern hardware. Now we have games that are built with RT in mind, have no legacy raster path and run well even on a 2060 Super like Indiana Jones TGC and Doom TDA. You gotta remember the RT in these games have to run on a PS5 which is weaker than a 2060 at RT, some even run on a series S, hell Star Wars Outlaws has **several** RT effects running on a Switch 2!   If a Series S and Switch 2 can do it how the hell can modern PC GPUs struggle with it. Now if you wanna min max and drop your settings to achieve 200+ fps that's fair but that doesn't mean RT is gonna make a modern GPU explode.",Negative
AMD,"?? Not really, Redstone is literally just Ray regeneration, a new frame generation version, FSR4, and radiance caching. Is there some secret feature That we're all unaware of?",Neutral
AMD,Stop being stuck in 2020. RT is not taxing if your hardware isnt obsolete.,Negative
AMD,"At least not indiana jones, that has locked dlss inputs, so unless theres official implementation, there will be nothing",Negative
AMD,"But like the other user, most people forget it exists.",Negative
AMD,It's not hard at all to support this. Takes some dev time but is basic engine plumbing. What is hard is implementing the real time path traced renderer that these techs are designed to support. But engines that already utilize denoising and upscaling in their pipelines could benefit from it even if they aren't path traced.,Neutral
AMD,FSR 4 is in damn near every AAA game at launch since they released the SDK.,Negative
AMD,"Stop what lol, it's true?",Neutral
AMD,can we not defend any corporations instead of taking sides cuz thats just weird,Negative
AMD,Is that supposed to make it ok?,Neutral
AMD,It has nothing to do with FSR just like how DLSS Ray Reconstruction and frame generation have nothing to do with super sampling. It's really its own thing. They're just uniting these technologies under the FSR name so that it's easier to understand and market,Neutral
AMD,You can override it in the Nvidia App.,Neutral
AMD,"I would still argue it can be (implemented) inefficiently, not for 200fps but for APUs or even to extend say the handheld/Switch2's battery",Negative
AMD,"And those are far more beneficial than ray reconstruction. Barely anyone plays with RT, especially on AMD GPUs anyway. Maybe with like RX 9070 XT in 5 year old games.   Not to mention RT is dying over Lumen and similar software  implementations. So yeah, tiny portion of RX 9070 XT users will maybe use it if the get back replay some older fame - yay...   Better FSR and better frame gen is what benefits most.",Neutral
AMD,"then check benchmarks, lmao..   I won't bother with many examples, but https://ibb.co/SXN9Yyr2  sub 60fps on fucking RTX 5070 Ti at 1440p (DLSS quality) 🤡 My gosh this sub is high on some drugs and doesn't even watch benchmarks, just vomit bullshit",Negative
AMD,"by hard I meant the incentive for dev to do it, as AMD only makes up a tiny fraction of players, and dev time to add it is more or less the same as DLSS, so game studio would just be ""nah just do DLSS and 90% of our player will be happy""",Neutral
AMD,"There's obviously a negative connotation in that comment, as if AMD planned this release to coincide with the price increases. Also a negative inference that somehow the price increases are unjustified.",Neutral
AMD,"You're delusional if you think people don't play with RT on AMD GPUs.  I have a 9070 non-XT (albeit BIOS-modded and disgustingly overclocked, so about on par with an XT). I always turn RT on, and I tend to max it out without issues. I play Witcher 3 maxed out at 1440p with RTGI and Optiscaler FSR 4 at about 90 FPS base. Enable FG and it's hitting my monitor refresh rate, with the base framerate high enough that the input lag doesn't feel bad.  Even Cyberpunk is fully playable with path tracing if you're willing to drop down to FSR 4 balanced. It sits at around 45-60 FPS, or around 90-110 FPS with frame gen. Obviously path tracing doesn't look all that great without an ML denoiser, but it's completely playable with PT on, and will look absolutely stunning once we get RR on AMD, not to mention feel even better if NRC works in the game, since it should yield a 20-30% boost in PT performance.  And remember, a 9070XT will do 10-15% better than my 9070, so RT is absolutely being used on AMD.  Also Lumen sucks ass. It looks worse than proper hardware RT and is only popular because UE5 is popular.",Neutral
AMD,"Unfortunately lumen costs nearly as much as RT and arguably looks worse in every way.  Not sure that makes much sense. Also I don't even get this reply. I said what it is and you say ""and that's enough"". No shit it's enough. I asked you what magical thing you dreamed up that it also had.",Negative
AMD,"Lumen is RT though, but because it's software based it's the worst of both worlds. Massive performance impact while it doesn't even always look better than good raster. The temporal accumulation need for Lumen also brings with it the worst ghosting ever. Low fidelity software RT is absolutely not the future.  In games that actually have hardware Lumen the performance is only slightly worse on good RT GPUs while the visuals are massively improved. In theory at equal visual fidelity hardware Lumen would give you much better performance than software Lumen. That's just common sense as you have extra hardware to accelerate it.       In the couple of games with mandatory RT that have a software fallback you can see that performance decreases significantly when you fall back on the software version.  Epic knows software Lumen sucks when GPUs have good hardware support for RT (afterall there's no reason not to use dedicated hardware) so they're already shifting towards defaulting hardware Lumen in the recent UE5 versions",Negative
AMD,Lumen has both software and hardware implementation. Lumen software implementation is a lot more taxing than ahrdware RT and is in fact advised against. To the point where the latest Unreal version has it off by default.,Neutral
AMD,>shady link  >emoji  Im talking to a 5 year old arent i?,Neutral
AMD,"It was obviously not planned, but it's been nearly 7 years of this shit. While AMD, Nvidia, etc have no control over these big periodic demand spikes, it's frustrating for consumers nonetheless. Also cry me a river when it comes to ""fairness"" in the context of multi-billion $ companies.",Negative
AMD,Why do you think the price increases are justified then?,Neutral
AMD,"Nobody said that, but yknow twist my words for your own benefit",Neutral
AMD,"Which I specifically noted - with exception of some old titles. Barely anyone replay those, it's tiny fraction. Like I've 100% Witcher 3 like 4 times before even they added RT patch. I'm not gonna replay it for the 5th time just for RT alone when I know game by memory. Similarly with CP2077. Small fraction..  Then take any more recent game: https://ibb.co/4wxJjMx4 or https://ibb.co/3yhTtMvw or https://ibb.co/1YxcVNZq and it falls apart, which is where highest player counts are, not in the 2 GPU gen old titles (or even older such as Wicher 3).  So you just also showed you CAN'T READ, because I accent clearly, that it's fine in old game or with very soft RT implementations like RT ambient occlusion found in Dead Space Remake or Metro Exodus.",Neutral
AMD,"HW Lumen butchers performance, check some benchmarks lmao.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-SlJiiaAXo  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1oshjHNTWw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_mqHo3698  30-40%+ gains depending on scene in software mode over hw mode. That's more than generation of HW progress these days.. So stop talking bullshit it costs nothing.",Neutral
AMD,"It's not slightly worse. Look at fucking benchmarks, like The Outer Worlds 2 butchers RTX 5090 when Hardware Lumen is enabled.   And AMD DOESN'T EVEN HAVE GOOD RT GPUs, so what are we even talking about? Niche feature everyone is jizzing over but like 1% of AMD userbase maybe gona use it. Even among high end nvidia users based on multiple polls done for example by HUB, most chose more performance over RT.",Negative
AMD,"lmao, again, watch some benchmarks. HW Lumen is far more taxing, but since you're so smart, surely won't have problems googling some benchmarks",Neutral
AMD,This isn't a periodic demand spike anymore this may be all compute hardware and silicon for the next 10 years.,Neutral
AMD,Why does AMD get criticism for simply following the market standards that Nvidia and their ilk established?,Negative
AMD,Feature parity with Nvidia while also providing more VRAM,Neutral
AMD,Not targeted to you specifically but that's been the obvious sentiment regarding this manufactured outrage,Negative
AMD,"I can very much read, thank you.  9070 does fine in pretty much any RT title, benchmarks show as much. It beats the 5070 in RT, but also has enough VRAM to fully leverage the power it has available for heavy RT.  Your examples are Black myth: Wukong, AW2 and Indiana jones, and only with the most extreme RT settings. The most similarly priced Nvidia card, the 5070, performs worse in two of those three titles. In Wukong, where it's beating it, it's still delivering unplayable framerates due to the fast-paced nature of the game.  It should also be noted that your example benchmarks were produced on PRE-RELEASE DRIVERS. Those same prerelease drivers had launch FSR 4, which had a much higher latency penalty than it currently does. Current drivers have brought huge performance boosts, something like 10-15% over launch performance, even accounting for outliers.  Those performance gains have been especially big in RT games, where the base 9070 tends to beat the 5070 across the board now, while it was hit or miss at launch.  Like yes, the 5070Ti is still objectively better for RT than the 9070 XT, but it's also 25% more expensive. That still doesn't make the 9070 XT a slouch. It's still better than a 5070 in RT pretty much across the board, even where the 5070 isn't being strangled by the 12GB VRAM buffer.  Driver optimizations like opacity micromaps, shader execution reordering, neural radiance caching and an ML denoiser will only ever close that gap to the 5070 Ti further. Admittedly OMM and SER isn't hardware accelerated like on Nvidia hardware, but should still yield decent uplifts. NRC and ML denoising should both bring double digit performance uplifts, however.  People forget that on a pure hardware level, the 9070 XT has 5-10% more theoretical RT compute than the 5070 Ti. It just lacks the software feature set Nvidia has, and a few hardware-accelerated refinements, notably OMM and SER. It is not inconceivable that the 9070 XT could reach parity with the 5070 Ti in RT.",Positive
AMD,"I believe in the first 2 it's modified to even use hardware Lumen. As in the games don't ship with it supported nor did the developers put it in. And the last one is outer worlds 2. Which is known to run like garbage. Note the 50 to 60 fps with the GPU at 35 to 50% utilization.  I don't think these are representative of the overall usage of hardware RT.  Software Lumen tends to look very ghosty especially on foilage and lacks detail, especially in AO.  It's also screen space limited.",Negative
AMD,"Time to bring the receipts.  Software Lumen: [performance2-3840-2160.png (560×1450)](https://tpucdn.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-performance-benchmark/images/performance2-3840-2160.png)   Hardware Lumen: [performance-3840-2160.png (560×1450)](https://tpucdn.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-performance-benchmark/images/performance-3840-2160.png)  A whopping 7% drop in performance for hardware Lumen on a 5090. Thanks for the example. It illustrates very well what I'm talking about. From what I've heard the hardware Lumen in The Outer Worlds 2 is broken but usually it looks significantly better than software Lumen. I think most people would gladly sacrifice 7% performance for that, because usually the difference is like low vs ultra graphics. No massive Lumen ghosting either.  It's funny you talk about AMD not being good at RT but in this game a 9070xt loses less performance than Nvidia: [performance-2560-1440.png (560×1450)](https://tpucdn.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-performance-benchmark/images/performance-2560-1440.png) vs [performance2-2560-1440.png (560×1450)](https://tpucdn.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-performance-benchmark/images/performance2-2560-1440.png) so they're losing 3% performance at 1440P.  It's not that RT doesn't cost a lot of performance it's just that software Lumen is just as expensive as it's wildly inefficient. The 5090 does indeed struggle at native 4K, but it struggles in general and hardware Lumen has nothing to do with it. With how dominant UE5 is you can't actually avoid RT at all so it's funny that you call it a niche feature. It's like I'm arguing with someone from 2020.",Neutral

Keep that in mind if you have a lot of windows open. Especially if you are one of the strange people who like to maximize your file explorer window or something like that.

AMD,"(Peak) Multi-thread performance is not necessarily the right way to look at the addition of more cores. Software support is just not mature enough with most approach still just trying to parallelize one task even well beyond reasonable scaling, making large core counts seem useless.  Once core counts where naive scaling approaches break too often become common, we'll start to see a shift revealing more benefits of having a lot of cores. Task preemption which was the foundation of modern complex systems may be eventually demoted to a last resort solution for keeping misbehaving processes in line.  Spreading processes to different cores generally reduces the peak performance requirement, so cores can be operated at a lower frequency, with lower voltage greatly increasing efficiency.  Tasks sticking to specific cores without getting preempted and moved around also increases efficiency, and reduces the occurrence and impact of worst case latency penalties.  Software is just way too behind hardware, but throwing faster hardware at the problem still works, so problems are not getting fixed. For example it's amusing to see that single CCD AMD CPUs are the most common for gaming, not because they are good enough, but because dual CCD CPUs just perform worse for the average gamer.  A Linux gaming setup with a container and/or Wine limited to a single CCD with the other CCD being used for the rest of the system is the superior approach to Windows bloatware services and background processes competing with the game for the resources of the same CCD, but the later is what's the easiest to setup/get for most users, so that's what they will plan builds for.  A lot of games also just spawn one software thread per hardware thread per thread manager, which stops reasonably scaling after a point. It may be worthy to even attempt to lie about having only 8 hardware threads, then spread around the mess on 8 cores with SMT more efficiently handling the overcommitment.  Browser loads may not be even worthy of a lot of analysis. Website design regressed to the point where latency hiding is intentionally prevented, and an incredible amount of bloatware logic is expected to be processed serially.",Negative

AMD,it'd be an improvement over Zen ±5%,Neutral
AMD,"I wouldn't be so sure. The big thing with Zen 6 is the new IO die, which severely constrained desktop Zen 5. This is why you saw ""zen 5%"" to begin with, really. It's part of the reason X3D was so good Zen 5 too: it can bypass the memory constraints for longer due to bigger cache. In heavy RT loads tho even the 9800x3D gets pummeled due to the infinity fabric constraints (see: Outer Worlds 2) once the cache fills your memory gets thrashed and FPS goes to toilet.   If they can get the new sweet spot with infinity fabric to, say, 8000 MT/s then even with Zen 5 cores in the thing you'd see pretty big perf gains just by that alone. It's why Zen 5 was huge for data center who can run up the score with shit like 12 channel RAM to get around bandwidth constraints a lot easier.",Neutral

AMD,"AMD and Intel do this all the time, the graphs aren't representative, they're just graphics that don't convey the meanings people read into them. Past AMD charts have done the same, and if you ignore Zen+ then every generation has been a solid two year cadence. Lastly, new nodes  don't happen every two years anymore, and since AMD is going to be the first customer on TSMC's N2 with Zen 6 then TSMC is still going to be on N2 a year later.

I know Zen C/dense chiplets were kind of exception to this, but that's solely for increasing datacenter core scaling, so I can see why they did that.

AMD,"It's harder, but ST is still the most important factor for the vast majority of consumer users(and of course is still relevant to MT performance itself, too).

We definitely should not be happy if they think just pushing more and more MT performance will be compelling for consumer processors.",Positive
AMD,"Single CCD CPU's are most popular for gaming because they are more affordable than higher core count options that wouldn't even provide them much in the way of meaningful benefits even if they were still on a single CCD.  You can say this is on software, but devs still have a hard time even getting good scaling going from 6 to 8 cores, and it's not simply them being lazy about it.  It's just gaming workloads are very hard to parallelize on the CPU end.  Moving to 12+ core CCD's is not going to change much here.",Positive
AMD,"They're saying that for consumers, more and more MT performance from where we're already at is a lot less useful than more ST performance.  So they're hoping that they aren't going to keep pushing more MT performance that is easier to get, while deprioritizing ST performance gains.  And mostly, I'm with them on this.",Negative
AMD,"But why? What task can benefit from scaling up from 8 cores to 10, but doesn't benefit from scaling with even more cores?",Neutral
AMD,"The vast majority of consumer devices do not have a dedicated GPU. We had this issue before, where AMD had to start including iGPUs with every CPU because they lost tons of clients otherwise since there are a lot of systems without dGPUs.",Negative
AMD,"> That's fine, but GPU's are much more capable in that regard.   This very much depends on the GPU.  But either way it is the same argument.

AMD,"The \`c\` cores are rumored to have the same size L3 available per CCD, but there may be less L2 per core.  That L3 will be clocked lower than the L3 on a P core, and be shared amongst more cores, so per core L3 bandwidth will be down, as will per CCD L3 bandwidth.  For many cloud use cases, this is a good trade-off in exchange for essentially lower cost per CPU core; I'd say somewhere between 2/3 and 3/4 of general purpose cloud use cases are not performance sensitive enough to need full P cores or those with high clocks/more L3/more ST performance.

I guarantee it   - one more fairly incremental gen at another 50 percent price hike to take advantage of the demand situation after crypto and ai bubbles and anchor those prices  - followed by one last gen at the price of a small car to entice everyone to get their much cheaper streaming packages   And that is it.  If you want access to the content the only way to play it will be to rent  They get to keep charging you indefinitely ( while increasing prices every year) and they will make out like bandits as corrupt neoliberal governments will be happy to subsidise their water, electricity and probably a big part of their manufacturing costs.

We must not forget that Zen 4 and Zen 5 data center products are on a very similar Node as well (except for Zen5c that is), and that AMD might tighten up its Server CPUs together with its Instinct lineup roadmap.  There are tons of variables at play, but I think its far from unrealistic.",Neutral
AMD,"I can't speak for everyone but for me it would be a complete waste of money and time to have specialised AI hardware on a CPU.

AMD,Yeap MS is bringing it to Xbox Ally.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, but the current CPUs already do that, so if they are adding stuff, odds are indeed it's INT4 or FP8 or whatever.",Neutral

AMD,I would agree but everything AI related is a cloud based  subscription (which is the money maker) these days and I wonder how someone would these tiny NPUs to do anything reasonably productive. Hopefully we will see something soon.,Neutral
AMD,"I'm still very dubious how much practical use it will be.  Like, there's only a smallish window of potential use cases where an NPU on the CPU makes sense rather than using a GPU for local AI stuff.

AMD,To be honest I'm actually quite surprised Nvidia hasn't just completely discontinue their consumer gamer lines entirely  Their margins on the b2b server cards are actually mind boggling.,Negative
AMD,"There's a performance benefit to keeping everything else away from the CCD occupied by the game. There aren't a whole lot of people remaining who close everything else anymore when starting a game, and starting from (late?) Windows 10, it's even hard to get rid of a lot of unnecessary background tasks.  It's a bit hard to judge objectively though, because Windows doesn't have containers necessary for proper testing, and Linux is already often faster even without scheduling changes, so it's not feasible to compare the two platforms. A Linux test with one CCD disabled, then both enabled but the game constrained to one CCD could be interesting, but then Linux on its own isn't heavy in the background, so the test would be greatly affected by the choice of extra programs running, where heavy hitters like Discord would start favoring the 2 CCD setup significantly.  I'm not out of touch with more budget conscious people, but if it wasn't obvious, I wanted to point out that even the people who typically spend a lot more of minimal or only perceived benefit go with a single CCD this time, because on their setup (typical Windows gaming), 2 CCDs actually result in worse performance.  It's on software even to the point of Intel attempting to help the industry with best practices: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/optimizing-threading-for-gaming-performance.html (although this one gets more specific to their architecture, even if it still mentions concurrency limitations).  We are talking about the same scaling issue. A specific workload may scale reasonably up to 6 cores (and even that's 1-2 cores for more specialized work), a lot of code still just looks for the number of hardware threads, and creates the same number of software threads to be used in a thread pool specific to a layer, so in total the whole program will typically have more than 2-3x software threads than hardware threads available. This way you can even end up with more cores resulting in worse performance, even though they could be used to tend to the excessive number of software threads with less preemption, and therefore higher performance.",Neutral
AMD,"for typical consumers there's no need for 24/32 cores. Like, obviously if you don't need multicore performance then you don't need many cores. The ""excess"" is only in the minds of people who bought the wrong thing.",Negative
AMD,"The reason why you wouldn't want to go past 10. Is the penalty to the ring, which means you just start trading away performance in latency sensitive tasks for more MT. A pure 10-p core Raptor lake for example, would have better ring latency than a 14900K.     10 is the target where you get as much MT as is reasonable. While still reducing the ring size and improving performance over the 8+16 designs for latency sensitive tasks.",Neutral
AMD,"I get this, but that's what I'm saying - what kind of AI workloads will be useful for people purely on localized, somewhat weak-ish CPU acceleration?  It seems like most of what people like AI for still requires a decent amount of processing power.  Maybe the argument is, ""Well we've got to start somewhere and someday that CPU AI hardware will be good enough"", but I'm not convinced by that either, unless we want CPU's to grow hugely in size, at which point you'd just be better off attaching a dedicated iGPU or chiplet GPU to the package.

But from a consumer standpoint the question is still what will people use the MT for. My point is mainly that a maxed out single P-core ring is the ""sweet spot"" for consumer workloads in cost and silicon usage. And has the best tradeoff between ST/MT still to this day.

AMD,"Okay, good to know. What is your budget?",Neutral
AMD,"your future has only 2 years?...  i just won't care much. i'd buy whatever the latest gen and after several years if one day i feel my pc start to struggle and fail to serve my purposes i'll build a new one. i never ""upgrade"". i don't like for example pairing a cpu of year 2028 with a gpu of year 2024 and a ssd of year 2020",Negative
AMD,as it is right now i could only buy the 16GB DDR5 which i think quite small -- my current system took over 20GB of ram under load,Neutral
AMD,Thanks for the info! i'll look into it.   my desktop already has a lan cable connected to it so i don't really need wireless haha and i use a bt dongle with a usb hub extension so it's near my sofa. i don't really trust the onboard bt  as i can't extend the range easily,Positive
AMD,"the budget is quite flexible, i just want something that does not bottleneck my 9070xt. i have spare pc with aging 3770 + 6600XT AND an Nvidia 5060 which i'm not sure what to with -.-'. upgrading 10400f seems to unlock it so i can use it with either 6600xt or 5060.  Previously i choose intel because of hackintosh support, now with apple silicon out and seeing how good AM4 is for gaming i'm quite regretting that decision -.-'",Neutral
AMD,Then tell me which platform is the most future proof,Neutral
AMD,What are you using it for? Gaming or do you do art or video editing?,Neutral
AMD,"If I were you, I'd sell your spare parts, keep the 9070XT and use the money for upgrading your PC. Here's the [list](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/cB9GWc)",Neutral
AMD,What PSU do you use?,Neutral
AMD,there's no such thing as future proof  a lot can happen. we can't predict the future  and i simply don't care because i never upgrade. i always build new pcs,Negative
AMD,But you're no OP so your opinion is irrelevant,Negative
AMD,"op didn't mention future proof. it's your concern maybe, not necessarily his",Neutral
AMD,"The Intel build is two generations old, the AMD build is current gen.  You'd have to be insane to go for the Intel option.",Neutral
AMD,amd,Neutral
AMD,Amd all the way,Positive
AMD,"Unless the Intel build is somehow like 40% cheaper due to some crazy sale or something, AMD is the option. It's significantly newer stuff.",Neutral
AMD,OMG.  I just built an Am5 9000 series for not much money.  It's so good. Don't even bother with Intel.,Positive
AMD,"Interesting, Build 1 should be significantly cheaper due to DDR4 vs DDR5. Same price, AM5 all day here.",Positive
AMD,AM5 platform of course.. I'd think the Intel setup would be much cheaper because of what it is,Neutral
AMD,"AMD.  AM5 will support at CPUs to at least Zen 6.  That platform has a long life.  If you go with Intel, no upgrade path to future CPUs - you’re stuck with 14th gen as the only upgrade path.  I made the mistake of building my last rig using Intel, thinking I can always upgrade to the best 11th gen but new CPUs in 12th, 13th, 14th gen are even cheaper than equivalent 11th gen retail with updated features and the used market are charging near retail for old tech.",Neutral
AMD,AMD build but swap out the ASRock motherboard. I’ve read that they cause issues with Ryzen CPUs,Negative
AMD,"Second build because it gets you on AM5, both have shit GPUs.",Negative
AMD,If they are the same price AMD platform for sure.,Neutral
AMD,"If you can, AMD because it's a newer system and will upgrade better. The next generation of AMD processors will likely be a significant leap above current (30-40% after IPC, boost and other optimizations) and will hopefully be a drop in replacement. Buy once so you don't have to buy again.",Positive
AMD,Amd for this particular scenario.,Neutral
AMD,"The 13600 is a fine cpu but at equal price, the 9600X is the better value.   I would expect there to be a minimum $125 or so difference (intel costing less) due to DDR4. You are being overcharged somewhere.   Also, stay away from Asrock AM5 boards. There is something strange going on which probably doesn't effect the 9600x but you can never be sure.",Neutral
AMD,AMD,Neutral
AMD,If this is for gaming go with 7800X3D or 9800X3D CPU.,Neutral
AMD,The AMD one is fine but I would change that GPU for one from Nvidia,Positive
AMD,"Yeah but cooler, mobo, and cpu are more expensive so it kind of evens out.",Neutral
AMD,"I have heard too, but I'm pretty sure that is with the X3D COUs.  Also I plan to get the build in a month or two, and I'm hoping by that time that the issue is fixed.",Neutral
AMD,Planning to upgrade as soon as I can from that gpu.,Positive
AMD,Are you 13yo?,Neutral
AMD,"As far as I can tell, this is a rumor based on a few anecdotes anyway. Nobody has been able to recreate the issue in a controlled environment.",Negative
AMD,"A month or two.. are you *certain* prices won't change, that you'll still be able to get the systems as configured? I would be very surprised, even astonished if that was the case.",Neutral
AMD,If you already have the GPU roll with it until it's not enough. If you're buying that GPU as a holdover just don't. Get at least like a 9060xt 16gb.,Neutral
AMD,You aren't actually replacing a GPU.  You are installing one into a system that doesn't have a GPU.,Neutral
AMD,The 5600GT is a CPU. The RTX 3060 is a GPU.  What exactly are you trying to do?  You can link photos from a hosting site like imgur.,Neutral
AMD,"I'm aware but looking at my specs there is no graphics card listed anywhere, all it says is AMD Ryzen 5600gt with Radeon Graphics. And looking inside my PC the areas where you plug into the graphics card are directly connected to the motherboard rather than a graphics card",Neutral
AMD,"The 5600GT has integrated graphics.  All you need to do is install the new GPU, connect your monitor to it, then install the Nvidia drivers.",Neutral
AMD,"The CPU has a shitty little GPU inside of it. If you want a GPU, you need to make sure your PSU can power it properly.",Neutral
AMD,That's good to know but the monitor connection thing connects directly into the motherboard. Is that gonna be an issue?,Neutral
AMD,> monitor connection thing  The video port? Like HDMI or Displayport?   You'll use the ports on the RTX 3060 instead.,Neutral
AMD,"Once you install your new GPU, you'll want to use the monitor connection ports on the GPU, not the motherboard's.",Neutral
AMD,"Plug your display cable into the GPU once installed, then download drivers from nvidia's website.",Neutral
AMD,Pair it with a 6650XT.,Neutral
AMD,9060 XT?,Neutral
AMD,What resolution do you run,Neutral
AMD,What games do you play?,Neutral
AMD,"I believe the 5600G limits you to PCIe3.0 x8 for your GPU. This will negatively affect some of the more powerful GPUs. If you get a discrete card, you should consider swapping out your 5600G with a 5600X if you can find a used one cheaply.",Neutral
AMD,any bigger and the system bottlenecks ?,Neutral
AMD,i just saw this card and it has bad reviews  about not worth the money for the performace ! thats why i'm hesitant,Negative
AMD,is this the best combo or can i go bigger ?,Positive
AMD,why not the 7700 xt ?,Neutral
AMD,i'm only asking cause i'm curious dont like think i'm playing smart,Neutral
AMD,because my monitor doesn't go higher i'm used to it i just want performance,Neutral
AMD,look only play 1080,Neutral
AMD,look because i dont have a graphics card i dont play many games so thats why i'm asking whats the beefyest combo because it allows me to have choices,Negative
AMD,i used to play pubg cs  league  rinbow six,Neutral
AMD,"I mean you can throw in a 5090 if you want, depends what you do with it",Neutral
AMD,"You can always go bigger, especially if you play on high resolution or high settings.  There's just diminishing returns till you upgrade the CPU as well.",Positive
AMD,They’re more expensive and have less vram,Negative
AMD,"Get a 2K monitor with above 120Hz and then with the rest buy the 6750xt or 7700xt or a second hand 3080 or something about that range. I have similar specs but intel and have a second hand 6900xt.  If you want to stay at 1080, then get just the card. But limit the fps to like 160-200.",Neutral
AMD,For 1080p a 9060XT should be sufficient and anything better than that will be bottlenecked by your 5600G,Positive
AMD,9060xt will be amazing for you,Positive
AMD,"What do you want to play, I saw someone else say it, but you could go for a 9060xt or even push to a 9070/5070, cause in some cases you will be CPU bottleneck and in some other not",Neutral
AMD,"Oops, I saw this comment second, then I'd say go for a 9060xt cause these games a relatively more CPU bound than GPU, you can spend excess money on a CPU",Neutral
AMD,"thanks for the advice ! and from what i saw the 9060XT  is better value for money for me and they are very close with 7700 XT performance wise , also the thing that bothered me is i was about to purchase the 7700 xt last year and its price went up at least 70 euros",Positive
AMD,Get the 16GB variant!,Neutral
AMD,The recommended specs you listed are in a higher tier than what your are buying.  No one is going to know what's needed for your specific software.  Maybe consider the 5070 ti as it has 16 GB of vram (same as the 5080).,Neutral
AMD,would a 9070 or 9070xt work?  currently those are in the same price range range as 5070 and way better.,Positive
AMD,"Ram is so expensive right now.  [https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/r2MYC8](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/r2MYC8)  A 5070 TI is $1000 on pcpartpicker, but if you can one for $800. That's great!  For non gaming I am not opposed to intel, but the 14900k costs so much it outweighs the cost of ddr5.",Neutral
AMD,"I am very well aware of that, as mentioned, the budget is around 1200 dollars, and the 5070ti is around 800 dollars. Again, I'm very well aware that only a few people know the specific software, yet I assumed most CAD software has similar requirements. Thanks for the comment.",Neutral
AMD,"It certainly would, but I've seen several posts about their problems and now I'm afraid I'll experience similar issues. Also it's at least $50 more expensive than 5070 and I don't know if I want to spend more for a riskier choice.",Negative
AMD,he said he can’t afford a 5070ti.  i swear half of reddit is nvidia bots.,Neutral
AMD,"being very honest i don’t understand the posts about problems. nvidia drivers really sucked until recently. i had a 9070 steel legend since june and it worked great, except when i was playing around tweaking it.  also by that logic i think the 9060 is not something you want.  its made by amd too.  just my 2 cents.",Negative
AMD,"And you are suggesting amd for 3D modeling? Your more of an npc then me not using context clues to decipher a redditor I'm trying to help out. The extra vram would be for insanely large models, that would probably never be used. Also if you actually did some research CAD models are built on CUDA, and leverage CUDA cores. AMD would be fine on a budget if you were selecting the 9060XT or for gaming. Although the website does say it doesn't matter between NVIDIA and AMD gpu, I would stick with NVIDIA.",Neutral
AMD,"I assume you're referring to overclocking it by tweaking it. It's been nearly 10 years since I've used an AMD GPU, so I don't have relevant first-hand experience with their cards. The thing that frightened me most was the socket melting, not driver issues. Did you have any overheating issues? Then, were you able to fix the problems you had with the drivers?",Negative
AMD,but he has a budget.  why not stay in that?  why would you tell someone to blow their budget.  makes no sense and isn’t helpful.,Negative
AMD,and honestly if you really want to be pedantic and recommend the best based in ques then you would recommend a professional card.  not a gaming card.,Negative
AMD,"yeah i don’t have issues with socket melting. i was tweaking but its been 15 years since  i did that ao im out of practice.  i do a lot of unplugging my 9070 as iv been tweaking and just upgraded to a 4 terabyte ssd.  i think if it was a bigger issue you’d hear more than just some people on reddit.  like with 5090 or 4090.  personally. its been a great card.   i will say Nvidia drivers were a shit show in the beginning but seem to be much better now.  i do feel reddit is Nvidia biased.  all i hear about is how great they are and much better than amd, but i don’t find it the case.  my only concern is do you need cuda anything?  you may then need to go with Nvidia.  i hope by next year that changes.    i was gonna go 5080 originally, but couldn’t stomach paying 1200 for that card when it came out.  im glad i didn’t go with an asrock motherboard though. lol",Neutral
AMD,I misunderstood and thought he said he was getting a 5070 TI for only $100 more than a 5070. So I said hey! Go with the 5070 TI for only a relatively small price increase!,Neutral
AMD,"Cause there is not professional card under $1200? Besides maybe the RTX 4000, and other obscure things that will get beat by a 5070 (TI) for all applications.",Neutral
AMD,"With a quick web search and ChatGPT, I've seen that most CAD softwares are firstly optimized for Nvidia and works best with cuda but honestly I'm not sure if there's drastic difference in performance because of cuda.",Neutral
AMD,"when are you buying?  i can ask at work tomorrow.  we just built a lab with autocad and i would gladly ask the opinions of people who work on this daily, if you like.    we also through a couple of mach in there for AI with ada 4500 graphics.    they do know their stuff",Neutral
AMD,I’d really appreciate it. I can wait for your colleagues’ feedback. Thanks so much!,Positive
AMD,will report back tomorrow!,Neutral
AMD,"It's not starving, you get plenty of fresh air in with those intakes. Exhausts are overrated in general. Everything you may add will bring more noise, keep it as it is imo as long as you have decent temps.",Neutral
AMD,"I upgraded from 5600g to 5700X3D and noticed a large difference in overall smoothness.  Beyond being pcie3, 5600g also only has 16mb of l3 cache which is suboptimal.  In current markets, I'd usually recommend a 5700X/5800X(T) as best gaming CPU for AM4 in terms of value and long-lasting on the platform",Positive
AMD,"If you can afford an x3d chip, go for it. Otherwise? Bang for buck, the 5800 XT is the best cpu upgrade you can make is your on am4 of your on a tighter budget, as you can get it brand new for as little as $138.",Positive
AMD,"Yes, but moreso because you want the extra L3 cache - 16MB of L3 on the G vs the 32MB L3 on the T.    The extra L3 cache is what makes the x3D chips so magical after all.   AM4 G series CPU's lost a lot of L3 cache in the die to make space for the iGPU.  PCIe 3.0 -> 4.0 is just a nice bonus.",Positive
AMD,They are effectively the same pcu performance-wise from what I have read. It probably only makes sense to put money into that pc if you can get an X3D chip if you are coming from a 5600g.  But I think they have jumped in price.,Neutral
AMD,"This is kind of ""it depends"".  Here's a YT vid comparing that card at PCIe 3 vs 4 so see what you think: https://youtu.be/0f7NIeNEV78?si=wfkcRFx3ipaeTBBY",Neutral
AMD,"This is the advice I've also been giving with the high price of memory lately, and AM4 X3D being EOL. It's either this or switch to LGA1700 which still allows you to use existing DDR4.",Neutral
AMD,"it's kinda bad for budget gaming how low end cards nowadays use only 8x PCIe lanes so you're forced to get higher end mobo to get full performance while you can slap even something like 4090 on PCie 3.0 and lose only like 2% of performance, i wish they still make them 16x",Negative
AMD,"And yes i know the 5800xt isn't as good as the 5700x3d or the 5800x3d but price point was not there. I got the 5800xt for $180 and the 5700x3d was double the price or more.  And yes I could possibly have upgraded to AM5 for better performance. But the MOBO, DDR5 RAM, and Ryzen 9800x3d was above what I was wanting to spend.",Negative
AMD,Did you try this:  https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/enbf3b/no_audio_from_system_after_replacing_cpu/le4l7id/,Neutral
AMD,Yes. I found that one last night and tried it multiple times. I have plugged my speakers into the front and back and some headphones in the front. Windows 11 doesn't even recognize them.  I do get audio through my monitor 3.5 mm headphone port.,Neutral
AMD,"The monitor should be a different device, since it is using the HDMI audio interface. I know realtek often likes to bundle all the 3.5mm jacks into a single device called ""Realktek HD speakers"" or something instead of separate devices. If you have something like that try selecting it as the default device?",Neutral
AMD,I downloaded and installed realtek drivers and I cannot find evidence of them anywhere in device manager. My default device options are only AMD audio and the virtual BS ones through steam.,Negative
AMD,"The AMD audio devices should be from the GPU, which means you windows doesn't recognize the mobo audio. Do you have realtek audio console (control?) installed?",Neutral
AMD,Yes but when I open it it says it doesn't support my machine.,Neutral
AMD,Came home today after work and wouldn't you know it. Damn thing is suddenly working. Speakers showing up as a high definition audio device like they used to.   I was trying to futz with the settings and it was freezing my settings bar.   Restarted my computer and it's gone again.,Negative
AMD,Everything looks great. There isn’t much more price-to-performance you can add to your build.,Positive
AMD,Yep the PSU they could've gone MSI mag A750GL or the Montech century II 850w gold,Neutral
AMD,"Good starter pc, but you really do need a dedicated GPU. a 1080 or 1080ti would be a really good budget option for you, if you can afford it.",Positive
AMD,"the GPU really depends on what you are willing to spend on it, because there are ""best"" options at different price points. And that will affect what you want to run on it, brand new games with cutting edge graphics, Minecraft with mods, Runescape, etc. if you can I'd look for a Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB under $400 if u can, otherwise GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB around $430. If u need cheaper then something like a 4060 or 5060, if u can go even more then the 4070 super is a good option.",Neutral
AMD,"Wow, that was fast! I did notice it had no gpu so I probably had to buy one, but I forgot to mention that lmao, I'll check those ones out though, thanks a lot",Positive
AMD,"Sorry, I just checked and I don't seem to find the GPUs you're mentioning anywhere near me, they're always out of stock and they recommend me a 3070 or something, got any other ones? they can be a bit more expensive if it's worth it",Negative
AMD,"The g after the 5300 indicates it has integrated graphics on the AM4.  It'll struggle a bit on Blade & Sorcery, probably will get around 40-45 fps.  That might not be the best experience for you.",Negative
AMD,"sorry for being late after being early, but yeah anything in the 30 series is good, 3070 is really good albeit a bit overkill for you. I saw in another comment that you have a 3050 selected, and its good for what you need.",Positive
AMD,"Processor: Ryzen 5 5500     Graphics Card: RTX 3050 6GB     Motherboard: A520 DDR4     RAM: 1x16GB 3200MHz     SSD: 500GB     Power Supply: 500W Bronze Plus     Operating System: Windows 11     Connectivity: Ethernet  Gotchu, what about this? it's not THAT much more expensive",Neutral
AMD,"lol no problem, thanks a lot :D",Positive
AMD,"It's a modest system, but I'd get it over the 5300g.  From what I can tell it should get about 70 fps which is enough for most people to feel like it's smooth.",Negative
AMD,"anything over 60 fps is good, it's mostly cause I wanna play games cause I'm on a pc that's monitored by my dad (despite being 18) so I don't care that much if it's an AMAZING pc, it's good enough it seems",Positive
AMD,It's actually enough to play most games.  It has some upgrade potential.  Like adding a second stick of memory and going from a 5500 to a 5600 would help.,Positive
AMD,"Thanks a lot for the tips, I really appreciate them",Positive
AMD,That's a very good bundle. Note that you will need new DDR5 RAM and that has gotten pretty expensive recently.,Positive
AMD,"for $100 more id get the 9800x3d honestly.   but yeah MC has the best bundles. You can also price match if you find anything cheaper on amazon, Newegg etc.. They price match anything long as its not by third party or refurbished.",Positive
AMD,"Oh yeah, I didn't even think about that since on my current B550 they are probably DD4.....",Neutral
AMD,Is there a night and day difference between the two when it comes to gaming?  I was looking around for bundles because if i have to upgrade - i definitely need a new motherboard as well.  Would a 80+ Gold 650W be sufficient to run with a 3080 gpu?,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, you definitely have DDR4 now.",Neutral
AMD,It's pretty much the same just fixed alot of the issues 7800x3d had. 9800x3d does have the better performance thoe. Just don't get a asrock board you should be fine. The tuff is pretty decent imo. Don't get asus prime boards ...straight garbage.  9800x3d Is pretty top tier when comings to gaming.  650w. Yeah long as you're not overclocking or running crazy amount of fans. 3080 draws roughly 320W Cpu and mobo probably around 220 that's with the ram.  You'll be right at the edge but it's doable.  Maybe lookup undervolting your gpu and ryzen for better power consumption while keeping the performance.,Positive
AMD,"Something like 10% uplift, stick with the 7800 and get 32gb of ram you can save the 100 and buy a 10050x3d before you upgrade your board again",Neutral
AMD,Awesome thanks for the tips.  Only fans i would considering installing would be some air cooling fans for the cpu to keep it cool that a friend of mine had reccommended.,Positive
AMD,I was thinking of doing that too actually.  On newegg - theres a 30$ off 414$ and comes with AIO 85$ value liquid cooler black friday deal still going off the CPU and if i were to choose a 110$ Gigabyte B650  - it comes with two 8gb Team Group ram sticks but then i would have to get another 16gb after doing that. I don't think those are good anyway probably better off maybe buying 2 16gb with the microcenter deal.,Neutral
AMD,That’s dope it comes with an AIO too. Yeah I’m waiting until AM6 unless my i9 blows up. Then it will force my hand but with the 7800 and 9800 being soooo close and the ram has atleast doubled will help overall price shock. 7800x3d is goated,Positive
AMD,Torn between both routes and when free stuff is given from newegg it usually gets me to purchase. Who doesn't like free stuff? But the reviews are mixed on this AIO so gotta think on it. Also not sure if i should wait until cyber monday for some hopeful deals lol,Neutral
AMD,very true maybe retailers take alittle more off since I dont feel it was great black friday deals.,Negative
AMD,"That is actually a well balanced and good build. And if you can get it for $2300 now, the buy. RAM and SSD prices are going up fast, and GPUs will also go up in price.   It's a similar build to what I have myself.   Ryzen 7 9800x3d  RX 9070XT  32 GB Corsair CL36 6000 MT/s RAM 2x KC3000 2TB SSDs Corsair RM850x psu Arctic Liquid Freezer ii 240 ASUS TUF B650 Plus WiFi motherboard  Dutzo C730 TG case, it's a generic case, I want to switch it so I can fit a 360 radiator.   I upgraded my CPU yesterday, but had the same system with a Ryzen 5 7600x, and it have performed very well with that CPU for over 2 years, but with the 9800x3d on Black Friday sale, i had to upgrade when I could.",Positive
AMD,"These parts are pretty good. I'm not an expert on AIO coolers, air coolers can do fine for the power consumption level of a 9800X3D.  For PSUs you can check quality [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1akCHL7Vhzk_EhrpIGkz8zTEvYfLDcaSpZRB6Xt6JWkc/htmlview?gid=931697732&pru=AAABmv3R8B8*vrdvHFxaY4oXqTs0te2Zag#gid=931697732) by looking at the tiers, you want a B or higher.  As for RAM 6000 is good, just wanted to add that if there are major price differences between CL levels, don't worry about it too much. Any CL30 to 36 or even 38 will work fine with a 9800X3D CPU.  Maybe if you link the stores you plan to buy from I can check if there are any better deals motherboard/SSD wise.",Positive
AMD,"Pretty even build, balanced. I don't know why you are opting for an AIO, but that is personal. I also got one (not Deepcool), but later went back to a tower cooler that was not out yet when I got the AIO, when it started to act weirdly and I have been very happy since. It feels a tad expensive, but RAM prices are high and that ups the price quite a bit and there is nothing to do about that at the moment either.",Neutral
AMD,Pretty solid build.  Just A b850 motherboard will be better suited with 9800xd. Though b650 what you choose is good.  A dual tower cpu cooler is enough for 9800x3d. Though its personal choice for an 360mm aio.,Positive
AMD,Looks good,Positive
AMD,AMD themselves recommend liquid cooling for their X3D CPUs. Most here recommend air cooling towers but I think AIOs are cool. Just make sure you choose one that's reviewed.,Positive
AMD,"Hey, thanks a lot for the recommendations! Here you can observe the prices for PC parts in Ukraine for different retailers - https://hotline.ua/. Keep in mind, the prices are shown in UAH.",Positive
AMD,That psu is A- tier. Pretty solid.,Positive
AMD,"Dosnt change anything really, the b650 can suport it fine",Neutral
AMD,"Thanks for the recommendations. By the way, which tower CPU coolers would be a good alternative to my current water cooler?",Positive
AMD,"Unavailable atm, will have a look later if I remember.",Neutral
AMD,Yeah it’s more about giving them the tools to find best price for quality.,Positive

AMD,">With the new system there is notable lag switching to the browser and each time I click on an email it will take a few seconds for it to respond.  If that's your only issue then the issue might just be that you are now playing in fullscreen for some reason, and should switch back to borderless windowed.",Negative
AMD,Have your task manager open and see if something takes a lot of ressources,Neutral
AMD,"I had that thought, too, but the conditions are the same.",Neutral
AMD,"WRT borderless vs fullscreen - I believe you have fixed it, but I don't understand how.  I knew BF offered, Windowed, Borderless, and Fullscreen.  I never use Windowed.  I never noticed a difference between Fullscreen and Borderless.  I absolutely do now though.  When in Fullscreen the computer works like it should.     Can you explain why it would have such an impact?",Negative
AMD,"I did, but don't remember seeing anything.  I will do another test today and check back in.",Neutral
AMD,I tried it again.  I am using virtually none of the CPU and ram is at 40%.  Lampenpam was on to something though.  As soon as I switched from Borderless to Fullscreen the issues stopped.,Neutral
AMD,"but besides that the fps are higher? If so then it might just be a bug, with the game running in fullscreen despite saying it's not. It could also be some other setting like HDR maybe that causes Windows to switch it's video output for some reason. I'm just guessing here, but if the overall performance is higher then the hardware is probably not the issue",Negative
AMD,"well the fullscreen option is kind of obsolete nowadays, borderless windowed doesn't have a performance impact (unlike a few years ago) but fullscreen requires Windows to weirdly readjust/reload/reset (?) its video output when switching in and from a fullscreen application and that causes this annoying interruption.    So in short, always stick to borderless windowed and enjoy instantly tabbing in and out of games.",Negative
AMD,"That's really weird, i did not know it could affect performance that much ! But it's good to know",Negative
AMD,The fps is no higher only because I have it limited to 60 FPS and 1080P due to my monitor.,Neutral
AMD,well off-topic but with that card you should definitely treat yourself to a better monitor soon and enjoy some higher framerates (and resolution),Positive
AMD,"Yeah, I know.  I feel guilty spending as much as I did on the computer and did not want to tell the wife I needed to spend more on getting a new monitor.  She actually doesn't really care.  Just my guilt.  This monitor is actually capable of 244hz, but my previous card could not handle that.   Can you tell an old man which I would be more likely to notice higher resolution or FPS?",Negative
AMD,"I'd say framerate makes a bigger difference, even playing at around 90fps already feels a lot better than 60. If this monitor already allows for higher framerates, then you should go to your Windows display settings and try changing the framerate output https://youtu.be/DLfPJRZqXjs   as otherwise you will always see 60fps no matter what framerate the game is running at.  If Windows only allows a 60hz option, then you might also need to go to your GPU settings and tell it to actually output at a higher framerate. At least that's the case for nVidia cards.",Neutral

AMD,"Update the bios on your motherboard to take 5000 series (if it doesnt have the correct bios already), pick up a ryzen 5600 used off ebay and grab a 9060xt 16gb gpu. Two parts, drop in replacement, massive, MASSIVE improvements.   Don't listen to the elitists in here talking about if you aren't on am5, your hardware is useless. It couldn't be further from the truth. Theres still plenty of years of good gaming on am4 and with Ram prices in this current market, and you already being on an am4 platform using a 1st Gen chip, going to a 5th Gen chip is a seriously massive improvement.   A ryzen 5600 is going to play any game on the market today. Paired with a 9060xt 16gb, you've got a great little ripper for a little over $400 upgrade cost. Much less than the $1200+ youd have into building a machine worth building over upgrading.",Positive
AMD,i can...  i can see why  I mean... its a pretty old pc parts wise. I'd just rebuild.  But ig uhhhhh gpu / cpu / probably psu (if you do a gpu and cpu upgrade),Neutral
AMD,Upgrade cpu to maybe 5600 or something like that and save more money to upgrade gpu later,Neutral
AMD,"Both the CPU and the graphics card are quite old and slow. If you can afford an RX 9060 XT (16GB model), I would get that first probably, because prices will be going up soon. You will still be CPU bottlenecked in a lot of games, depending on the settings you are using, but there are some great CPU upgrade options too, and you can just upgrade that a few months later, if you can't afford the CPU upgrade at the same time.  A Ryzen 5600 or 5700X would be an excellent CPU upgrade. Many of the cheaper Ryzen CPUs only have 16MB of L3 cache, and will be slower as a result. Unless it's a really good deal, and you can't afford a Ryzen 5600 or 5700X, don't get a Ryzen CPU which only has 16MB of L3 cache when you upgrade. For example, the Ryzen 5500, 5600G, and 5700 (non X) all have 16MB of L3 cache, and perform significantly worse in games as a result.  The Intel B580 is a decent graphics card, and cheaper than the 9060 XT 16GB (and cheaper than the 8GB model as well). However, the B580 has more CPU overhead than the RX 9060 XT, and is more prone to CPU bottlenecking than the 9060 XT. The B580 also requires REBAR support from your CPU (or some other feature?), so I think you would also need a minimum of a Ryzen 3600 (or Ryzen 5500) to work with the B580, and would still suffer from serious CPU bottlenecking in many scenarios even with either of those CPUs. Basically, you should probably get a minimum of a Ryzen 5600 if you're going to go with the B580, and it would still be preferable, if you can afford it, with the 9060 XT 16GB as well.  You can still get some CPU bottlenecking with the B580 even with the 5600, but only in more extreme scenarios, and it would be at a very acceptable level if/when it does happen, especially considering the low price of the 5600 and the B580.  The speed of your RAM will hold back your performance somewhat as well, but now is not the time to upgrade your RAM. Just keep in mind that your CPU performance will be held back a bit if your RAM is slower than 3200 CL16. It might be worth manually tuning or overclocking the RAM, but you would want to make sure it runs stable.  If you start getting occasional crashes, overclocked/ tuned memory is often to blame, even if it happens 6 months later. It's important to remember that a RAM overclock is a likely cause of crashes, so you know to try lowering the speeds or loosening the timings again in case stability issues arise later on.",Neutral
AMD,60 dollars for a Ryzen 5 5600 and the remaining 140 should be enough for something like an RTX 2060 Super. These two upgrades should really help with your FPS in basically every game,Positive
AMD,"more ram , better cpu , better grafix card. all which will need bigger psu.",Positive
AMD,Wowza you need a new cpu…which will require a new motherboard more than likely. Your GPU is also extremely weak for playing most new games. And upgrading all that will of course require a stronger power supply than whatever trash Sky tech put in there.   Ram also needs help but at its current price you would be much better spending money upgrading the other components first.,Negative
AMD,"Damn, I hope you didn't pay much for that. You bought a 2017 CPU and a 2016 GPU in 2020.  If RAM wasn't currently so expensive I'd say torpedo the whole thing and rebuild on AM5 when you have a bit more money, but you need *both* a CPU and a GPU upgrade to get this one going better. If you get lucky you can probably find a Ryzen 5 5600 (any 5600 model except the -G) and an RX 6600 on the secondhand market to fit inside your budget.  Your power supply is worrisome but it'll *work* for these upgrades and you can't fit a PSU upgrade in your budget while buying the other two parts.",Negative
AMD,You definitely can upgrade but I'd rather spend a bit more and build a new pc at that point.,Neutral
AMD,"Ram,cpu,gpu you definitely need to upgrade",Neutral
AMD,Id get a 2700x and a 2070 super at least. I built my pc in 2018 and it was doing everything on ultra except cyberpunk. 4gb of vram wasnt enough when you built the thing.,Neutral
AMD,"Your motherboard (ASRock B450 AC) supports the latest AM4 processors. Update its BIOS to the latest via the link below:  https://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/B450Mac/index.asp  Then upgrade the CPU to Ryzen 5600 (5700X if you do other stuff like video editing and video rendering).   And upgrade the GPU to something like AMD RX 9060XT 16GB. You will get a tremendous boost in gaming and those upgrades will bring your rig into the modern world. In fact, it will probably be more powerful than that Steam Machine scheduled to be released next year.",Positive
AMD,"That's a good point to mention the bios upgrade. You need to make sure that your motherboard does have a bios update available which adds support for Zen 3 CPUs.   Also, you shouldn't update the bios until AFTER you actually have a new Ryzen 5600 or 5700X ready to install into the system, because it will break compatibility with the old CPU (but you probably need to perform the bios update while the old CPU is still installed in the motherboard).",Positive
AMD,"Some people here love to turn a $400 problem into a $800+ problem.  I agree there are very few games that the 5600 won't play at an enjoyable level.  Coming from a 1600, even a used 3600 or 5500 would be a significant step up.  And a minimum it should at least get them to a time where RAM prices are improved.",Negative
AMD,"CPU prices are going to stay flat or continue to go down. Graphics card prices are about to go up. I would upgrade the graphics card first. Any modern GPU will be significantly bottlenecked by the Ryzen 1600, but a lot of games will still run relatively well, and way better with a more powerful graphics card.   The B580 is an exception to this. It will be virtually unusable with a Ryzen 1600 because the Ryzen 1600 doesn't support REBAR... or some other feature that the B580 needs to work properly. You need a minimum of a Zen 2 CPU, and preferably a Ryzen 5600, to pair with a B580.",Negative

AMD,"9060xt and ryzen 5600 would be so much of an improvement for OP, that I think he'd be astonished. Will run on their existing psu and motherboard (with updated bios). Its what makes most sense for them imo given the current climate. Prices are crazy, hes already on am4, so spending a little over $400 to upgrade to a 9060xt 16gb and ryzen 5 5600 would be huge for them and take them all of 25 mins to put in.",Positive
AMD,"It's one of those classic scam pre builds probably, where they make it look flashy with RGB and make the names of parts sound good to less knowledgeable people like ""ryzen 5 CPU"", and put a lot of stuff in the description about it being able to play games at really high fps except the games are super easy to run and probably tested on 720p low settings. They're especially common on ebay",Negative
AMD,"They don't need to do a full rebuild. A Ryzen 5600 or 5700X with a B580 or RX 9060 XT 16GB would be a massive upgrade, and far cheaper than upgrading to current gen motherboard, CPU, and RAM.  The current DDR5 memory pricing makes upgrading to a modern platform a lot more expensive now than it was even a month ago.",Neutral
AMD,Have you not heard about the skyrocketing DDR5 RAM prices?,Neutral
AMD,"Now is not a good time to upgrade RAM.   There are a small number of games which may perform a lot better with more than 16GB of system RAM, but very few games need this yet. Also, if your videocard has more than 8GB of RAM, 16GB of system RAM is somewhat less likely to be an issue.   Tuning or overclocking the RAM they already have might be worth doing though.",Negative
AMD,"I would say probably a Ryzen 3600 at minimum. I wouldn't consider anything less than that unless it's really cheap and they're on a super tight budget.  A 2070 Super would certainly be a big upgrade, but again, it would need to be cheap to be worth getting, and I would suggest probably going for an Intel B580, RTX 3060, or RX 6700 XT, at minimum.  Unless someone is enthusiastic about trying to find a good deal on the used market, I would probably steer them more toward the 16GB RX 9060 XT, or the B580, depending on which one fits their budget better.   The trouble with the B580 is that it will also suffer worse bottlenecking than the 9060 XT with a Ryzen 3600 or 5500, so it would be a lot better to get a Ryzen 5600 (minimum) to pair with a B580.",Neutral
AMD,Thanks for the input. This seems to be the consensus as far as upgrades go. Will the computer still run fine if i were to replace the gpu now and the cpu later? And would a 8gb 9060xt suffice if I’m playing on 1080 144hz monitor?,Positive
AMD,"Precisely why I worded it ""update your bios TO TAKE 5000 series chips"". Updates it once, and is done with it for more than likely the remainder of its life span. OP just needs to pay attention that if its on an old bios that he follows the steps it gives, as sometimes you have yo update to another version in between before jumping straight to the latest. Id be willing to bet, having built the rig when he did, that the bios on it currently already is 5000 ready, but they should definitely make sure.  Honestly, ive been building and selling budget rigs for the last going on 8 years (easily over 70 computers) and can confidently say, having bought some old, cheap boards off of Ebay, unless its a Chinese knock off board, they almost always have bios support up to ryzen 5000 series, especially the B450 and B550's. Hell, even the older b350 boards ive used ive updated bios to take ryzen 5500's.",Neutral
AMD,"His RAM is probably a little on the slow side, and will hold back the performance of the CPU somewhat, but you're right. It would be a massive performance uplift.   Manual memory tuning might be worth it, IF he can get a stable overclock. Just just tightening the timings a little can sometimes make a big difference.",Neutral
AMD,yeah,Neutral
AMD,"Your probably right on the 3600, but idk, the only cpu bottleneck i ever had with a 2700x was minecraft with shaders and cybercuck 2077 both underutilized my 2070s.  Now ill still stand by the 2070 super, you cant get them like $150 used (i payed like $400-500 for a used fb marketplace one during the gpupocolypse.) Idk about the intel card so i cant say, but i feel like a $150 2070s or $200 1080ti or a $250 2080ti with some new paste would all be very good contenders unless OP absolutely needs 4k. I feel like 16gb cards are still a bit overkill unless you are absolutely bleeding edge. But maybe im just a fud.  Also idk what rebar is but that just sounds like an L for the intel card. I want an intel card myself too, so dont think im being a hater or anything 🙏",Negative
AMD,"Yes, it's fine the replace the GPU first. The old Ryzen 1600 will hold it back significantly but this simply means that you'll probably only get a sold 60fps when you should be getting 100fps with a modern CPU.   A 8GB VRAM video card is fine for now but it might become a limiting factor in the future. If it's only a few dollars more, I'd rather get the 16GB version.   Also, note that memory prices recently shot through-the-roof due to shortages and A.I. demands so get your GPU as soon as possible before prices increases. If you don't get the 16GB version now, you might not be able to afford it in the near future. Both AMD and NVIDIA indicated big price rises are incoming next year.",Neutral
AMD,"It can smooth out the frame times, but outside of that its pretty neglible in gaming. 3000-3200mhz is the sweet spot for am4 ryzen based chips. As long as hes in dual channel hes fine. Gamers nexus did a video comparing performance from 2400, 2666, 3000, 3200, and 3600 memory and the difference is neglible in game. As he put it, ""within margin of error"".   The difference between 2400 and 3600 smoothed out the frame times and added s couple fps, but the difference between 2666 to 3000, or 3000 to 3200 is neglible. Absolutely NOT worth spending the absurd prices for a 2fps bump (generously). If ram prices were normal, then sure, why not throw $55 at a silicon power 32gb 3600mhz cl16 kit. But with Ram prices today, that $55 kit is now $180, which is ABSOLUTELY NOT worth it.",Positive
AMD,"Budget is kind of important to know.   Anyway, 5090!",Neutral
AMD,"In terms of budget - I was hoping to keep this “gift” under $2,500 in total. But I also don’t want to make upgrades that won’t carry me through the whole build. I hope that makes sense.   I’m seeing a lot in my searches that I need to make sure the motherboards PCIe slot works for the graphics card I’m looking to buy. That is what I don’t know how to identify when buying online.   I see various model numbers mentioned - how do I know if they will fit in the slots? Is there a term or something I can be taught to look for so I know what I’m compatible with?  I didn’t add a budget at first because I see some very expensive graphic cards, but if a great card is going be expensive, but will also require additional ram… then I was looking to learn that chain of progression so I can plan accordingly.   When I look up the card he currently has, it shows it is for 1080p resolution- and I want to bump that up to 4k… or just better.",Neutral
AMD,"Depends on the budget. 9060xt, 9070xt, 5070ti, 5090 I think is the general hierarchy atp. The case looks big enough to fit any of them.  I’d keep an eye out for a deal on a 32gb+ of ram - maybe another 16gb stick if you can find a matching one.",Neutral

Selling the old 16GB kit and buying a full set avoids compatibility headaches. CPU cooler like the Peerless Assassin works well for a 7800X3D if you go that route. I can give tips on RAM pairing, GPU sizing, and which CPU to choose for best performance but I'd recommend talking to an expert: there’s a Discord user called budgetpcdeals who’s super knowledgeable, shares free advice and compatibility tips, and helps find deals for a 1-5$ fee if you need - saved me like 40 bucks on my last build.",Positive
AMD,This makes no sense dude.  You bought an $800 rig and now you want to put $2500 of upgrades into it?  WTF are you talking about?,Negative
AMD,For 4k gaming get at least a 5070ti but if you want high refresh rates at 4k then you’ll need to spend more. 5090 is probably the move. Look for a founders edition for 1999 and use the rest to get a 7800x3D cpu or a 9800x3D cpu.   You’re not likely going to need more than 32gb of ram.    But honestly for $2500 I’d probably build a new computer around a 5080 and play games with him.   Just make sure he has a monitor that can take advantage or it’s all just going to be incredibly smooth 1080p gaming haha,Neutral
AMD,"Better off selling the 16gb kit and buying a complete 32gb kit. It’s recommended not to use 2 ram kits together. Even identical part number kits when paired have a decent chance of ram failures, as there’s no guarantee you’ll get a set made with the same dram modules from the same manufacturer, as brands source them from a few different manufacturers.   TLDR; Ram is sold as a pair, because it’s been vetted and passed qc to run at its advertised speeds together, can’t have the same guarantee for ram from another pack, even if it’s identical part numbers.",Negative
AMD,"A little confused myself?   Honestly tho, since what’s done is done.   I believe  for the current pc it is an am5 board, which means you should be able to throw a 7800x3d in it, as well as any gpu. The only distinction between motherboards and gpu is the pcie speed, and am5 has at least pcie4 which is basically identical to the higher spec pcie5 when it really comes down to it for gaming, so you’re good on getting any gpu you want, it will fit no problem (just make sure the length of the card can fit within the length of the pc case.)  The most substantial upgrade you would be able to do for even less than your quoted budget, is to upgrade the cpu to a 7800x3d, upgrade the gpu to a 5070ti, and grab any 32gb 6000mhz ram kit you can find for cheap.   These components will be a super simple swap, that will almost triple your son’s current performance, which to say you will definitely get decent 4k performance, and will last for at least a few years to come. You can watch YouTube videos on how to swap each component aswell for some tips on how to make it go smoothly.  Oh you’ll also want to grab a new cpu cooler, the peerless assassin on amazon is a great value cooler for the 7800x3d",Neutral

AMD,it is a scam. nothing else.,Negative
AMD,"If people stop buying at these dumb prices theyll come down eventually. Theyve certainly pushed the consumers limits time and time again, at some point it will collapse the sales",Negative
AMD,"They're raising prices because sales of CPUs, motherboards, and other DIY PC components have plummeted in recent months due to DDR5 memory prices surging. This sales drop has forced AMD to lower their forward guidance for their CPU business, and the only short term prayer they have to combat this drop in revenue is to raise prices and push these parts up-segment.  Basically, gaming PCs are, in the near future, moving away from higher volume mass market to lower volume luxury and will be priced accordingly.",Negative
AMD,Is anybody surprised Nope! This was in woodworks,Neutral
AMD,they were already expensive and now they are gonna rise it even more?  I guess I'll stay with my intel motherboard a bit more... at least until AM6.,Negative
AMD,"Maybe hot take or unpopular opinion, but PC parts are still historically cheaper than ever before. I remember my dad bringing home a Pentium 2 that was like $5000.

I guess the pain point is everything else is so expensive that spending even these historically cheap prices still feels too much",Negative

AMD,"Just finished my build a few weeks ago slowly buying parts over the previous month and a half.  I got every single part under MSRP, including the 5080, except for the damn Ram.  But even then I avoided the worst of the price hike.  Paid $240 for 32 gb of 6000 CL30 beginning of November.  Same kit costs $480 now.  Prices are going to be nutty when the Ram spike and subsequent shortage settles and trickles down to GPUs, prebuilts, etc along with whatever tariff bullshit Trump is doing.",Negative
AMD,I bought a computer during pre black week sales. Still haven't got it delivered.  Really hope I get it as it may be an extremely good deal on now compared to just one month ago..,Positive
AMD,"Or maybe they just don't drop price at all and keep it like that forever, just like how Nvidia did GPU.",Neutral
AMD,to be fair anyone who's building a gaming PC and putting up with these ram prices won't bat an eye at an extra 10-15% CPU cost,Negative
AMD,"I don’t think that’s the idea because CPU prices aren’t going to drop back down unless RAM prices do to. Anyone buying a new CPU has to also buy RAM, so CPUs aren’t going to sell much more just because they’re cheaper if RAM prices aren’t the bottleneck.  I think it’s more likely that they recognize that overall sales will go down due to RAM costs, and anyone looking to buy a CPU in the next few years will be less price sensitive since they’re willing to shell out for RAM. I’d imagine they’re doing this then to offset the lower volume.",Neutral
AMD,"It helps compensate for lower sales volume. If you know demand for your product is relatively inelastic you can increase your prices in the face of market headwinds to make greater margin at reduced volume. It does leave you open to being undercut by your competitors, but AMD is so far ahead in CPU right now that they might feel they can take the risk.",Neutral

AMD,"A year ago, I purchased a 32 GB memory upgrade for my PC that cost me $83, that kit cost $300 now.",Negative
AMD,"No clue what you are talking about. GPUs have usually been the most expensive parts.  Why are people even downvoting this? A 7500F system went from 350-400$ to spending close to that ON THE RAM ALONE. So entry level AM5 can cost about $600 right now. People who can't afford this, will just not upgrade, i.e. not buy CPUs. Meaning: Sales go down.  GPUs have no direct relation to ANY other part prices, so I have no clue what they mean with their comment. You can upgrade your GPU as long as your PC has a PCIe slot and a good enough PSU. And even GPUs in full systems are barely affected because a $2k being 10% more expensive due to RAM is much less relevant than a 50% increase on your individual CPU upgrade.",Negative
AMD,"Well, it reduces the amount of buyers. And fewer buyers -> more stock -> lower prices. So it goes up by 10-15% due to AMD and then down due to supply.",Neutral
AMD,"Well, that is what I meant: They raise prices to compensate for the expected losses in sales. Practically speaking, they are making the retailers pay for their losses in sales volume, because CPU pricing is directly related to the RAM pricing.  Sure, that might just be $20-30 out of $600 total for your upgrade, but you'll still see an overall effect on the purchases. For a single person, it might not matter much to spend 20 bucks more, but in terms of the whole market, even small average price increases will show up in sales.  And keep in mind - Intel might be down atm, but they still exists and compete - and they'll potentially release their new architecture next year. So this is not just AMD increasing prices in a vacuum. The Ultra 235 is already contesting with 9700X and 7700X, the Ultra 225 with the 9600X and 7600X.",Neutral
AMD,"AMD isn't actually that far ahead. Non-X3D CPUs are head-to-head with Intel, if not worse in terms of value. That's just something that people aren't really talking about that much.  Intel has flown under the radar since the whole 13th/14th gen disaster, but they are far from dead. Even Apple is apparently going to produce some of their M-chips with Intel's new production process. Of course, it is hard to make any guesses of what this will actually mean for Intel's competition with AMD, but I really don't think it is as clear-cut as many people on this sub assume it is.",Neutral

AMD,"Dafuq. I think this is a luxury in every sense of the word. My 1080 GOAT is running cyberpunk, Hogwarts, horizon, etc. on high quality with enough fps to clutch warzone dubs.  Idk what game needs high specs. Obviously you can get unreal 4k ultra textures out of it with a high end spec, but neeeeed?",Positive
AMD,"You are correct; there are plenty of modern indy and small dev games that are great. These games, however, don't typically require newer hardware (as they are either well-optimized or aren't computationally/graphically intensive). AAA games have been the biggest offendor for microtransaction, unoptimized, and AI slop.",Positive
AMD,This is very much not true if you actually pay attention.   Expedition 33  Arc Raiders  Baaltro   Marvel Rivals,Negative
AMD,You guys are good till am6. Stay the course . Save enough for in the meantime for a 4k monitor cuz that's where all the new hardware shines.,Positive
AMD,"Heck, I have a 5700X and a 9070 XT, and it's glorious. I play MSFS at 4K High/Ultra and the 5700X is still not maxed out at 60% usage.",Positive

AMD,"Well now, just the ram is that much! You probably would have felt more justified now keeping it!",Positive
AMD,Now it’s time to decide whether you buy those same components for 2x literally rn or for 5x next year.,Neutral
AMD,That is a cheap upgrade for a lot of capability.   In 2020 it was about that much to go from a 3570k DDR3 system to 3600 AM4+NVMe. Just under $800 IIRC.,Neutral
AMD,I feel that. Shame though,Negative

AMD,"so, basicly the anime industry model .. just pure focus on the whales",Neutral
AMD,"Just remember the extra cost of the online subscription if you plan to play online. 10$/month for the 5 years or so you might use the console is 600$. Steam games are also usually cheaper. Not to mention greymarket keys etc.    I know cash flow is not the same as money now, but it's worth remembering total cost for those on a budget.",Neutral
AMD,"The 1080TI compares to the 5090, not the 5080 in terms of where in the stack it fits.",Neutral
AMD,"The msrp of the 1080Ti in 2017 was $699.  $699 in 2017 is equivalent in purchasing power to about $923.87 today, an increase of $224.87 over 8 years. The msrp of the 5080 is $999.  Median income has however only increased by 3% since 2017. So relatively speaking GPU prices have increased even more disproportionately.  Also it should be pointed out that nvidia has since shifted the model stack a tier down. The 1080 Ti was the same die as the Titan. The 3080 was on the same die as the 3090. The 80 series was *very much* closer in performance to the halo card.   Now the 5080 is more comparable to what a 1070 was back in 2017 or a 1070 in 2020. Those launched for $379 (1070) and $499 (3070).",Neutral
AMD,²⁰¹⁷699=²⁰²⁵926.20 with inflation. and the cheapest I see on Amazon now is 999.  Sadly not all 5080 are the same.  1500 for Asus tuf 5080.  Asus rog astral are 1700 and 1800 for white.  You are right.,Negative
AMD,"[Here ](https://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large/public/inline-images/inflation_prices_7_full-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp)you got a source. As you can see, besides the flagship performance, pricing isn't actually that bad. And realistically, the flagship is of no real relevance for the typical gamer (and isn't really always comparable because flagship performance is really just what Nvidia choose it to be due to their monopoly on the high-end).  This is offtopic, though. Not even sure why I get downvoted for pointing that out.   GPU pricing is barely affected by other parts because it is the most expensive compent in like 90% of cases. If you buy a $2k build, $100-200 more sucks, but that isn't gonna change much about you having $2k to spend.  CPUs, on the other hand, are directly affected by RAM and mainboard pricing - and if RAM suddenly costs $100-200 more, then your CPU upgrade costs that much more. Especially for budget builds, that is easily 30-50% of the price.",Neutral

AMD,Only Balatro on that list.,Neutral
AMD,"I reckon further than that tbh. CPUs aren't doing anything radically different and games rarely make use of the ones we have, so ya long live 8c/16t  Although with the landscape changing over the next decade with AI bullshit and Nvidia clearly pushing to be lease-first, I worry about stagnation more than anything.",Negative
AMD,Haha for real. Especially if this is the outlook for a couple years.,Positive
AMD,Yeah.. subscriptions for the rest :(,Neutral
AMD,Can't question the money proposition there. I just think it depends on what your use case/needs are. I cancelled my PS subscription because I stopped using my PS5 for online games. All my online play is PC and I almost use my PS5 exclusively for single player and local/couch co-op type games,Neutral
AMD,"Those arguments are so off the mark but always circlejerked in these subreddits lmao  the 80$ a year (which isnt needed for a lot of the most popular online games anyway if that's your angle) also gets you 24-36 games a year added to  your account.  ""on a budget"" that is an excellent deal and you're not factoring in the savings you can get via physical media which is always so lost on PC only people",Neutral
AMD,"I hate the Steam it’s cheaper argument, on PS you can literally get a latest release physically then trade it for another latest release, you can play basically for free, +- few dolars, otherwise yea, paying for online sucks",Negative
AMD,"And then you look at the 1080 which is $808 MSRP with inflation but for only 10-15% performance increase instead of 50% and compare that to the 5070 Ti at $749 MSRP with 30% performance increase (over the respective 70 models). So 50 series is way better value here.  With the 5080 you also compared a release card of the 50 series to a card that released a year after the 10 series came out originally. So 1080 Ti pricing should be closer to the (now delayed) 5080/5070Ti Super, if anything.  You need to look at the overall picture. Don't just pick the data that fits your conclusion. The overall picture is: Not much has changed. Nvidia specifically has some more agency over pricing due to their AI quasi-monopoly, but for gaming, it really isn't that bad atm.",Neutral
AMD,"Thing is 1080ti was on the titan die, so it was a downscaled flagship, part of the reason it's remained relevant for so long.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, there is a difference but it's not nearly as big as I thought. Another reply did the math too so it checks out",Neutral
AMD,"As a long time gooner, gamer and heavy drug coomer. I will say weed is probably one of the most powerful drugs ever. Nothing else has made me taste like I'm eating a literal tangerine just from taking it. Also, idk if it's just the concentration ""these days"" but with heavy consistent use you can develop withdrawal symptoms from quitting. Irritability, emotional instability, depression and even suicidal tendencies. Some research suggests it will lower your testosterone.  The others are obviously worse because as direct uppers/downers they are almost immediately addictive and deplete dopamine reserves instantly. And cut with nasty stuff due to the massive criminal enterprises behind them. With the fentanyl trend, I wouldn't touch of any of it nowadays.  LSD and mushrooms can can make you go crazy either by activating dormant bi-polar or schizophrenic genes (if you have them) or simply some people's reaction to entering a drug induced trip to mars.  My honest opinion is the safest drugs are hallucinogens, IF you can do it in a safe environment, acquire it safely, and don't have those potential gene activators.

AMD,I got my 9070 XT recently so I'm doing good for now. My cpu is gonna be next but I'm not planning on being able to do that anytime soon sadly.

AMD,"Ive been waiting for a 5070 super because 12 GB is kind of meh. Then I saw that Nvidia is telling board partners to source their own ram now, so I jumped on a $480 5070.

And we should _all_ cry about optimisation, _regardles_ of the performance of our cards.",Negative
AMD,"Lmao you guys are weird as hell. They complain, I say why, they say they're happy. I say what games you play, now some random tells me go away.   A 1650 can't even play unreal engine 4 games at good enough quality, obviously I'm interested in what games that piece of shit card can even manage aside from Minecraft.",Negative

AMD,One issue I see here is a lot more people were reporting CPUs dying with ASRock motherboards on the 9800X3D than any of the motherboard brands. They kept saying they would fix the issues with BIOS updates but people were still reporting problems after.  Those issues might have been fixed but I would look into it.,Negative

AMD,5800xt is a good cpu,Positive
AMD,"5600, 5700x would be your best bet if you still want to stay on the am4 platform. Unfortunately 5700x3d is really hard to find for a decent price these days.  Other option would be to look at upgrading to am5 if you want serious jump in performance. While the cpus could be bought quite cheap these days, the problem is ram. It is very hard to find for decent price...  That said, if you already own , let say 32gb of ddr4 , the good thing is that you should pretty easily sell that kit for same price you would buy ddr5 one.  That is at least what I did... One week ago, I managed to buy decently cheap ddr5 64gb ram, bought ryzen 7700 trey and board for around 500 euro. Now , I should be able to sell my old parts with 5600,32gb ram and board for around 250-300 or so.",Negative
AMD,"You'd look for a used one not a new one, they're around",Neutral
AMD,"Hold out for a 5700X3D or 5800X3D on the used market. If you really need an upgrade now, just get any 8-core CPU.  I went from the 3600 to the 5800X3D and it is an absolute game changer. Literally.",Positive
AMD,"That is why you were supposed to pull the trigger sooner. The AM4 x3d chips were bound to run out of stock. Your best best is to keep fishing for a good price on the used market.  IMO only an x3d chip is worthwhile staying on am4. Unless you also have non gaming productivity needs, in which case may be a  5700/5800x",Neutral
AMD,wasn't worth paying. Honestly at current RAM prices I think it has an argument again. 200-250 RAM really killed the cheap play of getting a 7500f am5 setup,Negative
AMD,"And people balk or get mad when I tell them:  ""Never buy the parts for a new computer over a period of months, or even weeks, buy it all at once.""  Thank you for your sacrifice, I'll be saving this post and using you as an example. I hope you complete your build soon.",Negative
AMD,Just buy the other half? Or are you waiting for the rest as xmas gifts?,Neutral

AMD,Got my 9070xt around 2 weeks ago and was planning to slowly upgrade to AM5 but the ram prices cancelled that plan entirely lol. Luckily my 5700x is still capable enough to max out the card on the games I play.,Positive
AMD,"you technically 'can' buy the system part by part. you just need to plan it so that its usable from the get go.  my laptop was my daily driver until i upgraded. the first thing i bought? the monitor. if i had bought the tower first, then i'd have nothing to plug it into. but i was able to use the monitor as a 2nd monitor for my laptop.  the next thing? cpu, mobo, ram, ssd. was making a huge leap from ddr3 generation desktop to this, so the gpu could wait since they only care about the pcie connector and psu.  the next things were ofc the gpu, psu, case and case fans.  the next items are auxiliary, like more storage, 2nd monitor, mech keyboard etc. I have yet to get all of these.",Neutral

AMD,Right there with ya buddy! I’ve been collecting parts for a few months now. The anticipation is taking me for a ride. Thankfully I only need a couple more parts,Positive
AMD,"Nah, it's fine if you already have your current old pc. I bought 64gb ddr4 + 2tb ssd first simply because they are dirt cheap at that time. Then slowly build the rest overtime.  Though if this is supposedly your only pc then it sucks, yes. You will have to stare at these parts and can only think ""how much longer"" lol.",Neutral
AMD,You could install the new GPU in your current PC if the PSU supports it lol Atleast you could use it until you get everything else,Neutral
AMD,"My cousin also had been in that situation. He got an engineering version of i9 12th-gen from an Intel engineer (which the guy won in a lottery inside the factory in Penang) for 100 bucks (Malaysian Ringgit RM 500). The problem is that my cousin just had upgraded his AM4 build to B550 and new sets of RAM. Now, the i9 box is on his current pc case, waiting for him to built a DDR5 system. Plus, he is saving his cash for his wedding, so the i9 might stay longer in the box.   He said no to selling the i9.",Neutral
AMD,I remember refusing to buy parts to build a new PC during the GPU shortage. I scored a 6800 and decided to plug it into my aging 4790k. It gave the system such an uplift I forgot about building a new rig and just kept it going for a while longer.  At the end of 2024 I finally bought everything at once. Hindsight 20/20 building then was the smart move. (although people tend to mock my CPU choice... LOL),Positive
AMD,"Just built and bought everything earlier to mid November, literally JUST before prices tripled (still a little higher than normal) and feeling good for impulse buying it all",Positive
AMD,did that once 2 years ago. most painful 2 months of my life,Negative
AMD,"I am right now staring at my case and power supply, hopefully the rest arrives soon",Positive
AMD,"I would say buy bog standard possibly old parts, complete the system on day 1 but upgrade as you get more budget available.  Besides anything else its like adding a turbo to your car, the upgrade is so appreciated when you get it you will feel likes its new again.    Also you iron out any bugs, possibly reevaluate spec or adjust to market developments.   The motherboard is typically the one thing not to compromise but gpu is prime part to upgrade",Neutral
AMD,"I dunno, I bought ddr 5 ram a month ago and I'm grinning here",Neutral
AMD,"If it makes you feel better, I just bought a whole new PC setup. GPU arrived damaged so the entire thing is sat there, assembled, minus GPU, in the bedroom. I'm currently gaming on the old PC on my new monitor. It's been over a week already.  To add insult to injury, my girlfriends build is fully assembled and she's gaming away.  It hurts.",Negative
AMD,Probably should have brought the half that included RAM tbh.,Neutral
AMD,"I wanted to create a second build using AM5 and bought my RAM over a month before I bought anything else because I saw that RAM prices were supposed to be going up. Dominator Titanium 32GB for $150. One of the best decisions I ever made, that same kit is now $479. Bought the rest of the stuff on Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales with the PayPal 20% off offer.",Positive
AMD,"If you have a working PC and you can still do your stuff on it, what’s the deal?   If you don’t and you’re trying to piece it together, then that’s pretty dumb.",Negative
AMD,Take a trip to goodwill and you might get lucky!,Neutral
AMD,"The same thing just happened to me! I was going to use the new computer to work better, but I didn't count on some unexpected events that would force me to spend some of the money, and on top of that, prices went through the roof. Now I don't know what to do.   I'm feel very sad.",Negative
AMD,I did the same thing and im here now  https://preview.redd.it/41a8vviz0u4g1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3dcdd1cfe414130c59f23fff4d0188443a65d8a7,Neutral
AMD,I did the same mistake and realized I cannot even afford 1 ram,Negative
AMD,"Honestly I was in the same position except I did buy all the parts at the same time but amazon took a month to ship the ram.....I was biting nails the entire time but it actually came : )  Also went with the 9070xt, full team red for the first time (will also being doing my first linux build)",Neutral
AMD,"i got my case some 15 months ago with 3 extra fans , some of my fans 8 months ago , psu some 7 months ago , rest of the system 24 days ago. I'm missing a gpu at the moment .",Negative
AMD,"Really? I've done this multiple times and never felt any compulsions. Mainly because I've got 100s of novels and audiobooks to keep me busy,",Negative
AMD,What?,Neutral
AMD,I learned that long ago. I have a 9070xt and a 9800x3d in my closet since January this year. But have put off getting other parts because of financial things. Now ram spiked and it'll be another few years before I can finish my build.,Negative
AMD,Ive got 16gb of okay ddr5 ill sell you for cheap,Neutral
AMD,"Just gotta buy in complete segments.  Phase 1: CPU, RAM, MOBO, and a cooler. Carried over my old GPU and PSU.  Phase 2: GPU, PSU, case.  Gotta buy the full functionality at one time, did this 6 months apart at just the right time apparently. You'll have your day eventually OP, fantastic setup you're working towards!",Positive
AMD,"I bought my parts throughout a 5 month span and I bought a majority in november when ram prices were increasing,still managed to get the best price to performance pc you could ever get",Positive
AMD,"Right.  Even for simply checking if the parts are functional, it's smart to order all parts at once.  Esp for RAM in this current market.",Neutral
AMD,"I’ve made this mistake. I planned to only do PSU and GPU so bought both in August, than a month back I bought the DRR5 set, now just waiting on storage.   If something is wrong then I have an issue, otherwise I should be okay.",Negative
AMD,"I dont know, i got my built part by part scouting good deals of new and used parts  Corsair SF600 plat 80eur (from private seller brand new)  Then after a month got used Louqe Ghost S1 with L top hat for 90eur  After couple of months bought Ryzen 7500f 120eur and Jungyue B650i 90eur  Before it arrived picked up ddr5 2x8gb 6000 for like 66eur and used rx5700 for like 100eur    After couple months got used 2tb gen4 drive for 80eur that had like 10gb written and 4 turn on cycles   So there might be risk to it but if you do it smartly or better yet have already working pc and just build on top of it until you have 2 systems then you are fine",Neutral
AMD,"I bought my system over the course of half a year or so. Saved me a couple 100€. 10/10, would do again.  Just don't not buy RAM and storage right before a memory shortage. Split your purchases cleverly.",Positive
AMD,"My first build was pieced out over months with no issues.   Case/PSU first, PSUs typically have long enough warranties that it doesn't matter much, and you don't need other parts to determine if something is wrong with the case.   CPU/motherboard/RAM does need to be bought at the same time, which is the mistake OP did.   GPU can wait if CPU has integrated graphics, and storage can wait if you got some old parts or an external drive that can be shucked.",Neutral
AMD,Yeah only an idiot would have bought RAM six months ago haha. You the genius for sure.  Lol,Positive
AMD,"I know exactly what you mean.  For my first build in 2018, money was tight. So I bought my GPU first (1050Ti). I was also concerned that the prices would go up during the crypto mining craze. Every card except my bloody 1050 Ti went up in price. 🤣.  I had to go over to a friend's place to test the card out, so it was really quite difficult.  I bought the other components altogether 1-2 months later.",Negative
AMD,"So...first time I'm building my pc myself instead of buying prebuilt.  Can I get an explanation of why buy all at once and not over time?  Ive been buying a part a month as a save and got the case, aio cooler, gpu, motherboard and about to get the cpu. Checked, double, triple, quadruple checked that all would fit in the case and work with each other.  But wondering why I shouldn't be doing it part by part now.",Neutral
AMD,"It's fine to upgrade your pc piecemeal as long as they're compatible parts. Like you can update your CPU and ram, but upgrade GPU and MB later (at least if you don't buy intel)",Neutral
AMD,He would be laughing if the first item purchased was RAM.,Neutral
AMD,"People do that?  Interestingly, the thought has never occurred to me.",Negative
AMD,I bought all my parts over several months back in 2020. I'm lucky that all my parts worked,Positive
AMD,"I can't agree with this.   This is how I *always* build my PCs. I don't buy parts unless they're on sale. I don't know that I've ever built a PC for my self in less than a year's time.   Historic RAM volatility is why after settling on my specs, I prioritize it, then the GPU. Everything else can come after.    Was sitting on 64GB of DDR5 6000 CL30 for about 3 months before I ever bought the next part lol.",Negative
AMD,"I bought my pc parts over the course of a month and I saved tons of money doing so, I used price trending to get the best deals possible,also helps that I live right next to a micro Center. Makes me the exception I guess",Positive
AMD,"I buy parts over time. saving money is saving money, why pay a premium $300+ in fees you could have nickel and dimed here and there on deals?",Neutral
AMD,I been buying parts since march when the 9070xt came out. Just built it 2 weeks ago lol.,Neutral
AMD,This only works for people in 1st world countries tho but yeah I'll agree if that's the case.,Neutral
AMD,"I see your point, but can't disagree more :)  I've been hoarding PC parts for almost 2 years, before I can complete my build with a GPU.  First, my girlfriend bought me a 7800x3d, about two years ago. A few months later I bought AK620 cooler. A year ago my family gifted me a MSI b650 motherboard and I bought 32 Gb Kingston DDR5 6000mhz kit.  And finally, months ago I managed to bought Gigabyte 9070 (non XT) and 2Tb Samsung Pro SSD.  The only thing I need to be satisfied with it - Fractal Meshify 3 case and 1440p monitor. But I will be there eventually. So just keep going is my motto here.",Positive
AMD,I'm confused as well.,Neutral
AMD,Yeah waiting for santa to bless me with a PSU and a motherboard,Neutral
AMD,Cause the 9070 XT needs something like a 850w PSU (and mine is about 450w...),Neutral
AMD,"Link it, I wanna see",Neutral
AMD,"Lucky you, i'm stuck with an 11400 and a single stick of 16GB because the other one died",Positive
AMD,"Just got a 9070 XT today (Same as OP), and I also have a 5700X and 32 GB of RAM. Thought the 5700X might be an issue at 4K, but it's not even close to struggling. AM5 can wait!",Positive
AMD,I have the exact same specs and got my 9070 xt last week haha. Was also looking to upgrade to am5,Positive
AMD,Yep. Just upgraded to a 5700x/9070xt and 32gb ram from a 3600/5700xt with 16gb ram. Loving it. I'll upgrade architecture next time (another 5 years hopefully 😂).,Positive
AMD,"I was there with you with a 3070 and r5700x, upgraded to 7800x3D and 6000 CL 15 (right before this madness) and the different is BIG. Specially on CPU intensive games like tarkov. With a 9070XT the difference would be much bigger I guess",Neutral
AMD,"I did something similar but not to this extent  When I built my new rig in 2023 right after xmas I put together a PC parts picker list and sent it out to my family and basically said co ordinate off this list and buy me something off it lol  I ended up getting the SSD, the ram, the motherboard, and the case I asked for  Went out boxing day and bought the AIO, the CPU, and the PSU, but slotted in my old 1070 for the time being as the 40 super series was set to launch in early 2024 and I planned to pick up one of their cards  Eventually settled on the 4070ti super and when I did that upgrade, I added a 2nd nvme drive",Neutral
AMD,Did it cost you a dime though?,Neutral
AMD,Actually managed to get a hold of two kingston fury rgb 32GB DDR5 modules the other day for 200 dollars (16 GB each that is),Neutral
AMD,"same here. my build is full ship of theseus'd all the way back to the i5 7500 and gtx 1070, now 5700x and 4070",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah I ordered this 9070 XT three days ago for about 600 dollars, and before that bought some unopened 32GB DDR5 ram for 200.",Neutral
AMD,Managed to grab a 32 GB for 200. The reason I can't upgrade yet is because I gave santa a list with a PSU and a motherboard on.,Neutral
AMD,"but i made the build. I'm using my old gpu, the old pc is resting for now.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah I found both of these at an amazing price (so I picked them up immediately) , and the rest i'll probably get for christmas",Positive
AMD,"I spent months buying PC parts once, but the PSU was DOA. Didn't know, of course, as it was a highly rated PSU and it was my first ever build. Thought it was the BIOS, tried to update it, then it powered off in the middle of a BIOS update and bricked it.  Never doing that again.",Negative
AMD,Er what the hell you chatting about?  Wouldn't it have been a good to have bought RAM six months ago.  If only we had hindsight.,Negative
AMD,100%. Definitely want to see if the entire system POSTs before the store return policy expires.   Store return is tons easier than RMAs with the OEMs.,Neutral
AMD,Not a good take precisely for the reason you mentioned. Saving for a full PC might take a few months and suddenly you're out priced for ram and GPU.,Negative
AMD,ya but were you willing to accept the risk of DOA parts outside of their return period?,Neutral
AMD,You do functionally shorten your warranty window on everything but the final parts though. Not to mention return windows. It isn’t just a trade off of patience for cash.,Neutral
AMD,"Market volatility, in both directions, is the main reason.  OP likely can't afford RAM in this example because of the shortages, though it might just be holiday budget issues. Either way, They've now invested hundreds of dollars so far, and burning warranty time, on products they can't use. This RAM shortage is expected to last a year, OP might find themselves unable to complete this build for many more months, effectively wasting their time, all while the parts they've collected so far are no better than pricey paper weights that continue to depreciate in value and warranty while they get zero usage.  Other way around, I've personally experienced buying parts over months, only to have parts I bought 5 months prior end up being cheaper when I completed the build. Plus it's possible you can receive Dead on arrival parts, be unable to test them at time of purchase, then when you finally build, you are past return windows and stuck with weeks long RMA processes or being screwed.  It's possible to save money by buying deals over time, not saying it hasn't worked for lots of people, heck it's worked for me in the past too. However you are just as likely to lose out on future lower prices, or market problems. It's not worth the risk IMO. It's best to have proper discipline with saving money until you can afford everything at once. This gives you a better chance to complete your PC in both an effective and timely manner.  Or do whatever you want, some people will vehemently disagree with the above. I've learned this lesson the hard way, lol, just trying to share a little advice for those who'll listen. You do you though, good luck on the future build. I hope you and OP complete them soon, and under budget, as all good gamers deserve!",Negative
AMD,Isn't that the point.   People are buying things when on sale.  Or because prices are rising.,Neutral
AMD,"Yah but that wasn't a good move. Your GF bought the 7800X3D for more than 400 probably, while i plaid 250. Depending on how much you wait, your GPU may have a better version for a lower price",Negative
AMD,Hopefully ram too,Neutral
AMD,Ahh understood. Hope they follow through!,Positive
AMD,"But what's your current setup? 450W PSU, and what else? I assume you're on AM4? If so, which CPU do you have? How much RAM?",Neutral
AMD,"So why not upgrade the psu for the time being, your new build is gonna need it anyway… so you can use your old pc as scaffolding for the time being",Neutral
AMD,"Warranty the RAM, it's very likely still covered.",Neutral
AMD,Don't you usually have lifetime warranty on RAM?,Neutral
AMD,Fellow 10400 user,Neutral
AMD,"I am still on a 9900k,only recently replaced my gtx 1080 with an rx 9070 xt  I wanted to do a full AMD upgrade before making the move to linux while also getting parts for a custom NAS, but then ram prices happened",Neutral
AMD,"That's the exact upgrade I did (still waiting for the cpu and ram at the end of the week, wanted to get a 5700x3d but the second hand prices were too high for me). I love my new gpu and yeah I'll upgrade to AM5 maybe in 2027",Positive
AMD,"Like my current build i did get a bundle from microcenter so I got my mobo cpu and ram together, but I bought my case and cpu cooler a few months before that, kept my psu from the last build and bought my gpu when I got my tax return couple months after microcenter. It gives me the opportunity to price shop and save money on the purchases while also not taking one big chunk out of my account.",Neutral
AMD,Yea I'm searching to see if I can get anything good,Neutral
AMD,oh ya. santa might take a while.,Neutral
AMD,are you 8 years old?,Neutral
AMD,I’m in same boat ngl,Neutral
AMD,"I mean, you make this post - and then decide to still delay your final purchases for the christmas price increase. XD",Neutral
AMD,That’s why you spend a little more on a board with bios flashback functionality,Negative
AMD,And people think I’m crazy for checking PSUs with the little testers they send or a pin,Negative
AMD,"I mean, whether that happens a week after purchase or 3 months after purchase - both seems like a pain to deal with and the same RMA.",Negative
AMD,"I'm saying if you're planning a build and it's going to take a few weeks to a month, it's better to buy all at once instead of buying here and there when you find a deal.  Some of those parts may be faulty and by the time you get to them they will be outside of their exchange/return period.  I doubt RAM is getting any cheaper than it is now.  At least for the next few months.  So buying now then using later is a risky choice.",Negative
AMD,"Exactly, I managed to buy RAM just when prices started to hike, got me 2x16 gb patriot 6000mt/s cl30 ddr5 ram for 130, but still fine tuning the rest of my build before I buy the rest",Neutral
AMD,"I gave the optimal take, really.  You just end up saving a little longer.  Yet it's your money so your risk.  I just wouldn't do it that way ever for a primary system, you're gambling that the parts are functional when you have no way of confirming.  Esp if they aren't name brand, you risk a huge long term hassle of trying to get the manufacturer to take them back.  And, even if they do, they may replace with a remanufactured/used part.   So that's just a bad idea to me.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah thats the risk i took, but only RAM was bought new from local store with actual warranty  As for other items: PSU probably riskiest since i bought it from a person, but it arrived new still sealed and was 80eur instead of 160eur at the time just bit the bullet  Used case - not much could go wrong either i get scammed completely or its banged up (well it had some use marks but nothing major)  Aliexpress CPU and MOBO could probably get refund if it didnt work and since at that point the parts made up functional system i was able to test it  used SSD and GPU i got from used hardware site called eneba that allows buyer to test hardware for 48hrs after receiving (until time runs out or you open dispute or you press confirm that everything is okay seller doesnt get the money)    Certainly there is risk, but i think you can manage it to a point and also can save quite a bit of money",Neutral
AMD,Sometimes you gotta make choices we don't know how bad and long the shortages will be with this rounds AI Craze.   Sure  you are shorten your warranty. But also can't tell if hardware is going to last longer yes or no regarding time of purchase.   I wasn't planning to build a new PC until the end of next year or the year after. Crypto crazes has fucked me over twice before and at those times unable to buy GPU's   So regarding budget and if you still try to get parts cheap which at this time maybe to late already. Get some parts before it does get crazy expensive.,Negative
AMD,"Why would I return it if i decided that that is my build for the next 5-10 years?  As for warrranty: Unless you are leaving it there for years, it doesn't really matter. Just check the packaging and test your stuff once you finished the build, and it will be within warranty. PC parts easily last decade(s). With the saved money, you can potentially just buy a new substitute part and still come out even anyways (at least if we are talking about the typical mid-tier gaming builds).",Neutral
AMD,"A bit less - equivalent of 310-320$. As for GPU, I run GTX 970 for 10 years. Now is the best time to upgrade, when current gpu's already established and new Nvidia 6000 series and AND 10000 series (sic) isn`t on a horizont.",Positive
AMD,the ram will come next xmas,Neutral
AMD,"I bought it maybe 5 years ago in person, i have no idea where the warranty papers or whatever is. Plus my country has like, 2 tech stores that sell pc parts in total so tough luck lol.",Negative
AMD,"The only thing that i'll personally purchase is the case, case fans, and the AIO. Those parts aren't so vunrable right?",Neutral
AMD,"I was a broke teenager at the time, AM3 era",Neutral
AMD,"what little testers? how do you test them ""with a pin""?",Neutral
AMD,Shouldn't warranty take care of faulty parts even after return period?,Negative
AMD,Because you don't know if it's faulty? Lol just seems like common sense.,Neutral
AMD,"Ik now it's a very good time, that's why i'm telling you not to wait. We had an opening from july to october, and as you can see i took advantage of it.  Got my 5070 Ti for 770€ including shipping and managed to get 32 Gb ddr5 for 95€, plus a total of 8Tb of storage for less than 50€ per Tb.  Waiting just increases the risk of having to deal with a shortage of some kind, be it GPU, ssd, ram or whatever else.",Positive
AMD,At that point 32 GB will probably cost 800 dollars,Neutral
AMD,Won't hurt to contact them and see what they say about a replacement.,Neutral
AMD,I'd say those are pretty much the most vulnerable parts. Unless with vulnerable you mean the price stability.,Neutral
AMD,You short two wires together on the 24 pin connector to make the psu think it's plugged in. The green (ps\_on) and any black (ground) best to check your specific model for a diagram on correct wires.  Some psu's come with a plastic block that is pre-wired to short the connection and plugs in to the 24 pin connector to test the psu before installing it.,Neutral
AMD,[https://www.amazon.com/Computer-PC-Tester-Connectors-Enclosure/dp/B076CLNPPK](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-PC-Tester-Connectors-Enclosure/dp/B076CLNPPK) heres one as example,Neutral
AMD,"that's a zero load testing, not enough to show what happens under load. With current psu's you will likely wont get a response, 'cause some of them have zero fan mode at low loads . But for sure i did that test a couple of times :D",Neutral
AMD,Yes.  But it is usually a much bigger hassle to deal with than a retailer with a no questions asked return policy.,Neutral
AMD,">As for warrranty: Unless you are leaving it there for years, it doesn't really matter. Just check the packaging and test your stuff once you finished the build, and it will be within warranty.  ?",Neutral
AMD,"Fair. But at the same time there will be plenty of offers in some stores or some kind of doorbuster deals, which can obviously help to buy parts for nice prices. As for prices - in my part of the globe, prices aren't nice at any time. 5070ti were and still is way north of 1000$, Ram was 200$ for 32Gb 6000 30CL. And 8Tb, I assume HDD, is about 180-200 as well...",Positive
AMD,that's Santa's problem.,Negative
AMD,Just get 16gb.  32gb got popularised because RAM was so dang cheap you might as well get double the usual amount.,Neutral
AMD,"I'll try but i doubt it. Thankfully most games i play don't need too much ram so it didnt make much difference (KCD2, GTA4, Doom) but holy fuck it made BF6 unplayable.",Negative
AMD,"Ah alright, no the 8Tb is Nvme gen 4, made of Fangxiang 2Tb+WD Black 4Tb+ Silicon power 2 tb",Neutral
AMD,I got a free 16gb ram kit with a motherboard a while back. That kit was normally 70. Now its $170. For now. A proper cl30 32gb kit is freaking 400 now. Think we are done doubling it for a while.,Neutral
AMD,I have 8tb nvme as well. Paid about $28 per terabyte,Neutral
AMD,"Ahh, must be the post covid ssd price crash, best deals ever",Positive
AMD,Well its the one that is cheaper in the end. Your links dont show how much the bundle is. But both are perfectly good for the 7800x3d.,Positive

AMD,I would go with the am5 build but get 32gb of ram. I know ram is really expensive but now you should be going with a minimum of 32 gb and ram is projected to get more and more expensive.,Negative

AMD,"Not to get super political (I know mods, but it's relevant - hear me out) - the reason that companies engage in this ""chasing margin"" behavior is because of right-wing low-tax policy.    There's no disincentive (in fact, there's a huge tax incentive) to raise prices.  If you want to make a billion dollars, there are two ways to do it - sell a billion things with a $1 profit margin, or 1 this with a $1 billion profit margin.  The structure of the taxes determines which is 'easier' or more highly incentivized.    Our tax system right now awards some of the lowest tax rates to the higher income earners (corporations and very wealthy individuals) - thus it is favorable to raise prices and sell fewer copies of each item.    This is why inflation has been so bad and uncontrollable - because there is a strong incentive to raise prices.",Neutral

But for T2I, T2V, and I2V you really need to set up ComfyUI or Automatic1111 for the best results, and that process is more involved, albeit still quite simple as long as you exactly follow the tutorial steps for Radeon on the ZLUDA Github.

AMD,Would be nice if they released this at the same price as the 9800x3d and reduced the price of that chip by a cool 10%,Positive
AMD,"I need x3d2 to upgrade, seriously. Please release that",Neutral
AMD,"So the last budget x3d chip was 5700x3d and i thought amd would give us a 9700x3d or even a ryzen 5 9600x3d full focused on budget gamers. Sad luck, companies really wont give what consumers need!",Negative
AMD,So this means no zen 6 announcement next month.,Neutral
AMD,I wonder if it already has a hard coded PBO +200MHz out of the box or are we actually going to see 5.8GHz PBO+ boosts after users tweak it?,Neutral
AMD,"That sounds good, but I think it's not aimed at users already using Zen 5 processors. Rather, it's aimed at users using high-risk 13th or 14th generation Core processors, and Ultra 200 processors with poor gaming performance.",Negative
AMD,Is it like a 9950x3D with less cores?,Neutral
AMD,"Maybe I’m just an idiot (I am), but aren’t the CPUs being bottlenecked by GPUs currently? So this new CPU won’t really see any difference from a 9800X3D, higher boost clock or not",Negative
AMD,I would buy two right now to replace my 9800x3ds,Neutral
AMD,Just settled on an ECLK overclock of my 9800X3D to 5.65GHz. Get rekt AMD,Neutral
AMD,Lmao this feels about as useful as having my 12900KS over the 12900K,Positive
AMD,"AMD will do anything but properly innovate. They hit the jackpot with the 3d cache and are just doing the most MINIMAL changes and pumping out CPUs.   Yet everyone gives them a pass. Hell their 9000 series was a complete nothingburger over 7000, and they cpus are literally BURNING.",Negative
AMD,I have a 9800X3D.  Only thing I’m interested in is a dual CCD chip with dual v-cache.  400mhz is like 4 clicks in Ryzen Master away for any 9800X3D owner with a moderately decent cooler.,Neutral
AMD,"Note that it still doesn't 404. It's also on the English site too, just change ""fr"" to ""en""",Neutral
AMD,Seems like AMD is making sure every part of the stack is secured against Intel. Not that gamers need anything better than a 9800X3D which is way cheaper.,Neutral

AMD,I wonder if owners of the 9800X3D could just OC theirs to this? I won't try because I see no need. My 9800X3d is plenty fast as is.,Neutral
AMD,I need it 🫨🫨🫨🫨 top 23 global with a bad cpu. I can get top 5 if I get lucky w silicon,Negative
AMD,"NGL I think most people hopped to ddr5 when the ram prices were stable and low for the year long stint. Also you atm, for now, can still buy a pre built ddr5 PC to float into the new platform. Might not be the best cause you aren't getting specific parts and they might be crappy parts but it's basically the only way atm to get to ddr5 if you haven't already and be able to upgrade without spending nearly as much as a GPU for ram",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, my 5800x3d will wait for at least another generation before I even start considering any upgrade. I really don't feel any need to upgrade right now, it's still doing whatever I need it to.",Neutral
AMD,These x3d CPUs negate the need for faster RAM,Neutral
AMD,"This is for people that haven't upgraded yet and were waiting for Zen 6 or prices to get even lower, to entice them to buy now with better binned Zen 5 silicon at a premium.  This product is not oriented towards 9800X3D owners.  If you already have one and somehow this speaks to you, get help.",Negative
AMD,But it will future proof me!  Buys 10800x3D on release day…..,Neutral
AMD,And then they will get a 1440/4k monitor and see literally ZERO benefit,Negative
AMD,"Update: misread 5fps as 5%. Disregard the numbers but the general idea is still the same. This just a new product in the lineup and is a nice bonus option for people who are a few generations behind. It is not a new generation for current gen users to switch to.   -----   A 5% boost in the same generation is pretty neat, since the target is for people upgrading from multiple generations behind.   I won't mind an additional 5% on top of the already amazing gains when I upgrade from my 4690k, and people upgrading from 2500k probably won't be upset either.    Remember when we had to wait an entire generation just to see an hitting for only 10% gains (and that's stretching it)?",Neutral
AMD,My ~~7800x3d~~ 5800x3d will last until the end of time,Neutral

AMD,I got a 7800x3d for around 240 also from Ali. For a secondary PC that thing is a beast.,Positive
AMD,That would be an extra 500 euros 💀,Neutral
AMD,probably not the target audience with that CPU. would be a bit absurd to tú upgrade from 9800x3d to the rumoured new CPU.,Neutral

AMD,"""hold on"" yeah man for like 8 years lol dafuq",Negative
AMD,"Well yeah, no shit.  Do you *really* think that the 9850X3D is aimed at 9800X3D owners? Seriously?  You'd have to be a moron to ""upgrade"" from a 9800X3D to a 9850X3D.",Negative
AMD,It’s a big upgrade from 5000 to 7000 already lol,Positive
AMD,> it's probably testing the waters for 10 series or something  :),Neutral
AMD,"doesn't seem like much of a point to a part with two stacked cache CCDs, having to cross them would incur a massive latency penalty and negate the point",Negative
AMD,"The 9800X3D still an amazing CPU. The new X3D will be  single digit faster at best, and you got it significtantly cheaper. And you wont have to deal with BIOS updates, since every new CPU lauch needs a mobo with the latest BIOS and else the PC wont even POST.",Positive
AMD,Ok but what if you overclock the 9850X3D to 6GHz? :P,Neutral
AMD,"The node process likely improved and this lets them cheaply make a ""new"" processor that is highly profitable.  It also keeps them in the news and sometimes is done to steal thunder from a competitor who might be releasing something new and competitive.  This is done independent of the new processor development.  They're coming too.",Positive
AMD,Honeslty if its just a tad more expensive than the 9800X3D and my 4 computers all die at the same time ill buy it for my next build. Otherwise im sticking with my 5800X3D till AM6 comes out,Negative
AMD,"Because they can? The node process likely improved enough that they can eek out a better CPU out of it. No one is losing the opportunity to buy a 9800x3d, those that want the best of the best have access to it and AMD gets to make a bit more money to fund their next generations. It's all a win win win. Why not?",Positive
AMD,"Congratulations, you are in the 1% that doesn't realize these products were never intended to be marketed towards people like you in the first place, but you just felt like upgrading anyway.",Negative
AMD,Next gen is rumoured to bring 50% more cores and introduce new types of cores as well. CPUs are just a difficult thing to innovate with. Additional cache was already a headache to implement and is expensive.   Different cores are good but cause huge scheduling problems.  It's also just funny that you say AMD will do anything but innovate when Zen is a revolutionary architecture that wouldn't be possible without their innovations. AMD already kind of innovated in the most important ways with chiplets and cache. Everything else is a bigger headache to do and not as obvious.  The 9000 series was responsible for allowing X3D chips to be overclocked and was a decent uplift in productivity.,Negative
AMD,"5000 to 7000 was quite a big improvement. 7 to 9000 was just a relatively small increment. Just like 1000 to 3000, while 5000 was quite a jump as well.",Neutral

AMD,"At that point you may as well wait for longer for the next X3D parts instead of paying more now, and now the price on 9800X3Ds are going to be less than they would've been in another 12 months too",Negative
AMD,"Wait for Zen 6 X3D, really.",Neutral
AMD,"I love my 9950x3d, can only imagine how amazing it’s going to feel for you to upgrade",Positive
AMD,What resolution do you play at? Unless its 1080p you may very well be GPU-limited far more than CPU,Neutral
AMD,"I like how you said ""since 2023"" as it's some ancient time.",Neutral
AMD,"Similar... But my motherboard is ASRock, so I'm scared of frying any x3d that I might get",Neutral
AMD,I'm pretty hopeful for the prices to actually be pretty decent. Of course you'll have a scalper period but I really think most will focus on scalping whatever server grade CPU they release alongside this refresh. Hopefully it won't be the year and a half scalp period like we had with the 7800x3d and 9800x3d. I still remember literally seeing a 9800x3d cost the same as a 7800x3d and the 5800x3d being like 50 dollars less at 600$. The x3d v cache hype was real,Positive
AMD,"The only theoretical upgrade would be 5800X3D, but it’s discontinued and not worth it tbh, the performance difference isn’t that big. I’m on 7900XTX and 5800X3D and I’ll probably also hold off until AM6. It still crush anything I throw at it at 1440p.",Negative
AMD,"For games, the only upgrade from the 5700x3D is the 5800x3D.  It's only about 5% faster while also costing a pretty penny ($375-400 used?).  And if you're playing at 4K, the difference will be even less.  I'd look into a minor overclocking the 5700x3D and RAM instead.  I think I bumped mine up another 2% while running -30.  It's only 2% but it was free.",Neutral
AMD,"Unless you can find a second hand 5800X3D, no. I'm on a 5800X3D/4080S combo and I think I'm just going to keep it until AM6 debuts or the RAM debacle blows over, whichever happens first. It still plays most AAA games just fine.",Neutral
AMD,"You are at peak AM4 gaming performance, my man.  As qFrozt said, technically, the 5800X3D is better, but only 1 to 5% faster. Impossible to notice in real gaming.  Just use DLSS to get more frames, for the time being and maybe fine tune your RAM.",Positive
AMD,"Your set till AM6, the cost of ram not worth it.",Negative
AMD,"You won't get any more performance unless your frame rate is below the monitor's refresh rate, which seems quite improbable, unless you spend all your time playing old games.  Any newer games which fail to run faster at that resolution are probably GPU-bound, which means a faster CPU won't mean anything.",Negative
AMD,"if you play 4k there is NO upgrade that will add anything.   Remember, you arent even remotely CPU bound until 1080p. and if you have really any 3d cache for stuff like super select titles itll be fine.   People need to realize that its very very likely that the CPU you have can drive 1440/4k even if its pretty low tier",Neutral
AMD,"Considering the 9850x3d is probably just a better bin with some minor improvements made, and the clocks reported need to be achievable consistently (meaning even those have some performance left on the table), I wouldn't be surprised if at least a sizable portion were able to.",Positive
AMD,"I have an ECLK board and my 9800X3D runs 5.55GHz (or so) boost and 5.4GHz allcore pretty reliably, and still has fine gaming power draw. 24.5K Cinebench R23 score on a liquid cooler for reference.  This'll be fun to see though for non-Eclk boards to let them do 5.8GHz maybe with PBO and some decent chips. Decent perf bump over the \*stock\* 9800X3D at least :)",Positive
AMD,"Not entirely, I've been benchmarking my 9800X3D with EXPO 6000 CL30 vs tuned 6400 CL30 (2133 FCLK) and there's a small increase in average framerate but a noticeable increase in 1% and 0.1% lows.",Neutral
AMD,This product isn't aimed at anyone. The 9800x3d will be cheaper than the 9850x3d for basically the same performance,Neutral
AMD,"Depends on game.  I play a lot of sim and RTS. Things that have a lot of assets needing to be independently computed, better CPU with bigger cache helps.  If youre playing CounterStrike.... not so much 🤣",Neutral
AMD,"Not true in alot of games though (especially with upscaling, which most people use), we can all look up benchmarks online to see ourselves. Idk why Redditors still keep saying this in 2025.",Neutral
AMD,I had a massive FPS benefit moving from a 5600x to a 9800x3d in BF6 and sim games at 4k,Neutral

AMD,Was planning an 9950x3D but seriously debating saving for 9950x3D2,Neutral
AMD,I highly doubt the price of 9800x3d will go down when they announce the new x3d chip. The 5800x3d sold out and went up in price when the 7800x3d was announced. And then they both sold out and were scalped for months. Then the same thing happened when the 9800x3d chip came out AND the 5800x3d chip was scalped too. I can only imagine this time around the same thing will happen except the 5800x3d won't be scalped but the 7800x3d will. And the 9800x3d and the new x3d chip. That's just a scalpers paradise for a solid few months tbh. You gotta face bot sniping the cpus. Amazon inv luck and so on,Negative
AMD,Zen 6 X3D should come late 2026 or early 2027.,Neutral
AMD,"I'm curious about the 9950x3D - do you have any clue if it's worth allocating non-3D cores to non-gaming applications like streaming to friends on Discord, browser, etc., or should I really just get a 9800x3D/9850x3D? I'm lucky enough that money isn't a factor in the decision.  I currently have a 3700x.. so any of those would be an extreme lift in performance lol.",Neutral
AMD,I had your setup and also play on 1440p. Upgraded to a 9800x3d and it made a pretty big difference in performance. 1% lows and top FPS. AM6 is still 4 years away.,Positive
AMD,"My 1% lows are much better on mavel rivals from 5800x3d to 9800x3d with oced 4090 max settings but performance dlss 4k screen. other game it helped was battlefield 6 but again with dlss... saying theirs no improvement is wrong but with the priceing of everything its kinda hard to justiefy unless your kinda in the wierd nitch im in..... If your basicly playing slower paced story games its not worth it at all. Before anyone upgrades cpu, they should check how much % load their gpu is getting during lows. i was getting down to 80% in marvel rivals with the 5800x3d so i know it would help.",Positive
AMD,"Not true, 1% and 0.1% lows improve with an upgrade to 9800X3D,but is it worth $800-$1000?",Neutral
AMD,Literally not true on games like Rust.,Negative
AMD,I need an eclk board,Neutral
AMD,"Interesting, but maybe let me phrase it another way. You can get a much better performing combo with an x3d CPU and cheapest ram vs a non x3d CPU and buying more expensive ram. So. Not that it makes no difference, but that it removes the requirement to have high speed ram for excellent performance.",Neutral
AMD,"It's aimed at me, and people like me who needs extremely fast single core performance and multicore performance but don't want to shell out for the 9950x3D range.   Plenty of applications still really benefit from high single core performance, and having that higher single core performance with 3D V-Cache is a double whammy win.",Neutral
AMD,It has the same cache as the 9800x3d though,Neutral
AMD,"People keep talking shit about cpu performance but at just 180hz with 5700x3d, almost all of my games are cpu limited in one way or another.    If we get a 12 core, 1 ccd, 3d vcache chip next gen, I'm going to creammmm",Negative

I like to do video editing on the side for my motorcycle videos and just overall have the best performance for gaming and productivity. That’s why I went with this cpu instead of just one for gaming. I bundled with the MSI Carbon x870e and no regrets at the amazing performance. I was using a 13700k before and it’s night and day. If you’re on a tight budget get the cheaper option. If you want the best of both and can spend a bit more, get this cpu.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah I had a 5800X3D, saw a pretty huge performance difference on a 7950X3D. Biggest thing I noticed was being able to run my mouse at 8000mhz without any performance penalty in games, where before I was lucky to be able to run 4000mhz.",Positive
AMD,"The biggest load I put on my CPU is iRacing in VR, but it's an outlier in that respect because the game engine is so old. I'd see significant improvement with an AM5 upgrade, but I straight up refuse to pay more for RAM than any other part of the system save the GPU.",Negative

AMD,I'm hopeful this am5 has a breakthrough cpu wise in the future where it makes this whole platform jump worth it in the future. The 5800x3d was revolutionary for the AM4...

For the last two years, almost every single one of my games crashes randomly, except for a select few, and those just started crashing now too.  I have tried every driver available for this card, and they all lead to the exact same outcome: the game crashes, and I have to scramble to reload it as fast as possible so I do not screw over my team. This has caused countless losses. I never had problems like this with Nvidia, and when I did have issues, they were not Nvidia's fault.  I have tried every fix I could find online or that I knew myself, and I used to be heavily into computer repair and all the technical PC troubleshooting. I have been scouring the internet again for a solution to something I have been dealing with for two years, and at this point I know it is the card.

Obviously if you cranked it on high, plus your PC, that's going to go over that 1800w. You can probably handle the low setting though.   On the bright side, for heating purposes, watts used is watts used. If your PC is using 600w it's also creating 600w of heat. Pair that with your space heater and it's basically doing the same job as two space heaters on low. If that's all you're using on that circuit, you can flip the heater to medium, and you have the same effect in the room as one heater on high. Personally, I can usually have one on medium, while also running a PS5, 43"" TV, PC (probably 400-500w peak), and two monitors.",Neutral

No one really cares that RR and AI frame gen may be only possible on RDNA4 but we all know FSR4 upscaling is possible on RDNA2/3 as proven by the leaked int8 FSR4 dll.  If they do not release FSR4 for older cards then it will be a huge marketing failure, especially since XeSS exists and offers better quality than FSR3.1. This is the reason why devs implement XeSS rather than FSR3 in many games.",Negative
AMD,"Am I off base thinking that calling this AMD's ""Turing moment"" re: DLSS is kinda disingenuous? Pascal was never advertised to have anything even akin to Tensor (or DLSS). RDNA 3 has WMMA instructions that were advertised on the box for AI acceleration. Are we really going to pretend like RDNA 3 owners are off base for assuming that might also relate to upscaling in the future?  This would be more like what Nvidia did to Volta (Titan V) owners. They had Tensor cores but were still left out for being too old. Despite being only 1 generation/year older than Turing.

Yes the 7900XTX is last gen now, might not get prioritised more than the 9000 series etc, but even trying to make a 'light' version is the least they could do. You build a brand by reviews and reputation than stock sales alone, if you shaft a lot of the people that last gen bought the 7900XT/XTX then they will react and rightfully so. The 9000 series already has the edge in upscaling, RT and FSR support, being newer as well etc etc. Problem is them excluding people that have good cards already, RX 6000/7000 series more than 5000 series but even still, its hurting people man, brands aren't supposed to do this within the tech industry especially when to me them cards aint outdated by a stretch at all is astonishing. Its hard to believe and surely they will create something for RDNA 2/3 cards at least because especially RDNA 2/3 cards are still a very viable option for gaming. Ridiculous this whole process from AMD regardless, its not tactical or thinking forward, its foul play and a kick in every previous gen owners face.

Exclusive multiframegen is understandable but it is worse that FSR4 upscale feature is also limited to RDNA4 while technically it can work in RDNA3,2.

A modded version of FSR4 works extremely well on the 7900 XTX, it has amazing visual quality compared to FSR3 (which is completely garbage in general honestly). Also, if modders are somewhow finding a way to make it run more and more efficiently on Linux, there's no reason the developers with the source code cannot find a way to do the same on Windows.",Negative

AMD,"There are 2 reasons why I hesitated to choose AMD for my new PC build:  1: I played a lot of old games, and with Nvidia cards, I can consistently inject MSAA/FrSSAA anti-aliasing with the control panel. AMD doesn't seem to be able to do this.  2: Will FSR 5 be available on the RDNA 4 as well? Or will it be exclusive to RDNA 5, just like how FSR 4 is for RDNA 4 only?",Negative
AMD,"There's no technical explanation in that article explaining what is the hardware feature, if any exclusive to 9000 series cards which doesn't exist in prior cards.  So is it some hardware feature related thing or software and Amd is simply prioritizing the newer cards",Neutral
AMD,No way! New feature “locked” for the latest gennof GPUs only? I'm shocked!,Negative

AMD,Just saying fsr looks like a blurry mess,Neutral
AMD,Watch them back track on this later…,Neutral
AMD,Who cares about FSR. Upscaling sucks no matter what platform. I still have 6900xt and I am totally fine with it.

AMD,Yep.... meanwhile Nvidia still gives updates to the 2000 Series....   the 7900XTX was probably my last AMD card.... next one will be 6080 or 6090 this is honestly BS behaviour from AMDs side....,Negative
AMD,Really? Right in front of my 7900XTX???,Neutral
AMD,Man. I'm glad I got a 4080 super instead if a 7900xtx. Wasn't a easy choice. But I guess I chose right simply because the the 4080 was way cheaper.,Positive

AMD,"True that, I can say it’s not a good feeling that my 7900XTX is getting shafted on FSR 4.  Next GPU might be something else after so many AMD, 5700XT/6600XT/6900XT/7900XTX, they can’t afford to lose market share when NVIDIA is selling at 5:1.",Negative
AMD,"Yep my 6800XT is accumulating dust in the shelve, might use It for a secondary build in the near future, but I'm not buying any gpu from AMD ever again.  This may sound too harsh, but I expected better after spending that much for a ""high end gpu"" in 2021.",Negative
AMD,">If they do not release FSR4 for older cards then it will be a huge marketing failure, especially since XeSS exists and offers better quality than FSR3.1. This is the reason why devs implement XeSS rather than FSR3 in many games.  I definitely agree with you, but fsr for older cards are not in the redstone, is something else they should release next year.  I would expect somewhere between Q1 and Q2 next year, but let's see.",Negative
AMD,"> AMD seems to be oblivious  That's been the case for a very long time when it comes to consumer relations.  It's a major factor in why some people turn up their noses to AMD video cards.  Look, AMD, it's simple.  No one expects all of the new software to be available for RDNA 3.  But the FSR4 support, even if it's not as good would on RDNA 3 would go a long ways.  Even if all they could muster was the performance setting and antialiasing support, it would help.",Negative
AMD,"The AMD boys huffing their fine wine so hard they forgot about Vega… the Radeon 7, and on and on lmao",Neutral
AMD,"They should just release the support for the other leaked fsr 4 model and put a disclaimer about lower quality and performance, that's it. But I guess that wouldn't sold more 9000 series gpu..",Negative
AMD,"Have you tried that leaked model? In some situations its worth it but i definitely wouldn't say ""it works"". Its not universally better than FSR3.  edit:  The performance penalty is huge compared to FSR3 (or even XeSS) on my rx6950 xt. I definitely wouldn't use it every time when i would be comfortable with FSR3/XeSS, so it cant be a direct replacement for FSR3 at least on RDNA2.  It still had some ghosting/shimmering (which is expected for upscaler) but it suddenly felt not worth it imho because the performance boost is significantly smaller compared to FSR3/XeSS.",Negative
AMD,"I know it's standard practice to always label AMD the dumb underdog, but client and gaming revenue makes up around half of the total revenue ( with client revenue being twice as much than gaming).  Gaming was their best performing segment growth wise  ( 181% YoY ) and still was only ~13% of revenue or  $3,067 million out of $24,369million  They still win in gaming gaming regardless of if we leave. PS5, Steamdeck, Xbox ... still have those sales.  AMD is a successful company outside of Red/Green turf wars. We aren't there priority, money is.  AMD and Nvidia are just companies trying to maximize their GDDRAM nut.",Neutral
AMD,downvote all you want but its true at this point.   AMD has proven there a blunder company only surviving off the skin of there teeth so to speak (GPU Division only at the moment. There CPU Division at the moment seems to have them self's going in the right direction)  Moves like this cement the fact buying AMD GPU is a bad move. RDNA3 cards are only what 1 generation old at this point.   There is no flagship RDNA4 with flagships. There only mid range at best. On top of that we will be abandoning RNDA4 for UDNA. There almost zero chance AMD will continue to develop for RDNA series.   Then AMD will be shocked no one buys there barely cheaper Nvidia counterparts that drop support after a generation. While a bunch of zealots scream about how amazing AMD is how you should be happy you can buy one of there cards for 10cent less then Nvidia.,Negative
AMD,"Xess is a bad example as it is still way worse than the Intel version and perfomance hit is big. Fsr 4 for rdna3 is not that much worse in quality to the rdna 4 version, but perfomance hit is big.",Negative
AMD,Crazy how different it is on Linux LoL 🤣,Neutral
AMD,What are they gonna do? Buy Nvidia?,Neutral
AMD,What games have XeSS and not FSR3 as well?,Neutral
AMD,Int8 isn’t performant it defeats the entire purpose not having the ai acceleration so no it’s not gonna run on some fall back mode that wouldn’t be a good experience.,Negative
AMD,"Just bought a new computer because of this (and a dead end upgrade wise for my motherboard/CPU)  But mainly the AMD thing. My old system had a 6800XT in it, still doing its thing no problem at 1440p.   But nvidia does a much better job of supporting their hardware, on top of the extra features being better",Positive
AMD,> AMD seems to be oblivious to the fact that many RDNA2/3 owners will be angry that they have been ignored and are not getting official FSR4 support. ... but we all know FSR4 upscaling is possible on RDNA2/3 as proven by the leaked int8 FSR4 dll.  Makes me glad I dodged a bullet,Negative
AMD,"I don't even believe RR is possible only on RDNA4, how come Nvidia can run it even on the RTX20  You're telling me my MUCH newer rx 7000 card doesn't have the capability a 2060 has? Come on",Negative
AMD,they really hyped up the AI Performance on release.... they did litterally NOTHING with it xD,Negative
AMD,RDNA3 WMMA doesn’t yield any more performance. It’s more like an emulation or compatibility feature.,Negative
AMD,But HEY! Atleast we got HYPER RX!!!   You know the toggle in AMD Adrenaline that changes random ass settings in your games so they look and feel like butt,Negative
AMD,They were lying and got caught. AI performance per WGP per clock was 1:1 match to RDNA2. AMD updated that and said the AI accelerator in RDNA3 does not improve performance but only lower the power consumption.  The 3x was basically 2x from dual issue and another 1x from higher frequency.,Negative
AMD,Were people upset? The original DLSS was absolutely terrible and no one wanted it.,Negative
AMD,"Except gtx except 1660s can't really run dlss, amd just refuse to make it happen for windows users",Neutral
AMD,"It is honestly just this.  People can talk about ""OH AMD BLUNDER BOO WORST COMPANY EVER"" blah blah blah, but the reality is you have always been buying AMD cards for their price per raster dollar.    And nothing else.    AMD had to go that route either way, because it lost out on the RTX and AI upscaling.  It is just that no one gave a shit about that until the last 2-3 years when it finally became good - if not necessary.   And lo and behold - here is AMD coming in with a product that catches up to Nvidia, but they have the uncomfortable and unenviable task of cutting off the old lines like Nvidia did (both by necessity) to streamline their developmental models going forward.   I am sorry for all of those who bought in before.  But really just for the RDNA3 people.  You lot bought into the whole ""WELL THE AI CORES ARE THEREEE!"".    Yeah, they are.  But they sucked and really shouldnt have been in there at all.   So.   Sorry.",Negative
AMD,"Lol when it's Nvidia people are happy to spend twice the price for their new techs, but when it's Amd people expect them to offer their new techs for free and for older generations and to pay their gpu half the price",Neutral
AMD,"But no, their marketing worked, I bought a 9060xt 16 GB for Christmas (fear that my 6600 would become a brick without technology and with insufficient VRAM).",Negative
AMD,"Don't exclude 6000 series from this, it is powerful enough to be considered.",Positive
AMD,"This one is about Redstone, not fsr4 in general. No news about the int8 version for older gens. This does not mean it's not gonna happen, nor does it mean it's gonna happen. You simply can't draw a conclusion about fsr4 support for older gen's from that statement.",Negative
AMD,"I would somewhat think that at least RDNA3 will get an official FSR4 implementation solely on the fact that Steam is basically buying 7600Ms for the Gabecube. It would really surprise me if Steam thinks FSR3 on performance mode to run 4K 60fps (which is their big performance goal) is something to strive for, cause lets be honest, it doesn't look particularly good in a lot of cases.  My guess is they are just focusing their manpower to improve the current gen cause it just makes sense in the short term.",Neutral
AMD,"It's the same with Nvidia, you can't have Dlss 4 on 4xxx series, and they never made their technologies available for previous generations.  However, people expect Amd to do it while only Nvidia have the wallet to make a move like that without risking big financial losses",Negative
AMD,"Let's not forget them trying to cut driver support for 5000 and 6000 series.... damn... and here i wanted to go amd.... only by chance, finding a great deal i went with 3080 12GB... otherwise it would've been 6800XT and then months later to find out the drivers are discontinued wtf",Negative
AMD,"100% the same, got my 7900GRE last December and this pisses me off about FSR4. Team green next time as I was on the fence last.",Neutral
AMD,Just upgraded to a Rtx 5080 last week from a rx 5700 and have no regrets. Nothing but headaches with AMD over the last 10 years with my previous 2 gpus being from them. The driver controversy recently was enough to solidify my decision to switch to Nvidia,Positive
AMD,Same here. The only reason I didnt go Nvidia for that generation was that the vram value for AMD was very good. Good to know that at the end of the day Nvidia is still a better value gpu.,Positive
AMD,"rdna 3 shouldnt be compared to rtx 2000, it should be compared to gtx 10 series. its the exact same point, main problem being that it took amd so long to get to it.   Nvidia took a big bet and took the heat, now it paid of heavily.    AMD did not want to do that and tried alternative methods which obviously didnt work so now we are in this conundrum.",Negative
AMD,It maybe possible but does it actually practical? If the best RDNA3 GPU cannot run this with reasonable performance does it really count as possible to run?,Negative
AMD,still has nothing to do with ai market share  nvidia is the singular largest company in the world purely due to ai and the almost 10 year old rtx2000 series still gets very good software  it’s just that shitty AMD culture we’ve always had,Negative
AMD,"I really dont see the big fuss about all this, raytracing is most useful in path tracing games, and nvidia will still be faster there, and games will also need it implemented, who knows if it will work with optiscaler, since they dont do denoising in same same way, its not as linear as upscaling or frame gen, so if you really care a lot about raytracing and pathtracing, youre probably going nvidia anyways, they will always be ahead",Neutral
AMD,"So you expect Amd to do what Nvidia never did, and for a cheaper price ? Lol",Neutral
AMD,Two misses out of two. Man...,Neutral
AMD,"I was ready to buy a 9070xt back in january, having already waited and gathered parts for months, only needing a gpu, then radio silence from amd at CES, with stores having stock and the release date being 24th of january, then only days before they delay it until March, then settled on a used 7900xt, and many others said fuck it and went for a 7900xtx.  What if the delay was to make a bunch of people rage buy rdna3 to clear old stock, then abandon it and force people to upgrade again",Negative
AMD,Then you are willingly being ignorant why people are complaining.,Neutral
AMD,"""You tell me that feature only announced for RDNA4, running on RDNA4 exclusive hardware (FP8) will only release on RDNA4? How dare they do this?

Do you know what happend..... nothing.  Like I get what you mean, but I have a 1 1/2 YO 1200€ card under my desk it performs BETTER in raster then the 9070XT, but has no redstone, no FSR 4 and no decent RT performance....   The does AMD want from me now? Sidegrade to an 9070xt?  The fact they abandoned RDNA3 so fast is ridiculous .... the fact that they didn't even offer me an upgrade for my 7900XTX is just plain fucking stupid... like seriously  At this point in time, as a 7900XTX user IF I wanna upgrade.... I have to go to Nvidia? AMD just doesn't offer anything and it's sooooooo stupid.  And that doesn't even factor in that they made my card basically E-Trash in one generation.....",Negative
AMD,RX9000 was the first generation AMD GPU that have good AI performance. This is inevitable. I have warned people many years ago but there’s still YouTuber telling people DLSS/FSR4 are bonus features that should not be taken seriously.,Positive

AMD,"Not much, they made a gamble like a decade ago, and they lost it, now it's time to pay the price (ie deal with angry people)",Negative
AMD,I don’t think AMD is pushing people to upgrade with this. This is just how lacking hardware features for half a decade comparing to competitors works out badly.  Your GPU is 7 years old architecture wise. And it’s not practical to support feature that would run like crap on it.,Negative
AMD,by only ~6% so not really that significant,Neutral
AMD,Quality? Can be. Performance? Lol no.,Neutral
AMD,Nvidia RTX 5000 is 125% - 300% faster than RDNA 4 at Heavy RT no way is AMD ever catching up to even half of that with RDNA 4. You need RDNA 5 for that and even then it's still a maybe. Nvidia is so far ahead of AMD people don't even know.,Negative
AMD,For point 2. The thing is that FSR 5 will most definitely be available to RDNA 4. It has AI hardware on par with the 4080 so there's no reason to.   Fsr 4 is RDNA 4 only because it requires fp8 support to work its full version. An int 8 version was leaked but we don't know if it will be officially supported.,Negative
AMD,"'Redstone' is a blanket term for updates to upscaling, frame generation, denoising and other procedures related to ray tracing. Some of this is tied to Microsoft's coming DXR1.2 update which includes support for Cooperative Vectors (what underpins ""neural shaders"").  So there isn't really any particular hardware feature we can point to here as being *required*.  Obviously anything related to machine learning would run better on RDNA4 with its support for FP8 data types but that doesn't mean it necessarily *has to be* exclusive to it.  We know AMD has at least a prototype version of FSR4 for RDNA3 in the lab but we don't know when that would be released. There's always a chance it isn't released but they have said they want to if it's technically feasible.  AMD will be coding all of this for RDNA4, optimizing for RDNA4, and then trying to get it working on older cards. Which makes sense but means there will be uncertainty surrounding older architectures.  What people shouldn't do is jump to conclusions in the absence of information.",Neutral
AMD,"It's not even an issue of hardware features or not. The burning question on everyone's mind is whether AMD is going to release FSR4 to all GPUs, and also the INT8 version that everyone knows exists from the source code leaks for older GPUs. That's it. AMD dancing around the issue repeatedly is doing it no favors. Everyone is taking the answer to be a firm ""no"" already.",Neutral
AMD,Rdna 2 and 3 dont have support for fp8 that rdna 4 has and uses for fsr 4 and other features.,Neutral
AMD,Meanwhile Nvida is still feeding updates to the RTX 2000 series x.x,Neutral
AMD,"On the other hand we also have DLSS 4 upscaling still working on RTX 20 cards. 7 years later. There are performance issues with transformer model ray reconstruction on them and obviously no frame-gen, but still.",Negative
AMD,Then what,Neutral
AMD,Connectors do not melt on the 7900GRE tier GPUs. That's more or less exclusive feature of highest tiers of GPUs.,Neutral
AMD,"""I have an 5090 now which I plan to use for 10 years"" good luck with that 12pin connector",Neutral
AMD,Virtually impossible to make it a driver feature since the game has to support upscaling and send the motion vector data. If it was possible to extract motion vector data directly then it would have been done ages ago.,Neutral
AMD,"It doesn't completely suck, that's the problem.",Negative
AMD,Since the day they have redstone demo they always advertise it as RDNA4 exclusive.,Neutral
AMD,Upscaling sux because you have 6900xt. For those fortunate enough to experience dlss3-4/fsr4 its free performance with better IQ than TAA Native,Positive
AMD,"It absolutely was, and that why many were saying that RDNA3 is destined to age VERY badly.",Negative
AMD,but but ages like fine wine! The zelots and copium addicts say ages like fine wine! They can't be wrong right? I think your holding it wrong.   AMD cares about the consumer unlike evil Nvidia.,Neutral
AMD,"The writing and hints were always there. When the 90 series came out (wtf happened to 80 series lmao), it was clear they wanted to limit feature sets. And then FSR 4 was more hints.  There's a reason why NVIDIA is seen as the GPU to get despite a higher price. Like people pay far higher prices for cars and shit. Same logic applies here. If you want more features, etc,...  Meanwhile you had HUB claim AMD was crushing the 50 series. Then other youtubers like Vex jumped on that bandwagon. Yeah.",Neutral
AMD,"And yet since the release of the RTX 2080 you guys over and over again mentioned how great AMD GPUs are because they are a few percentages cheaper for the same rasterization power (ignoring the RT performance or how the same render resolution looks worse in modern games than with DLSS). You even tried to sell FSR 1, a simple spatial upscale without reconstruction abilities or even it's own anti aliasing, has ""mostly equal"" to DLSS 2.5x...   IMO this just shows again that AMD is a bad choice for GPUs and that having a forward looking feature set matters.",Negative
AMD,And what are those updates for 2000 ?   FakeFrames ?     MultiFakeFrames?   Rebar?,Neutral
AMD,Funny you mention that. Steam machines are on RDNA3.,Neutral
AMD,"I thought about this and then saw how Valve will not subsidize it, will not price it near consoles, and you can buy SSF stuff right now on sale for $699 with a better GPU and hardware.  So I think the price they will chose is at least $699, god forbid closer to $999, so let's say $799 to start, $899 for 16GB VRAM version.  It wont have FSR 4. It will be pretty hamstrung hardware wise already for latest games. It will need to leverage upscaling a lot. It will have limited HD space...  Any enthusiast might get this for like, their dad or something but it wont even be good for the family/living room TV. A gaming laptop would work better in a lot of cases, or a custom built.  I do not think it will ""do well"" beyond enthusiasts who just want a Valve product.  Its too expensive. This is for people trying to get into PC gaming and want a all-in-one console like purchase.",Neutral
AMD,Preach brotha.,Neutral
AMD,"Yup, every tech company is now just chasing corporate contracts. GPU makers, RAM suppliers, AI providers, all just chasing the money. AMD don't give a shit if they lose your $200 when they make $20,000 on selling MI300 or whatever",Negative
AMD,Its pretty clear neither company cares about you. There companies they have no emotions one way or another. There only beholden to stock holders cause of laws. There only goal is to make money.   Fix it for ya.,Negative
AMD,"Absolutely do not buy the B580. Those cards are still plagued by performance abnormalities in many, many games that aren't the latest and most popular releases.  If you happen to play a multiplayer game plagued by these issues, you won't be able to use the dxvk workaround either, as that'll get you banned by anti-cheat. You'll end up with performance below an RX 6500 in these cases.  Even the despicable RTX 5060 is a better investment than a B580.",Negative
AMD,it is a bit more expensive but it is something to consider for sure. I also think the 5050 that while it is not great it have cude that my wife will use on her 3D renders as an architect.,Neutral
AMD,"Good to know but I'm not going to buy a new card that is already getting cut from newer features, I'm totally fine for AMD to sell last gen for the lower end but they should also support them too.  I have already burned with getting the 5500XT brand new only to see it slowly being left behind right after the 6XXX released a year after the 5500XT :(   AMD didn't told me that 5XXX was just a step stone for their RT cards...",Negative
AMD,Because Nvidia pulled the band-aid right from the start by making DLSS not work on GTX cards due to requiring the tensor cores. That's how a bad decision at the time looks like a good decision 8 years later.,Negative
AMD,I bought mine less than 1 year ago.,Neutral
AMD,The equivalent of the AMD situation with Nvidia would be their new frame gen which does not require the optical flow accelerators that were used for their old frame gen technology. RTX 20 and 30 series cards still do not get access to the new frame gen even though they can support it now.,Neutral
AMD,> they never do pass up the chance to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat  You mean defeat from the jaws of victory?,Neutral
AMD,"This is a biased point of view. Nvidia 3000 series owners dont have nvidia frame generation, even if they bought the 1500 USD 3090 TI. Same thing can be cause about 4000 series users in NVidia who dont have multi frame gen, like 5000 series has it.",Neutral
AMD,"They aren't dropping support. The older RDNA series just don't have the same hardware. Progress sucks, eh?",Negative
AMD,What do you mean they can't afford to do lose market share? They are more than happy to lose market share which explains many of the recent decisions.,Neutral
AMD,You mean 20:1?,Neutral
AMD,I have said this in the past. Every RDAN2/3 customer will be a potential long term NVIDIA customer later and never looked back.  AMD should just skipped those card to avoid bad PR.

AMD,"yes go buy nvidia, this will help, we all know nvidia is your friend",Positive
AMD,RDNA1 was basically a beta product too,Neutral
AMD,what was wrong with Vega ?,Neutral
AMD,"Radeon VII was a great deal, in the sense that you could easily trade it for a much stronger gaming card and some profit during the crypto mining craze.",Positive
AMD,They don’t need to. RDNA3 GPU runs the full fp8 model with same performance as int8. Not so fast but also not slower than int8.  That model maybe was just NDA’d by Sony.  And let’s be honest. It still wouldn’t look pretty when RDNA3 7900XTX with FSR4 run much slower than a 4070Ti with DLSS.,Neutral
AMD,That’s expected. But you were getting the subpar image quality for the whole lifespan of your 6950XT. It wasn’t a great card.,Negative
AMD,"I have tried it in The Outer Worlds 2 on my 7900 XTX, and I don't even need to go back and forth to see that FSR4 Performance is night and day better in motion than FSR3 Quality or XeSS. FSR4 Performance performs slightly worse than FSR3 Quality for me but the visual uplift is noticeable.",Positive
AMD,I have tried the leaked int8 dll and compared with the official fp8 version on my 9070XT. The quality of the leaked dll is much better than FSR3.1. In most cases I can't even tell much difference betwee int8 and fp8 versions unless pixel peeping.,Positive
AMD,You misunderstood my comment. My example is comparing Xess to FSR3.1 where we can clearly see that XeSS is better overall even though slightly less performant. This is why devs usually implement XeSS as the upscaler that works on the majority of gpu's alongside DLSS.,Neutral
AMD,Because it seems like Nvidia has thought of this by introducing tensor cores for these tasks right from the beginning. AMD decided that GPUs are cheaper without extra hardware at first and now they're making a switch.,Neutral
AMD,"> You're telling me my MUCH newer rx 7000 card doesn't have the capability a 2060 has? Come on  Nvidia added tensor cores in Q3 2018.  Intel Arc launched with them in 2022.  RDNA5/UDNA is expected to have tensor cores in 2026-2027 and that's their earliest chance for hardware parity.  We knew at the announcements for RDNA2/3/4 that they had severely reduced capability - it was a big shock to learn a month prior to release that RDNA3 didn't add tensor cores, but they explicitly told us this live on stage for free. Everybody who was researching the hardware knew.",Neutral
AMD,It’s possible that RR with the old non-ML RDNA3 FSR model doesn’t look good enough to release. The 2060 doesn’t have this problem since it’s been running regular DLSS since day 1.,Negative
AMD,Yes it's infact that bad.. $100 Nvidia GPUs from a decade ago still eat modern AMD cards for breakfast.  Now think about how much more you get buying a 5070 or 5070TI over a 9070. You're buying 10 years ahead of AMD anytime you buy a Nvidia GPU.  You buy a 4 year old Nvidia card? It's still 6 years ahead of AMD  I didn't know AMD was that far behind but they really are lol,Negative

AMD,Lmao that is so true 🤣,Neutral
AMD,What? You don't like enforced FSR1 + shitty framegen? How dare you,Negative
AMD,DLSS1 only existed for about a year (Feb 2019 to Apr 2020). Control had DLSS “1.9” in Summer 2019 that was already way better,Positive

AMD,And now? people like you can’t live without it. Ironic 😂🤡,Negative
AMD,Thats not what fanboys were saying.,Neutral
AMD,"RDNA2 and 3 can't run full FSR4 neither? What's your point? The version that was accidentally pushed out earlier this year is FSR4 in name only, barely runs better than native and is only marginally better visually than FSR3.1.",Negative
AMD,"I'm an RDNA 3 owner with a 7900 xt   To date I have never used any version of FSR.   I am apparently boomer minded on upscaling, being minority skeptic of the feature but that's beside the point. The reality is mostly just that I haven't needed to reach for the feature to solve a problem yet. This would go hand in hand with not playing (m)any games with RT thus not incurring that performance cost. I think I have maybe 2 or 3 games that to my knowledge support or use RT, and the only one that I had it on for (there's no toggle) isn't a big heavy graphical AAA. I don't own any game that I haven't been able to run natively at 4K @ 60hz.   I'm not even really sure what the games on the market today that would push it to that point are, but it's definitely not anything I'm playing. I mostly play JRPGs, MMOs, indies, old games, puzzle games, whatever.   Anyway all that is to just say no need to apologize, when I got this card, I got an absolutely massive upgrade over what I had before and I'm satisfied even if I'm probably underutilizing it.",Neutral
AMD,"Because AMD themselves set that expectation. Maybe not about the price(that ship has already sailed), but definitely in terms of tech availability.",Neutral
AMD,"Not really tho, rdna 2 doesnt support wmma instructions, which will accelerate int8, without that you cant do much",Negative
AMD,Both RDAN2 and RDNA3 are pretty weak in the regards. 7900XTX have 123Tops of matrix performance while a RTX4060 have 242Tops.  They are just not powerful enough.,Negative
AMD,"My assessment is conditional, ""If..."" The point is, IF (conditional) there was any real possibility of it, it seemed logical to think it would be accompanied by the announcement of its Redstone technology suite. However, at this point, the lack of official marketing/info regarding that possibility makes FSR4 Light support increasingly unlikely. Sadly, there's no recent, reliable, and promising news to inspire any optimism in this regard. I can only consider this lack of official information as bad news for many RDNA2/3 users, and a slight on the part of AMD toward a big part of its consumer base.",Neutral
AMD,"Mixed signals from AMD about FSR4 is the problem, though.",Negative
AMD,This ^ not sure why anyone thinks this means anything about FSR4,Neutral
AMD,"TBF I have an RDNA 3 card aaaand.... if the option is there 8 out of 10 times I prefer XESS even in the ""non intel"" version it looks better then FSR and that just blows....",Negative

AMD,"They never shut down driver support for 5/6000, but Reddit certainly acted like that's what they were doing because the acknowledged that your 5 year old hardware was in fact not new anymore and people got really upset.  Same with you, enjoy your 5 year old hardware I guess?",Negative
AMD,How was the 7900xtx a miss?,Neutral
AMD,People are complaining because they don't understand the technical differences between the hardware and how ML works.  And AMD isn't helping with explanations about it.,Negative
AMD,People are complaining because they prefer to buy Nvidia overpriced products which only put their new techs to the last generation of gpus instead of buying Amd products for half the price which only put their new techs on the last gen of gpus.,Negative
AMD,they are bonus features   if you take them seriously you end up with statements like rtx 5070 is faster than the 4090,Neutral
AMD,And the new ~~ewaste machine~~ steam machine,Neutral
AMD,"Nah you see we have to start fomenting divisions between RDNA3 and RDNA2 owners instead of acknowledging that A.) the situation sucks for both parties involved, and B.) the incoherent messaging regarding how exactly RDNA2 will get further support and exactly what FSR 4 goodies are going to RDNA3 is thoroughly inexcusable.   I suppose AMD deep down wants to pull an Intel and force RDNA 1-3 owners to upgrade to RDNA4 and later UDNA1 to get guaranteed support and FSR bonuses, but doesn't want to admit it out loud because they'd collapse into decimal percentage market share and let Nvidia win the next few generation**s** by default if they did.",Negative
AMD,"I’m not sure what you were trying to accomplish by this comment but it did not land like you thought it did. You are comparing the best of the best of RDNA2 to a midrange unit from RDNA3 and the former is *barely* faster. If you compare the 6990 XT to the 7800 XT it’s actually within margin of error, two percent. If you compare the 6950 XT to the 7800 XT you’re talking a difference of four percent in favor of the 6950 XT, if anything this speaks poorly of RDNA2. That’s barely outside margin of error.   I’m not saying that RDNA2 are bad units, this is just a bad comparison.",Negative
AMD,problem is it does not run like crap the int8 mod barely costs any performance but looks alot better amd is just being an ass again like they did with ray-tracing. so the most consumer build pascal can run raytracing but Vega56/64 and Radeon 7 cannot?(despite someone maneged to get ray-tracing on a vega 56)  sure amd very sure   Ps to the Point its Pretty much impossible to know if its on or off By looking at the fps,Negative
AMD,"quality is also an issue, although AMDs ray Regen atleast looks promising in filling THAT gap",Neutral
AMD,"""The thing is that FSR 5 will most definitely be available to RDNA 4. It has AI hardware on par with the 4080 so there's no reason to""    rtx 4000 cant do dlss4 framegen despite everything pointing towards rtx 5000 being a refresh   or how NVIDIA decided the 5000 cant do 32bit PhysX all of a sudden  so all amd would really need to deny fsr5 availability is a different bios chip the rest can be a rebrand",Neutral

AMD,"Backporting isn't something engineers like to do, particularly when you get worse results for greater effort, and it is something that sales and management also dislike because it is perceived as cost only.  I am doing some backports myself right now. But, you have to do it because otherwise you are correctly perceived as not supporting your products. And it is quite cheap (relatively so) to do so, in actual terms if you do correctly do the accounting (big companies mostly don't)",Negative
AMD,It's even worse as RDNA4 does not have hardware SER and OMM to fully support DXR1.2. I think they said it will be supported somehow at the driver level,Negative
AMD,"Turing and ampere arent that great at raytracing anyways, but yeah the performance hit is significant",Positive
AMD,And thats what i said. If nvidia fix that on their cards i will get one.,Neutral
AMD,"well if I am lucky it will burn down during the warranty.......or it won't burn at all  if it burns outside the warranty, the gpu itself would be still salvageable, and if it's reasonable price wise I'll have a professional repair shop replace the connector  worst case scenario, selling it to the Chinese lol",Neutral
AMD,I mean I hope it works like FSR 4 in the sense that the driver can inject the latest version to a game that supports 3.1 or above.,Neutral

AMD,lol all I heard was people shouting from the rooftops that 24GB VRAM made the 7900XTX super future proof,Negative
AMD,Almost the same as what would happen with RDNA 4 just to a lesser extent because it's like RDNA1.  RDNA 3 had things going for it but AMD couldn't sort things out fast enough for it to matter.,Negative
AMD,"Kinda, yeah, but I'm running an rx 7700 xt and so far there is not been a game I couldn't play well.",Neutral
AMD,I mean at least RDNA2/3/4 have all done better than GeForce price for price on VRAM.,Positive
AMD,"We were accustomed to the ""finewine"". As a RX480 owner, I saw how performances improved over time, and it was the same for many of their GPUs. The problem is that for RDNA, they made several mistakes.",Neutral
AMD,"To be fair... RT has been mostly irrelevant til like last year because most games still don't use it , and most gamers still don't turn into on because of the massive drop in performance...

AMD,Just remember to enable ReBar for the Intel cards,Neutral
AMD,Maybe. But I don't know if the 5050 (if it exists) has the horsepower to be capable at rendering for work related things.  As a hobby of course. But on the job time is money and having the right rendering eternally is not a good plan.,Negative
AMD,It impossible to support those card for newer features because they lacks the hardware to support them. RDNA4 brought 16x better AI performance comparing to RDNA3 WGP-by-WGP. That’s a huge gap.,Negative
AMD,"Makes no sense though, rtx 20 was the first to genuinely introduce a whole new tech, not simply a newer version of the same core tech",Neutral
AMD,"NVIDIA was honest with the Turing generation.  The GTX Turing cards were great, arguably one of the greatest GTX iteration, but NVIDIA wanted to start a new era and introduced the RTX cards simultaneously, which promised to have groundbreaking features but with a higher cost. Mind you, this is the times in which the flagship card, the RTX 2080 Ti, was 999 dollars. Ultimately, you as a consumer had a conscious decision to make. If you didn't trust the new technology, or were simply not interested at that particular moment, the GTX offer was great, and you could always wait for a future RTX generation.  AMD lost 6 years and 4 generations of cards while swearing that hardware-agnostic features could be as groundbreaking as exclusive ones, and they promised that they would support all cards, including non-AMD ones. They backtracked and are now focusing entirely on their new architecture, all future features locked to proprietary hardware.  People with a RTX 2060 can still benefit from most of Nvidia's suite, excluding the newer ones that were introduced in subsequent generations. AMD betrayed his buyers, even though they probably had to do it if they want to catch up on NVIDIA. That being said, FSR 4 is a mix of CNN and Transformer network, so we all know it could have worked from the get-go on past AMD cards, AMD simply doesn't want to focus on the past anymore.",Positive
AMD,"> making DLSS not work on GTX cards due to requiring the tensor cores.   Well yes, that's an architecture change?",Neutral
AMD,"They tried on 30 series and frametimes were bad, or that's the rumor.",Negative
AMD,"RTX 20 and 30 series do have optical flow accelerator... They just said ""nah it doesn't work there, trust me bro"" and blocked it off comply so only the nvidia engineers know if it actually works or not",Negative

AMD,Now RTX 20 series laughing at RX 5700XT that RTX 20 series can access DLSS4 and 1st day game driver support. Unlike RX 5700xt is in legacy mode,Neutral
AMD,Many bought Nvidia products for the same or even higher prices and are facing no such issue. Not sure that's a good argument to make.,Negative
AMD,So I should keep giving money to AMD despite them abandoning support for hardware that is still being produced and sold?,Neutral
AMD,Heck everyone already knows the RTX 4060 is better than a 7900XTX at this point. It doesn't matter.  A $300 Nvidia GPU is superior to a $1000 AMD GPU as hilarious as that is. It's true.,Positive
AMD,The fact its expected is the reason i posted my comment... Because many others in comment section act like that leaked model is superior to FSR3 in every way and that AMD withholds it from us for no reason.  >But you were getting the subpar image quality for the whole lifespan of your 6950XT  Thats not true... RX 6950 xt came with worse RT accelerators and worse upscaler compared to Nvidia but to this day im happy with that decision. I got better raster performance for less money (and more VRAM if remember it correctly). I don't use RT (yet) and im not big fan of upscaling.  Maybe i actually have superior quality because the choice i made have allowed me to play in native res. instead of relying on uspcaler (even if it is the better one).,Negative
AMD,"To me it feels like FSR4 int8 brings downsides of using an upscaler but the benefit of it, increased performance is being ""constrained"". Its worth it in some cases, but its not universally better and it dont work as direct replacement fir FSR3.  On my rx 6950 xt the performance uplift was much smaller compared to FSR3. The reduced performance uplift isnt rly justified by the visual quality uplift (compared to FSR3) imho. Especially because with uplift this small, the performance is too close to native rendering with the best quality.",Negative
AMD,"I have tried it on RDNA2. I haven't pixel peep because i assumed the quality to be better than FSR3. The performance penalty was huge compared to FSR3 (or even XeSS). I definitely wouldn't use it every time when i would be comfortable with FSR3/XeSS, so it cant be a direct replacement for FSR3 at least on RDNA2 (and maybe even RDNA3).  \+It still had some ghosting/shimmering (which is expected for upscaler) but it suddenly felt not worth it for the bonus performance because the performance boost is significantly smaller compared to FSR3/XeSS.  Maybe performance was ok for you cause you tried it on 9070xt...",Negative
AMD,"RDNA 4 has systolic arrays/tensor cores like the PS5 Pro. You can check the raw tensor TFLOP spec. Ada Lovelace matches RDNA 4 at iso-SM/CU at iso-freq.  But RDNA 5 will increase raw throughput and add FP4, likely others stuff as well ported from CDNA.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes they don't have proper tensor cores, but this doesn't mean much, as proven by the Int8 dll  I've used in in HZD remastered, it might not be as good as it is on RDNA4 but it's AGES ahead of FSR3, I've seen it run, don't tell me it can't and give me the option to choose between +30 (or whatever) fps with FSR3 and unusable quality or +15% with FSR4 and a damn good image",Negative
AMD,"Isn't this the same argument that was made for FSR4? I would've agreed with you if it wasn't for the leak  I used the FSR4 INT8 dll when I played Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, sure it gave significantly less performance than FSR3, but difference wasn't between them, it was between native and FSR4 as 3 was unusable, terrible amounts of ghosting, vegetation flickering and overall lack of detail  FSR4 gave an image that was indistinguishable from native outside of back and forth pixel peeping, and actually looked better to me in terms of fine details like tree branches in the distance, all while gibbous a decent ~15% fps increase  I would love to have it as an option",Neutral
AMD,On now this is some proper bullshit,Negative
AMD,"Don't agree  I knew when I bought it that my gpu would struggle with RT compared to Nvidia, and I still don't care now, most of the games I play don't have RT anyway, and the raster + VRAM in the others matters much more  This however does not justify locking away a tech that can clearly run as I have seen it do it (used the INT8 fsr4 playing HZD remastered), I won't complain if it doesn't run as good as it does on my friend's 9070xt, just give me the option though",Negative
AMD,"What exactly did you try to warn? Was it that NVIDIA would brute-force and bully its way to get every game dev into the ""RT and AI upscaling"" train and now there are lots of games that *need* upscaling only to get playable performance and don't even allow for RT to be turned off? Or was it that its AI hardware would be used to blow an economic bubble that also priced out budget gamers and people in third-world countries from PC gaming altogether?  If it was any of these, congratulations, you were right.",Negative
AMD,"No one cared about DLSS 1.0, not even fanboys. Back then upscaling was also much more of a big no no. That was the icky stuff consoles did. It didn't help that it looked like shit.  Control is what kind of pushed it to the foreground when it actually looked decent.",Negative
AMD,"You are aware that the int8 version is from amd and not any third party. They are working on it in the background and didn't intend to tell the public yet when the accidental leak happened. The 9060xt is out for half a year, the 9070xt for about three quarters of a year. Just give it some more time.",Neutral
AMD,It's less mixed signals and more people making shit up on the Internet due to the lack of information.,Negative
AMD,"Okay it is old they did say not completely stopping driver support but in the sense they would only do security updates or major driver updates only which said that basically we don't pay attention to your hardware cause its old despite still selling it new in various forms.  I would say this wouldn't look bad if it wasn't for the FSR4 not being available on older hardware which also hit them at the time and i see even now.  I was crossing my fingers and still do (with less confidence) that amd can somehow win some more market share and make nvidia price competitively their stuff, if i would buy brand new honestly considering prices and dlss vs fsr i would still choose 9070XT over 5070ti and 9060XT over 5060ti due to pricing. So yeah. But i am a bit worried about amd in the future.  I hope intel gpu division can pull through   As for me, i buy mostly used now since i have a kid, so well i just buy whatever i find at a very good price, unfortunately only nvidia i.found for bargains, even found a 3070 FE for £160",Neutral
AMD,Compared to 4080S - it definitely was.,Positive

AMD,"Frame generation is a bonus feature. But DLSS Super resolution is not.  RTX5070 is not faster than RTX4090, frame gen isn't real performance. But FP8/FP4/int8/int4 Tops are real performance.  These DLSS/FSR4 features are backed by these low precision matrix compute performance and are not some software gimmick.  You have to stop listen to their marketing and understand the feature by yourself.",Neutral
AMD,"RDNA2/3 have exactly the same FP8 and Int8 performance, together with fp16. There's no reason to train a int8 model for RDNA2/3.  The only AMD GPU that have good int8 performance while lacking fp8/fp16 is PS5 Pro.  That's why it feel like this one was supposed to run on that instead of RDNA2/3 dedicated GPUs.  And this model is really heavy on RDNA2/3. You got 2ms penalty from FSR3. All this evidence points to a fact that this may never planned to release for RDNA2/3 GPUs.",Negative
AMD,"I mean it’s promising compared to native denoising, but ray reconstruction looks significantly better still.  people were also saying the ray regeneration visuals looked more ‘true to life’ which is instantly a bad thing to hear because it’s just cope",Positive
AMD,"I mean. People knew the 7000 series had weak AI hardware. I remember seeing a lot of comments about that. People thought that AMD wouldn't introduce such a heavy AI algorithm when previously they'd been ignoring AI on consumer hardware altogether.  That's a very different situation from RDNA 4 which has good amounts of it. RDNA 4 should stop receiving upscaling when RTX 4000 does. Now, that could end up being the next generation sure but that would indicate AMDs exit from consumer gpus all together. They wouldn't survive that at all.  People give them some leeway at this being their RTX 2000 moment where there needed to be a separation of GPUS with RTX hardware and those without. Doing something like this next gen would be actual suicide for them.",Negative

AMD,"FSR and DLSS have always competed in the same space(advanced upscaling), but while DLSS needed ML hardware to work, FSR didn't. The issue now is that AMD realized that without the use of ML hardware FSR can't compete anymore so they're limiting the new version of the feature(and completely new features) only to the newest cards that do have said hardware with sufficient performance. So they gained praise for making FSR 1-2-3 available everywhere but now have to face inevitable backlash for limiting FSR 4 and future features because those limitations are the only way to make them better.",Neutral

AMD,"Well, AMD physically cannot do that due to lack of such hardware in RDNA3. Even worse: it’s not like they were lagging behind in technology and can’t design such hardware. AMD have fully integrated tensor core equivalent in their CDNA2 AI processors. They just decided to not put them into RDNA3.  It was pretty obvious since RDNA2 that DLSS will be the future and they will lose their own customers just by selling them the only product they have at hand.",Negative

Transformer RR takes 20+ ms on FHD on 2080 Ti, and that's just RR alone, without taking game into account. 15 FPS FHD gaming on 2080 Ti. And Transformer Super Resolution has AA so broken, I have to use OptiScaler in every game to fix it. Go on, tell me about no issues on Nvidia.",Negative
AMD,Switch for a bit to the penguin side and you'll see not always is the pasture greener on the other side.,Neutral
AMD,Exactly right you buy Nvidia GPU so you know when you spend more money on a card it will last longer than a year.   AMD is pathetic Microsoft and Sony need to stop using their garbage for consoles. Start putting Nvidia cards in those new Xbox's and PlayStations  Steam got shafted using RDNA 3 in their steam machine..,Negative
AMD,You got less raster performance due to worse hardware upscaler support.  DLSS / FSR4 is basically part of the raster performance. You can’t ignore that.  You don’t have to a fan of upscaling. It’s just something essential to a GPU as its base performance.,Negative
AMD,They do have tensor cores. RDNA 4 added them. Why do you think FSR4 FP8 is RDNA 4 exclusive? RDNA 3 only has WMMA while RDNA 4 has full fat systolic arrays like Intel Arc and NVIDIA RTX.,Neutral
AMD,"The Int8 DLL proves that you can run something which looks and runs somewhat worse than the DLSS CNN model. It's still worse than CNN DLSS on both of those fronts, and transformer DLSS (using ML) blows both away.  FSR4 on RDNA4 is significantly higher quality and significantly faster than the Int8 version, which lands it between the DLSS CNN & Transformer models.  Int8 FSR4 is a bit better than FSR3, but FSR3 was never serious competition. It's pretty much a strawman that is trivial to beat because it is and always has been terrible.",Negative
AMD,"I'm fully aware of the topic. BTW, the leaked FSR4 int8 version was part of their internal testing before the RX 9000 launch, nothing more.

AMD,"RDNA4 supports [out of order memory](https://chipsandcheese.com/p/rdna-4s-out-of-order-memory-accesses) access which will be used for ""SER"", but OMM is an interesting one because it's very likely a dead end technology.  The point of opacity micromaps is to allow for rapid testing of transparent pixels on 2d cards (textures with an alpha channel), these 'cards' are very commonly used in things like [foliage](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d4b249616f93e000149aebd/1587212042278-OG1ARIW0WOCAZPSAKH6U/13.Buildingthebush.jpg?format=2500w), [chain link fences](https://images.nexusmods.com/mod-headers/1151/39252.jpg), wires, etc.  If you've played a video game you've run into an object which you should have been able to go under/over or shoot through but bounce off because it's a flat 2d plane with a texture applied. This has been an incredibly common technique for four decades because we didn't have the computing power required to render each individual leaf on a tree. Or to physically mode a chain.  But that limitation disapears with virtualized geometry and voxels. Going forward we won't be slapping big 2D textures into game worlds to pretend an object exists we instead just model the thing.  Nanite in Unreal Engine goes this path with trees and shows entire forests can be rendered as geometry even with billions of triangles and the upcoming Witcher 4 won't use Opacity Micromaps because there are no 2d cards to test against.   So the entire problem 2d textures with alpha channels was invented to side-step has been solved.  So OMM is only going to help speed up older games but current, and certainly future GPUs, don't have a problem rendering older games.",Neutral

Like when I was shopping last year, the 7900XT had 20GB at around the same price as a 4070 Ti Super with only 16GB.  So are you forgetting that the topic you brought up was fine wine / futureproofing? Your point about only outlier titles mattering for that VRAM difference is irrelevsnt since these cards aren’t old yet.

AMD,"Basically Nvidia calls it DLSS4, but it is different for different GPu generations.  AMD could have gone that way too, just release FSR4 for all GPUs, but use different upscalers for different GPU generations internally. So it would still use FSR3.1 for 7000 GPUs, but it officially is part of FSR4.  But AMD did go the other route and only released FSR4 for the 9000 GPUs. We might see another update to FSR3 (i.e. FSR3.2) that works on all GPUs in the future, but I wouldn't hold my hopes high. I hope they release the INT8 version of FSR4 as FSR3.2 for all cards tho...",Neutral

MS Game Pass doesn't work at all for locally installed games. Heroic Launcher is good for Epic Games, but I had issues getting my cloud saves sorted, I had to manually fix the save data locations on multiple games. Can't run some of my favorite games due to incompatible anti-cheats.  I installed Windows and it fixed all those issues for me.

AMD,"AI upscaling is part of the rasterization performance. Just like how shader compute performance becomes part of the rasterization performance since DX11, the meaning of rasterization performance has changed many times. Before DX8 rasterization performance only means pixel filling rate and nothing else.  You should use AI upscaling as this is part of the performance. You rarely use it because your GPU is not capable of running it not because it’s useless or can be ignored. A 3070 with DLSS can rein same game with better image quality and better performance than your 6950XT . That’s how DLSS becomes part of the rasterization performance since.  BTW AI Upscaling is in fact not upscaling anything. Those are TAAU super sampler just named upscaling for easy understanding and labeled as AI for buzzword.  It is just a new render pipeline that recycles pixels from historical frames.  And the whole reason behind Rasterization vs Ray tracing is just because AMD failed to reach features parity after 7 years so that they have to market heavily against Ray Tracing.

AMD,They are quite different but seek to work on the same problem. SER looks at the threads and groups them into clusters (sorts them) so they operate on the same hardware units and are likely to access the same memory regions. This improves caching and performance. Though as I understand this requires some level of API support.  Out of order memory access tries to side step the issue. It's a hardware function where memory instructions are reordered under the hood and transparently to the software.   This hardware level OOM architecture should help both SER and OMM without explicit support but perhaps with the addition of some software pipeline changes coming in the new API they will be even more optimized.   The NVIDIA approach might be faster in cases where it is explicitly used because it limits certain inefficiencies but the AMD approach just works on any software automatically.  I'm interested to see how it plays out in the real world and if any of the pre-sorting in software helps.,Neutral
AMD,"Nah, Redstone is a collection of ML technologies. ML Upscaling (FSR4), ML Framegen, ML Ray Reconstruction and Neural Radiance Cache  Their Ray Reconstruction is decoupled from their upscaler for example, in COD you can use it with TAA or XeSS if you wanted to for some reason",Neutral

I see people all the time saying FSR4 and the newest DLSS look better than native and I have never not noticed negative visuals from it.

I know it's where the industry is heading and is great for people who buy 4k monitors and not 4k capable hardware, but I'm still in the boat where I run my games and buy monitors within my hardware's skillset because I don't want to have artifacts or input lag from all this new tech, although I will occasionally run frame gen if my base fps is like 120 because then I have a real hard time noticing the lag.",Negative
AMD,"There is a reason for that, but you seem to be completely oblivious to the actual reason and instead you decide to parrot nvidia press release crap.  The industry strives for upscaling because Moore's law was killed a couple years ago and improving process nodes is becoming exponentially difficult and upscaling is the trick that NVIDIA pulled to offer the illusion of meaningful generationals improvement.  This rethoric is being pushed in such a brazen way that you now have comparisons of new gen with upscaling VS. old gen native.  As for the rest of your comment.  - Upscaled content will never match native. - Upscaling is being used to downgrade the low and mid range in relative terms, while keeping (or even increasing the pricing) - Upscaling is being used by some devs to feed their own laziness and sloppiness, we reached a point in history where we have certain people that flat out say something along the lines of: ""if you don't want upscaling, just don't play this game lmao""",Negative

AMD,The only thing that changed was the availability of FSR4 int8.  Now you can have a mostly comparable image quality against DLSS and now you can compare the performance from that.  I always compare RDNA3 using FSR native AA with RTX using DLSS 3 balance mode. As these 2 looks similar enough to my eye.  Just most people back then were all onto the hype train of native resolution and ignoring the fact that native resolution looks ugly due to shimmering and aliasing that plagued almost all games since Xbox 360 era.  Things have already changed when FSR4 first appeared and suddenly FSR3 becomes a blurry hell.   It was always a blurry hell.  AMD’s pricing was bizarre due to this and to me it was never NVIDIA $-50. It was NVIDIA +$100 and came with a brainwash to let you believe it’s cheaper. Just like how NVIDIA was pricing their Fermi/Kepler/Maxwell/Pascal GPUs.,Neutral
AMD,"You have to use upscale as DLSS gives you better than native quality and better performance at same time. It’s not like upscale is trading quality for performance anymore.   7800XT with FSR 4 int 8 is slower than a 4060Ti with DLSS CNN model. And with transformer model 4060Ti can drop to a lower mode with still better quality that further increases its advantage.  Without FSR4 7800XT could not even reach a point to be considered fair comparison due to subpar image quality.  Native resolution looks super ugly today due to aliasing and shimmering. And let’s not talk about TAA which was supposed to fix those issue but makes the whole image blurry as hell. You basically need DLSS/FSR4 to get a reasonable image.  And 5070 with 12VRAM is equivalent of a AMD card with 14GB VRAM due to full memory pipeline compression, which is already announced by Sony will be present on next generation AMD GPUs. Aka missing on current gen AMD GPUs.  BTW: DLSS/FSR4 is not some Gen AI BS. This is TAAU with AI helping to figure out which pixel goes where. It’s basically recycling rendered pixels which would be wasted in traditional render and forget style. 4x 720p image gives you equivalent of 1440p pixels to works with. And DLSS usually stores up to 30 frames worth of pixels.",Neutral
AMD,i dont know if the 3090 was effected by this but i would stay very far away from cheap 90 class cards given there are alot of non working models floating around   and no its not something you can fix by backing because if you open up the thing you see that vram and gpucore have been looted,Negative

Only what they will do.  >turning down the settings does help 99% of the time  Obviously if you are VRAM constrained you will turn down settings.

AMD,So you are just nitpicking word meaning despite you have known what i meant from the start? I don't agree with you. Imho rasterization is rendering specifically excluding Ray tracing. (but i wont debate here about that since its irrelevant)  Whether 3070 can have better image quality is debatable. (i don't think so). I would run ray tracing on current gen GPUs but not on 3070 which can handle it barely and mostly require upscaling (which i want to avoid). Even in that scenario i would maybe preferred RT off with super sampling for best AA.  Not mentioning VRAM limit which can cause stutters even in 1440p.

AMD,"Well of course. But AMD already crated the model for INT8, so they have already done it.. And I'm not implying they should support a modded version or the FSR4 FP8 emulation that people ran on Linux.   My point is that they already did the INT8 model, and it clearly works and it has better image quality vs FSR3. So it's not like the cards are unable to run it like the FP8 model which RDNA3 completely lacks the instruction set to work... It's there and it works...the  bulk of the work has already been done...so what the hell?",Neutral
AMD,the trade off to that thinking is. Clearly people will go with a superior better supported product.   The product might cost 10% more in this case. That 10% gets you continued support and improvements. Thus aging better then the compaction.   AMD never going to get anywhere and maybe thats the overall goal to be mediocre to barely push. So that Nvidia never gets the idea to push into the CPU realm.   Nvidia CPU could crush Intel and AMD both just from R&D standpoint. (More money better R&D),Neutral
AMD,"It yields better performance for the software that actually uses it.  Most things don't right now, and won't for years since it requires at least a recompile to use and most companies can't be bothered to do a new release just to support 1 instruction.  Lots of games either don't support NV's tensor cores or use them inefficiently so there is little to nothing to notice for your average gamer there too.  That is why pure raster performance still mattes lots.  Most games still don't support raytracing and there is still very little AI related stuff in games.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, they shouldn't have allowed that leak to happen if their plan was making FSR 4 exclusive to RDNA 4.",Negative
AMD,The leak is not targeting your GPU. RDNA3 runs int8 and fp8 with same performance. It is most likely a PS5 Pro version leak.  At this point it’s pretty obvious AMD don’t want people to look at their bad old generation GPUs and just pretend they didn’t exist.

AMD,Even switch 2 could runs game in ray tracing now. This is a performance optimization method. Not some eye candy FX that cost extra performance  And even without Raytracing 3070 is already faster than your 6950XT thanks to DLSS transformer model.  You can doubt all you want but seeing FSR4 running on your 6950XT should already give you some idea.  3070 is a way cheaper GPU that have 8GB VRAM. But a 3080 with 10GB VRAM should have no issue as that is equivalent of 12GB VRAM from a AMD card. Plus it is still cheaper.  AMD was charging way beyond the performance of RDNA2/3 and leans heavily on marketing against ray tracing. They knew this will happen since all current gen consoles market heavily on Ray Tracing despite using AMD GPU.,Neutral
AMD,Sounds about right for reddit. I learned in the apple sub reddit people will cheer to pay more for less. Its insane.,Neutral
AMD,"To be fair, we are forgetting how insufficient DLSS was until around 2022 into 2023.  FSR being around as a way to compete also meant if your card really was struggling, you, too, could have a ghosting image for a few extra frames of performance on whatever card you had.   The 7000 series of cards came out right around the time DLSS actually was great - but as a tech feature, you couldnt really appreciate it until you experienced it yourself.   And for those tight on a budget, a 7000 series card could likely outperform anything a comparable nvidia card setup was going to get you.   But for sure, it was only in the short term that the lack of having a developed feature set was going to bite anyone.  And for *any* company, its not like you can expect it to sell someone else's feature set over its own.   No matter how I look at it, some lineup from AMD was going to get bit hard if or when it ever caught up.  And this time, it was the RDNA3 lineup.   At least they can still raster well, tho?",Neutral
AMD,"I'm still not a fan of upscaling techniques. I'm pretty sensitive to visual artifacting and I was a late adopter of LCD's back when CRT's were still around.  LCD's had a myriad of visual issues that just put me off. Terrible contrast and poor colour reproduction, things like dithering etc making smoke look like oil on water. Fixed resolutions too, so back then if you dropped your res the LCD had to do the scaling which looked awful.  Yes, the LCD took up less space, used less power but it was early in the development cycle. CRT's just blew them away in so many areas.   DLSS / FSR / XESS are all early technologies. None of them are free of wierd artifacts but they will get better, I'm sure.   The point of the story is that it is okay for people to dislike a technology until it is more mature. Upscaling is at that point for me, it's early LCD tech where given a few more years it will be really worth using. I'm not going to be bullied into liking it because there is a turf war between AMDolts and Nvidiots.   Eventually DirectX and Vulkan will codify it so that it's part of the game rendering standards and we can be done with support for each type being patchy, the tech will get better and it will just become a normal part of gaming. I'm happy to sit it out while everyone bickers over who is winning and losing and use it when it's more mature. I'm not going to base a purchasing decision on that one feature though.",Negative
AMD,"No offence but you're making claims based on your personal experience. My personal experience is that I can always see a visual degradation. It may be very minimal, but it's there when I'm looking at the screen. This is no different than people saying they can't see the difference between 60 fps and 120 fps. Some can't. Some can.  If the tech ever gets there of course I'd use it. Like I said. It isn't there for my eyes whether it is for yours or not. And that's okay.  I run AMD so I don't use DLSS. I have a 7800XT. My wifes PC is a 4070Ti and she does use DLSS and doesn't notice a difference unless I point it out. She games but doesn't do PC shit so I always set everything up. Every single time I've seen DLSS on her machine I can tell it's on. Same with FSR on my machine, but to an even greater extent.

And FSR3 isn't just pixelated on static imagery, but creates massive fizzle and pixelation in motion.  The fact that you're comparing static imagery and acting like it's comparable to FSR3 is revealing. The majority of how an upscaler functions is in motion.  FSR3 isn't in any way comparable to DLSS. It mostly destroys objects in motion. DLSS4 has minor artifacting and a tendency to be slightly sharpened (which can often be adjusted).

I am not unhappy with the current GPU, but worried about price increases due to RAM impacting GPUs. I can afford the upgrade, but still try to avoid wasting money. Good upgrade or irrational FOMO?",Neutral
AMD,"My 3080 puts in work. And my 3770K! while decrepit and senile, is still running strong, and I can play a lot of games with DLSS upscaled to 4K. I had to put my upgrade sans GPU on hold because of all the bullshit happening. I don't care either, as my backlog is still big as mofo and not going away any time soon. I have a PS5 Pro to tide me over too.  Sucks but it surprised me how well this thing runs games still on a 4K desktop even. Of course it ain't doing Raytracing in Cyberpunk or anything, but I don't care about that. It actually does ray tracing fine in GTAV Enhanced though and runs really well there with DLSS.  I do have to restart my PC more often, and the CPU is a huge bottleneck, but I am waiting for the next major AMD CPU. Or something on super sale I guess.",Negative
AMD,"OTOH, I was over here wondering if upgrading from a 1080ti to a 9700XT was going to be worth it when my old card started failing. I make a terrible gamer.",Negative
AMD,"Tbf, its not like some of these titles releasing in the recent times are well optimized. Some run so rough that anything less than top end can't even get a stable 60 fps with top end rigs with stuff like AI upscaling.   Not saying that justifies buying while prices are jumping, but the entire space is a mess.",Negative
AMD,"Yes and no, If you are building a system for 2k, with a 7800x3d, getting a 9800x3d is just 100 eddies more. 2100 vs 2000. I rather have the latest gen processor for the 5% price increase, even if ""today"" on 4k that might not increase my fps.",Negative

AMD,I have the same exact PC as you. I see no reason to upgrade until AM6,Neutral
AMD,"GPUs and CPUs are made from the same thing, wafers, so if they are ramping up gpu production it can cause wafer prices to rise for CPUs too.",Neutral
AMD,"It's about an 85% uplift in performance according to TechPowerUp's relative performance chart, plus whatever value you place on having access to FSR 4. So it's a pretty worthwhile upgrade, I think, but whether you feel like you need it or not will depend a lot on what games you play now and what you see yourself playing in the next couple of years.  Because if you don't buy one now you probably should give up on the idea of getting one until at least 2027 at a minimum, since the memory shortages are going to fuck GPU prices very shortly. GDDR is made in the same fabs as regular DDR and HBM, so supply is going to be severely constrained and GPU prices will rise accordingly. I'm not even going to try speculating how big of an increase that'll be; I'm the idiot who read warnings about RAM prices going up and assumed that would mean a 20-30% hike or so.",Positive
AMD,For 6700 it seems fine. I believe the 9070 is among the best values out there. I have one in my pc and run games at 4K often (not always). It’s a great card. It should last 4-5 years at 1440p for sure.   The price hike is real though. Get it sooner than later.,Positive
AMD,"I am upgrading my 6700 xt to a 9070 xt and I don't game all that often. It will be worth it in the long run I think. The 6700 xt while still a solid performer, definitely trails a lot of cards out there on the new market.   I've been building PC's and troubleshooting for over 20 years now. The best time to buy parts are when you have the money, prices are at their lowest point (new market), and when you are on the edge of an upgrade.  Point being, buy ahead of the curve. Plus you can sell the 6700xt for decent money right now. At least get $200 for it minimum.",Positive
AMD,only do if you are passionate about a game you cannot play **right now**,Neutral
AMD,"I made the same upgrade as you last year. Yeah, its a good upgrade, although I play at 4K     Anyway, as the current price a 9079xt is a good buy considering that for 2K you'll be set for about 5 years, and keep in mind the money you can get from selling the 6700xt .",Positive
AMD,"I just made that upgrade. Most games are 50-70% faster, ray traced games are more like 3-4x higher performance. Running Cyberpunk 2077, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, at 1440p max settings with high ray tracing and FSR 4.0 Quality and getting \~80 fps in both. Compared to like 20 fps with ray tracing low on the RX 6700 XT.   Going to test Witcher 3 and WarThunder later. But either way, it made ray traced games actually playable, with good performance vs it basically not working on the 6700XT except for the lightest RT enabled games, like the 1st Spiderman game.",Positive
AMD,"You are definitely doing a good upgrade I would go with the 9070 XT.  But if you're staying at just pure 1440p and never plan on going to 4K go with the 9070 you can undervolt it get much better speed and lower power pull.  So if that costs you let's say 500 bucks or so $550 don't know what the price is I paid $630 for my 9070 XT.   You sell your card hopefully you still have the box and everything where you can sell it for more if you have everything with it and it's in good condition.   Let's say you get $250 for your card or 225 really don't know the market for the 6700 series basically you will be spending around $250 to $275 for a humongous upgrade.   Remember not only is the uplift huge where you'll be getting much more frames per second and you'll have much better 1% lows less dips.  On top of that you have Opti scaler.. which to me was the selling point because it's on GitHub it allows you to insert fsr4 into almost any game.   It's 100% free software and it just keeps on getting better and better.   Simple to use, so if you have a badly optimized unreal engine 5 game or just a badly optimized game this will definitely help out a bunch even though you should be running great at 1440p.   Remember the 9070 can be undervolted it takes much less power, faster, and even better cooler by at least minimum 10° at least sometimes much more.   Me I have mine set at only -40 MV offset, and minus 5% power draw, and I believe the memory is set at 2614.   I pull about 290 Watts at full load doesn't go above 66 °.   I can barely hear the fans.   My 6800xt was and is a great performer, but it did pull a lot of wattage about 286 Watts at full load that's without doing any undervolting but still I'm not pulling that much more now.   As long as you're paying a decent price for the card and you're not paying a premium and you can get a decent amount for your card it's definitely worth it.   Remember opti-scaler.. is the game changer to me for people who want to run at super high frame rates or games with heavy Ray tracing that gets some really bad frame rates.   You either pull the trigger now or you wait about 2 years.   Again I hope you're paying a good price no premium, don't need RGB lights none of that garbage, all you want is something that is nice quiet and does its job.   I would look around on Facebook marketplace or Craigslist and see what people are asking for the card that you currently have.   For me I see the asking price at about $350 I will ask for around $300 to 330 but mine is in mint condition with the box and everything ( 6800 XT)  And I'm sure the person who's going to buy mine is going to sell their 5000 series or whatever they're running and then add that to the card that they're buying which would be mine to offset the price.",Positive

AMD,The 9070 really shines in efficiency. For a card that rarely pulls above 200w it is punching above its weight and the lower power draw should mean great longevity and reliability.,Positive
AMD,"Good points, especially about reselling the 6700xt.",Positive

AMD,The Article says the 9070XT goes head to head with the 5070  But I thought it fights the 5070TI?  Like 3% diff max ? :o,Neutral
AMD,"""5070 lineup"", weird way to say 5070/5070 Ti. The sentence right after says it competes with the 5070 AND 5070 Ti, so half right?  I guess whoever wrote this was considering the 9070 lineup (9070/9070 XT) vs. 5070 lineup (5070/5070 Ti) since that's where most of the competition lies between NVIDIA and AMD right now. But yeah you're right that the 9070 XT is better compared to the 5070 Ti than 5070 as it's 25-30% faster than the 5070.",Neutral

AMD,"Hello, I just wanted to vent my frustration with AMD.  I have been a long-term Nvidia user, and when I upgraded my PC, I figured I would give AMD a chance. I regret that decision completely. For the last two years, almost every single one of my games crashes randomly, except for a select few, and those just started crashing now too.  I have tried every driver available for this card, and they all lead to the exact same outcome: the game crashes, and I have to scramble to reload it as fast as possible so I do not screw over my team. This has caused countless losses. I never had problems like this with Nvidia, and when I did have issues, they were not Nvidia's fault.  I have tried every fix I could find online or that I knew myself, and I used to be heavily into computer repair and all the technical PC troubleshooting. I have been scouring the internet again for a solution to something I have been dealing with for two years, and at this point I know it is the card.  I will never purchase an AMD GPU again, and honestly I would welcome an Nvidia monopoly if this is the best AMD can do to compete.",Negative

AMD,"The most important characteristics of a laptop are battery life ( power efficiency) and screen quality. That is what sells ( non apple ) clamshells.    All the other crap they test in various reviews are mostly meaningless to the actual user. There is a very small %age of the market for high power/perf laptops and even smaller market for gaming.   Most of the reason a laptop is “slow” is bloatware and has nothing to do with the cpu choice anyway.  And Intel is already “beating” AMD in laptop cpu sales, by a substantial margin. People incorrectly assume AMD has most of the market share in all segments because of the very noisy and super-biased gaming reviewers, who mostly focus on $3000+ gaming desktop builds. Yes AMD is handily winning there.",Neutral

AMD,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works. It's like the 2001 Toyota of the laptop world, it's not winning prizes for looks, but it'll never die, gets good mileage (battery life), and is easily repairable. Maybe not the laptop you want, but definitely the one you need (excluding people who need something like a dedicated GPU or really need super high CPU performance).",Positive

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance. I’ve shown full system specs and game settings every time, and provided more evidence than any tech site or tech YouTuber ever has, yet some people are still in denial.

Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU.

In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all.

AMD,"True, except AM5 supported all cpus 7000, 9000 and will support the newest one. So not exactly true per se, because you need a new motherboard every time and those on AM5 can upgrade cpu without buying a board. Imagine if someone was on 13400F and wanted to buy lets say 285K? Well, you need a new board. So it depends what “cheaper” is seen as.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep. We all see the patterns here. Gamers nexus, HUB, LTT and most big name they all keep mocking Intel, even when Intel did good job to bring improvements to their products like fixing Arrow Lake gaming performance but those ""tech reviewer"" decided to be blind, they don't even want to revisit Intel chip and benchmark it, they don't even want to educate their viewers.    At the same time they keep overhyping Amd products to the moon like they own the stock, it's obvious now who is the real reviewer and who is fraud reviewer using their own popularity and big headline to spread their propaganda for their own benefits.

You can say that all you want but there's a reason why in the diy market everyone is buying amd over intel. People know arrow lake is doa where as am5 actually has a future, which is why everyone is flocking to the 9800x3d in droves.  Zen 7 is rumored to be on am5 as well. Meaning that am6 would come out in 2030/2031. If that's true am5 lived for around 8/9 years.  That's insane value to get out of one socket.",Positive

Most tend to skimp, only to end up buying another middling CPU the following year, and then again after that. And so the cycle trundles on.  When I buy PC parts, I usually go for the best available. Provided the price is reasonably sane. I picked up a 9900K seven years ago and it’s still holding its own. Is it on par with the 9800X3D? Of course not. But it’s still a very capable bit of kit. Next time I upgrade, I’ll go top shelf again.",Neutral

A good third party reviewer would be needed to determine by how much, yet it’s probably not worth their money and time to test it.   So the truth is probably in between what Intel is saying here and what the state of things was 6 months ago.",Negative

AMD,"Hi all,  I ordered a contact frame from Thermal Grizzly because the temperature of my CPU wasn’t great, and I was tired of the fan noise.   I installed the contact frame in August, and everything was fine until two weeks ago, when the desktop suddenly stopped booting. The fans were spinning, but there was no POST, no debug LED — nothing. I thought the motherboard was dead.   However, when I removed the AIO head and tried to boot again, it worked!  Since then, I’ve been experiencing intermittent no-POST issues, especially after gaming sessions.   To get it to boot, I always have to adjust the screws on the AIO head. If it’s too tight: no POST. If it’s too loose: CPU temperatures are high. For example, in Hogwarts Legacy, I get around 60 FPS with an RTX 4090, while the CPU runs at around 18% usage @ 85°C. Which is not normal at all, as I used to run the game at around 100–110 FPS.  I tightened the screws on the contact frame using my thumb and index fingers.   I’m looking for advice from anyone who has encountered a similar issue, because at this point my only idea is to remove the contact frame and reinstall the original one.  For context, my setup is from November 2022, and I installed the contact frame in August 2025. I have never removed the CPU from the socket since the first installation.  Thank you all.",Negative

AMD,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets).

When the cooler is tightened too much, it can cause the CPU or motherboard to bend slightly, which may lead to poor or lost contact between the CPU and the socket pins. This prevents the processor from initializing properly, resulting in a no-POST condition. Installing a contact frame changes the pressure distribution compared to the stock retention mechanism, so overtightening the AIO screws can amplify this issue. On the other hand, if the screws are too loose, the CPU temperatures will rise because the cooler is not making proper thermal contact. To avoid these problems, ensure the AIO screws are tightened evenly in a cross pattern and do not exceed the manufacturer’s torque specifications. If the issue persists, you may need to verify that the contact frame is correctly installed or temporarily revert to the original retention bracket to rule out pressure-related problems.",Neutral

AMD,"Actually, this is not the case. After spending hours on this issue, I've finally found the 31.0.101.4502\_A14 drive at Dell's website that is working without any problems with the 3440x1440. So your claim that HDMI 1.4 is limited to 2560x1440 is false. HDMI 1.4 can go further to 3840 x 2160 without any problems. It's unacceptable the lack of support for UWM from Intel graphics cards and drives. Many previous drivers let you choose 3440X1440 resolution. Why did Intel stop supporting this resolution in the last graphics drivers?",Neutral
AMD,I was going with the 265K over the 9800X3D since the Intel stuff seems to get better 1% lows and smoother experience at 4k and above. But does DLSS change that? Does DLSS lowering the render resolution push the 9800X3D back into the lead?,Neutral

AMD,"Most commenters are wrong or didn’t read all the articles. Nvidia wants some custom SKUs of server chips to pair with its data center GPUs, and Intel wanted a better solution for pc parts for the GPU tiles.   NVIDIA is NOT getting an x86 license, nor do they want one. In case you haven’t noticed, Nvidia is a $4T company largely on sales of data center GPUs, sales of which were 10x the gaming segment. Profit/earnings ratio of data center is even higher than the 10x.   In my opinion, the only reason for Intel to use RTX chiplets on pc parts is so they can have a few skus for mobile gaming. Lower end laptop chips would still use Xe cores.  This solves NONE of intel’s structural issues - they need, in this order  1. Major foundry customers  2. Regain server market share 3. Data center GPU offerings 4. Move all pc chiplets back to Intel nodes and start to fill up the fabs again",Neutral
AMD,An Intel + nVidia handheld would be something I would welcome just for DLSS4 alone.,Neutral
AMD,"I don’t think it will change that much overall.  It’s no secret that NVIDIA wanted a x86 license for decades now and now they basically got it.

AMD,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive. I know they have a lot of tricks up their sleeves still, like designing HBM memory onto the die (how Vega was supposed to be originally) and unified memory (soldered down, see the new AI branded chips).",Negative
AMD,Ohh noooerrrrrrrrr,Neutral
AMD,"Actually this may be good for AMD and I will tell you why: Open source drivers. Nvidia if they had a say in intels graphics division would make the intel GPU stuff proprietary and locked down and when support ends its gonna hurt. Meanwhile AMD has open source drivers and in the age that linux is gaining popularity will make it the preferred platform for anyone interested in the growing linux ecosystem. Nvidia will NEED to change how they handle things or intel may not be as attractive as they once were, intel has already suffered a massive knock on thier reputation and this may be the mortal wound that can work in AMD's favor.",Neutral
AMD,"I don't see how this means anything at all for AMD in desktop. This is borderline irrelevant for desktop gaming. Most users pick up an Intel or AMD CPU and an NVIDIA dGPU.  APUs don't really exist in desktop gaming.  In mobile? I think most people won't care much. Intel and AMD APUs both offer compelling and reasonable alternatives for everyday usage. Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.  In all other cases I dont see this being a compelling option.",Neutral

Of course I think they also had much rosier projections for their other ventures when they started this journey, so who knows if the GPU losses are still tolerable.",Negative
AMD,Intel doesn't have a current gen A310 competitor either.,Neutral
AMD,Theres no way that nvidia is gonna let intel keep producing entry level gpus that directly compete with their own. I know their deals are in regards to apus and to compete with strix halo but nvidia is not gonna invest into a company with a competitor to their gpus.

AMD,Their nForce boards were excellent for overclocking and tinkering! That's for sure. I also remember them being a bit buggy lol.,Neutral
AMD,IIRC that wss the AMD Turion X2 + NVIDIA 7300Go laptops. Those were notorious for dying.   I also remember some budget laptops with the Turion X2 + ATi 3200 chopsrt graphics would die due to graphics desoldering off the board. The GPU would sit at the end of the heatsink and burn up.   The 9400M MacBooks I remember would get hot enough to start leaving powder from the chassis on my desk lol.,Neutral

AMD,"They're already at 2, going on 3, generations of losses though (Intel discrete GPU's basically have 0 marketshare, even worse than AMD who are also doing really badly) so even if that were true that isn't a reason to be optimistic.  As a company they also seem to be desperate to get income as well and so there is no reason to assume they're going to tolerate that situation for all that much longer.    I doubt they'll entirely kill off their GPU division, they can still do iGPU's which will be good enough and cheaper than paying NV a royalty, but the discrete GPU line is clearly in trouble.",Negative

AMD,"3D cache will eventually become full of assets and dip, if and onlyif IMC is bottlenecked by random memory access.  - the ability for cache to transfer data from memory, to IMC, to cache has a FPS hit (cache hit-rate). This is due to the bottleneck of a chiplet-based IOD: compromising memory latency with cache hit-rate. Eventually the cache fills and relying on IMC to feed the cores anyway.  You can easily test this by monitoring 1% lows and increasing memory latency (lowering DDR4 B-die clocks/DDR5 hynix and increasing timings) to see how Cache holds up when full of assets while memory is being bottlenecked-   What games need is 10-12 P-Cores and an IMC capable of high speeds.

As for clocks, the core scales to max 5.2ghz (default 4.6ghz), certainly overall slower than Zen 4. IPC is a comparison about throughput at a given clockspeed. Its a give to compare you will need to match the clocks.  Funny you you should mention latencies, considering that core to core (even accross clusters), latencies of Skymont are better than Lion Cove? So if latency is the issue, it has nothing to do with Skymont and everything to do with the trash uncore they have based on the Meteorlake SOC. Even workstation Crestmont on a different package performs better. Furthermore skymont IPC is measured based on Arrowlake. Arrowlake is worse latency than Raptorlake and Zen already.

AMD,"Do tell how a bigger cache makes games faster, if you are aware of some details.  And, of course, how doubling the already tripled cache will yield perf improvements worth the huge amount of extra money to make such chips.",Neutral
AMD,Any efforts of Intel to improve efficiency and even performance on old products is a pro-consumer move. Good to see.,Positive
AMD,It's not sorcery. Its just Intel doing the game developers work.,Neutral
AMD,"Is it updated? Last time I tried it, it didn't have an uninstaller and not many games were supported. In the ones I tried, there was no difference at all.",Negative
AMD,"It's very specific scenarios where this can unlock new performance, most games it won't do anything or even lower performance.     So they can't *really expand it* since it's an uncommon scenario. That's why we have so few games that benefit from it.",Negative
AMD,Never count out Intel. They have some very talented people over there.,Positive
AMD,"Regarding the cache optimizations you pointed out, I have a question. Can you test all APO supported games you own and capture the utilization of the E-cores ?  My understanding is that Intel is keeping 1 E-core per cluster active and parking the remaining 3 E-cores. So the lone E-core of each cluster has full access to the 4mb shared L2. For the i9 they can have 4 such solitary E-cores that have their own cache and hence do not touch the L3 cache. The 4 E-cores handle background task while the 8 P-cores with the full 36mb L3 cache deal with the games.  Please correct me if I am wrong.  Also, what cpu cooler do you use ?",Neutral
AMD,What about this post saying APO havent gotten anything in over a year.. https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/s/tTKCn1CnDZ,Neutral
AMD,Does anyone know if changing the Windows power plan affects performance? What Windows power plan do you recommend for the i7 14700kf? Balanced? High performance?,Neutral
AMD,I wonder why APO isn't just tied to game mode. That way it would work for all games from ADL to ARL.,Neutral
AMD,"or just get rid of E cores. I know all the non engineers in here think they are great, but real world they are crap, this is just another in a long line of examples of why intel needs to ditch them.   anyway go ahead and downvoted me becuse being correct in this sub is looked down upon.",Negative
AMD,A few years ago you'd have to tweak the hell out of AMD CPUs to get comparable performance to Intel equivalents. Now the tables have turned.  In either case those who know how to tweak will get top performance not matter the platform.     Kudos,Negative
AMD,Let me teach you a trick.... there is a hack to disable e cores for every game using Intel compatibility tool.... you can try yourself to see if it works,Neutral
AMD,I will follow all!,Neutral
AMD,Congratulations on getting a CPU that didn’t fry itself.  Consider yourself one of the few lucky ones.,Positive
AMD,"It looks like Intel APO almost completely disables the efficiency cores for the game when you look at the screenshots I posted below with per core activity.  But this performance boost likely cannot just be gained by turning off the efficiency cores in the BIOS yourself I wager, because it would be too simple.",Negative
AMD,How is this doing the game developers work?,Neutral
AMD,"It's updated as far as I know, but not for every platform.  If you're on Arrow Lake you have the new games that were added, but if you're still on Raptor Lake then you only have the original titles.     This sucks because I own BG3, which is one of the new titles they added recently along with Cyberpunk 2077.",Negative
AMD,"They have added a few new games, but it appears you need to have Arrow Lake to be able to apply APO on them which is BS!  They need to have a better system than this.       The DTT driver should be downloadable from Intel, and not from the motherboard manufacturers who cannot be trusted to make the latest version available.",Negative
AMD,The intel software team is pure black magic when they allowed to work on crack.,Neutral
AMD,"Here is a screenshot showing CPU activity across all cores.  This is with HT disabled BTW, and the cooler is an Id FROZN A720.  It looks like the efficiency cores are not engaged in this particular game when APO is enabled.  And Metro Exodus is the only game that I own in the current lineup for the 14900K.  I know they've added some games for Arrow Lake (like Cyberpunk, Baldur's Gate 3) but those games still aren't available yet for the 14900K     [https://imagizer.imageshack.com/v2/3528x1985q90/923/hh8Guk.png](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/v2/3528x1985q90/923/hh8Guk.png)",Neutral
AMD,"Raptor Lake isn't getting new games for APO.  Which strikes me as greedy, since I'm sure it would work fine. Intel originally said that APO wouldn't work at all on 13th gen, which turned out to be completely false.",Negative
AMD,"When combined with Nova Lake's bLLC, it could give Intel a major edge over AMD's X3D.       And yeah, limiting it to certain games and certain CPUs is a real downer for the technology, so hopefully Intel can find a way to streamline and expand it when Nova Lake launches.",Positive
AMD,"AFAIK, it's recommended to use Balanced mode for proper use of the efficiency cores if you have a Raptor Lake or Arrow Lake CPU",Neutral
AMD,Balanced in full load will just do the same thing as High Performance.,Neutral
AMD,"It's capable of a few things, but the main mechanism from what I've seen is that it temporarily disables three out of four cores in each E-core cluster by forcing them into the lowest power state. The result is that the remaining active core has access to each cluster's full L2 cache (2MB on 12th-gen, 4MB on 13th/14th-gen). L2 cache isn't shared with P-cores (L3 is global), so this can really minimize E-core cache evictions before they're forced into slower memory, and games do love themselves some cache.  It's a genuinely clever way of maximizing available resources and I really wish they'd allow user control over its features, but it seems to be pretty tightly leashed to/by the team that developed it. It obviously wouldn't benefit every situation, such as particularly low/high thread occupancy situations, but it's pretty rough to have the option tied to quarterly updates for one or two specific games.",Neutral
AMD,Or... Just process lasso.,Neutral
AMD,Because it’s optimizations on how it can efficiently use the cpu.,Neutral
AMD,Must the App be downloaded? Or it's automatic after installing the PPM and DTT drivers?,Neutral
AMD,"All of this stuff is super situational. For when it’s supported for my 14th G, I love it.  To call it better than X3D though? That’s a bit much.",Positive
AMD,They are they came up with ML for their upscaller before the red team did and even better than FSR as a dump upscaler and they also did a good RT implementation. But the hardware still has raw horse power issues and they already use a big die for what it can do.  In the 80's or they shammed The DEC Alpha team on subnormal floating point operations with the 8087 FPU. Intel was doing way more precession without having to round so earlier on a consumer FPU while the Alpha CPU was a Mainframe one. Intel also gave it up to help estandardize the way CPUs handle floating point types.  Intel compilers were also black magic becuase they optimized so much C and C++ for Intel specifically but there was always controversy causeless AMD x86 couldn't take part of those optimizations,Neutral
AMD,Were there any background tasks running when the screenshot was captured ? I want to see how the E-cores are assigned for the background tasks under APO.,Neutral
AMD,In certain games. It's not universal at all. There would be scenarios where it gets an edge but if AMD is pushing as hard as rumors state they may still have the better CPUs overall.,Neutral
AMD,"Great explanation that makes sense!  It definitely has to do with the cache, that much is true.   A Raptor Lake CPU with 8 P cores and no efficiency cores, with 36MB of L3 would perform exceptionally well in games.   But the efficiency cores have their uses as well in highly parallel tasks.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah it's a pretty cool, yet simple idea. It would be really nice to give users more granular control natively.",Positive
AMD,Are the e cores clustered in order so we would be able to manually achieve this with process lasso?,Neutral
AMD,Why should game devs be automatically expected to specifically optimize their game for specific architectures of Intel's CPUs? It's not on them to do so.,Negative
AMD,You need to download the Intel Application Optimization app from the Windows store,Neutral
AMD,"I never said it was better than X3D, only that it is useful as a foil.       Remember that Nova Lake will have bLLC, which is the answer to X3D.  But in conjunction with APO, it may give Intel the edge and help them regain the gaming crown in the next cycle provided they can streamline and expand the technology.",Positive
AMD,"Actually, it is better than X3D in almost every GPU/CPU combo where the GPU throttles. Intel 14th gen almost universally wins 1% lows and frequently FPS - almost universally in 4k gaming, but as I said, when the GPU throttles at any resolution, which is almost always, Intel wins.",Positive
AMD,"Eh, they're very good but they benefited vastly from AMDs mistakes and the lessons learned from it. Remember AMD didn't have any ai hardware for their first 2 gens on RDNA and RDNA 3 didn't have enough for FSR4 either. It's not that intel were better at producing a ML upscaler. They just had the hardware for it from the get go so they could implement it quicker.  They did make Xess though which is miles ahead of FSR 3 even on AMD systems (on average. FSR3 is pretty good when modded and can be competitive) so they do have some extremely talented people there. I hope they fund them properly and don't go the AMD route of having Ryzen and Radeon not work together due to pride.",Positive

AMD,Where to download this APO,Neutral
AMD,Except its THE game devs job to optimize games for multiple cpus and gpus.,Neutral

AMD,AMD also has Heterogeneous CPUs and even more so ARM cpus.  Devs should start to do this optimizations to schedule the stronger cores.,Neutral

AMD,I love Intel but with how the company is doing right now I’m in a “I’ll believe it when I see it” type of skepticism.,Neutral
AMD,"Sorry I am making unreasonable requests. Can you test the game with APO on, and a few background tasks ? Like a few browser tabs, a youtube video playing, discord etc ? I am interested in the E-core usage, particularly the spread of E-core usage.   Thanks.",Neutral
AMD,"You need to enable it in the BIOS, me ale sure the DTT driver is installed and then download the app from the Windows 11 store",Neutral
AMD,"Which they already do, and are often overworked and underappreciated for.   But sure, it's their fault they didn't optimize the game even more for a subset of already relatively high end CPUs....",Negative
AMD,"You are massively oversimplifying. A lot of games that support APO, like Metro Exodus EE OP used as an example, were released before Intel released CPUs with P and E cores. Expecting studios to rework and optimize old games for new CPUs is very naive.",Negative
AMD,"They should be focusing on optimizations that help the vast majority of all CPUs, especially older/lower end ones.   It's not their job to specifically help one companies latest CPU architectures because they couldn't figure out how to create a core that has both good area and performance.",Negative
AMD,That's not simply what APO does.,Neutral

AMD,Thanks a lot.,Positive
AMD,> i am not talking about older games. i am talking about newer games.... really dude?  New games seldom have problems with P and E cores. That is why if you took at minute to look at games that APO support you would notice almost all were released before 2022 before release of Alder lake CPUs. Because older P and E unaware games struggle. Don't really dude me if you are this clueless.,Negative
AMD,"APO includes specific optimizations made for specific Intel skus, not general optimizations that help pretty much all processors.",Neutral
AMD,That is not true whatsoever. Games do not properly utilize the p and e cores and unreal 5 is very known for this.,Negative
AMD,Ok…? If there is a specific problem then they need to optimize it for that hardware. Literally a devs job. Still don’t get your thought process,Negative
AMD,"Dude, Unreal 5 runs like crap on pretty much all hardware. It stutters on AMD and nVidia graphics. Unreal 5 doesn't count.",Negative
AMD,"There isn't a specific problem, it still works lol, just not as well as it could on a specific architecture.   They shouldn't be wasting their finite resources/time on optimizing specifically for an already relatively high end and well performing architecture, but rather attempting more generalized optimizations that help all users.   It really shouldn't be too hard to understand.",Negative
AMD,"Very cool. Cheers Intel! As a 6900XT owner, I use Xess whenever it's available. The DP4A version got very solid once V1.3 hit.  Hopefully more devs implement it.",Positive
AMD,"I like how Intel still support DP4A model. My meteor lake chip gonna love this XeSS2 with FG and LL.  Meanwhile Amd give middle finger to their consumer who don't have radeon 9000 series, FSR4 doesn't works at all on their previous GPU including the flagship rx 7000 series.",Positive

AMD,"I don't want to defend AMD, but 7000 series lacks the FP8 instruction to hardware accelerate FSR4.

AMD,"I mean it gives better image quality than FSR 3.1, so I know I definitely do.",Positive
AMD,Sure. The image quality is generally better. I'd only use FSR if I was trying to squeeze every last drop of performance out of my GPU since it's faster than Xess DP4a. But Xess will be tried first.,Positive
AMD,Do you have a link? Anything I have seen points to the GPU using Xess DP4A unless it's an ARC GPU. So it supports RDNA2 and newer on AMD and Turing and newer on Nvidia.  https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-xess-compatibility-nvidia-amd/  And I do literally run Xess on my 6900XT (currently using it for F7 Rebirth through Optiscaler). So if I'm not running Xess DP4a then what am I running?,Neutral
AMD,">I don't want to defend AMD, but 7000 series lacks the FP8 instruction to hardware accelerate FSR4   Sure, but they can make FSR4 for non hardware accelerated like Intel right?

AMD,where did amd touch you bud?,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah more and more games are adding DLSS support, so I'm not sure when I would need Xess",Neutral
AMD,"That's true but in edge cases where even the lightest Xess option is still too heavy, FSR may still deliver a better overall experience.   E.g. CP2077 on the steam Deck in Dog Town. When I was testing some stuff out (trying to see how close I could get my Deck to the Switch 2 build) I found Xess to be a unsuitable. Even on the lightest Xess mode, the performance hit was a bit too noticeable. FSR doesn't look as good as Xess but it runs better and you can get away with a bit more upscaling artifacting on the Decks relatively small screen. Just rendering at a lower res and letting the screen upscale was also a solid option in that scenario.  As I say though, that's an edge case where you really just need outright speed. If your GPU doesn't support DLSS or FSR4 then using Xess makes sense in the vast majority of cases.",Neutral
AMD,Are you sure you're not getting the DP4A/Shader Model 6.4 and Arc exclusive version mixed up? DP4a was added to Shader Model 6.4. https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki/Shader-Model-6.4.  There is a separate path of Xess that is better than DP4A but that only works on Arc Cards.,Neutral
AMD,"It's good to see finally Intel working with game developer to bring optimization to Intel platform. This time not only optimization for Arc GPU, but also for Intel Core CPU like proper CPU scheduling for P and E cores to make sure the game runs on the right thread.

AMD,Most likely the bLLC variant wil be single compute tile and single cache tile as this would be cheaper for now than putting bLLC cache in base tile like Amd did. They can do that when 18A-PT is avaliable which will probably be after Nova Lake goes into production with 18A or maybe 18A-P,Neutral

AMD,fym no different they're 50% faster,Negative
AMD,No. ARL architecture is definitely not optimized for latency but hiding memory access which favours multithreading instead of gaming. Hopefully Nova Lake will optimize all the latecy issues with ARL arch and decrease latency to L3 considerably aswell,Negative
AMD,"Yes, but in games, it's the P-cores that are meant to be utilized. Also, more than eight cores or 16 threads aren't really necessary for gaming. The 9950x3d isn't faster, than the 9900x3d.  My point is that the space taken up by the E-cores could instead be used for additional cache, not?",Neutral
AMD,I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it. Anyhow if that's true the large L3 should be even more helpful for things like gaming as it will keep those higher latency hits down. AMD has always had higher latency due to the same kind of design with a separate memory controller so we have pretty good data on how extra cache can help.,Neutral

AMD,Process lasso can let you just designate by task so the E cores can do background and side jobs. People use process lasso on the 7950x3d to make the X3D chiplet run games with those 8 cores and the other 8 core chiplet for everything else.,Neutral
AMD,What issue did you run into with a 9800x3d? It has one CCD and no small cores,Neutral
AMD,"Nowadays there are very few cases where disabling E cores is extremely beneficial, sometimes they are a detriment to performance but more often than not they are useful. Not to mention the E core design team is more competent than the P core team and are quickly catching up in performance.    The E cores in Alder Lake had relatively poor ST performance but in Arrow Lake they are much faster and closer to the P cores in raw performance. Every new generation the gap keeps shrinking and it will make the disabling of E cores less and less relevant.    Sometimes the Windows scheduler will wrongly assign an E core to a ST bound task, even if a P core is available, but it doesn't happen often enough to be a serious issue.",Neutral
AMD,"yes, but not because of windows scheduling - its because you can OC higher with them off - better temps and easier stability - some people disable HT for the same.",Neutral
AMD,They don't pay attention,Negative
AMD,"No. Intel needs to do what Amd did and add seperate bLLC just for gaming. As long as latency is reduced to the L3 cache including bLLC, gaming performance will definitely increase as 285K and 9950x have similar performance in both gaming and productivity with small lead going to Amd. But x3d totally dominates ARL beacsue of the obvious huge cache difference and lower overall latency to their cache implementation.",Neutral

AMD,"There was one article a while back that reported something like ""intel goes back to integrated mc"", not understanding that panther lake is a fundamentally different product than the tile based desktop products.",Neutral

AMD,">I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it.  I'm curious, which leakers have said otherwise?

I expect with CAMM2 that max ram capaciity will go for 512GB and maybe 1TB for Nova Lake aswell. Even with 2 channel, cudimm will go above 10,000 MTS and maybe 12000 if we are lucky on CAMM2 modules by 2027 as CAMM2 definitely being used for DDR6   I do feel Intel has I/O advantage beyong gaming and that market is getting bigger than hardcore gamers all the time!!

AMD,"I don't recall Intel stating that NVL core chips would be at TSMC, only that some of the eventual package would be... which implies iGPU, to me, and that wouldn't be N2 (possibly N4, since Battlemage is N5, and N4 would be open and cheaper than N3 nodes).  Do you have a source, where they directly claim the NVL cores are coming from TSMC?",Neutral
AMD,"The game is a dumpster fire when it comes to CPU utilization, it hammers even top tier gaming chips like the 9800X3D. I'm not surprised if the E cores can bottleneck the performance even further, most likely some of the game's heaviest threads get (wrongly) assigned to the E cores.    The scheduling in W11 has been significantly improved over the last few years but it's not 100% perfect either. Legacy software in particular, which typically utilizes 1 core, often ends up running in an E core and as a result you can't take advantage of the higher ST performance a P core provides. In that case you need stuff like Process Lasso to fix the problem. It doesn't happen very often but when it does it's very annoying.",Negative

AMD,Is anyone left?,Neutral
AMD,"Wonder what node such a product, if it does exist, would use for the iGPU tile.   AFAIK, rumor is that the iGPU tile for the standard parts would be on 18A or an 18A variant. However, if this is a flagship part, I would assume they would be willing to pay the extra cost to use N2...   However that would also presumably involve porting the architecture over to another node, which I don't think Intel has the resources, or wants to go through the effort, to do so.   Also wonder if such a product will finally utilize the ADM cache that has been rumored since like, forever.   And this is a bit of a tangent, but I swear at this point in the leak cycle for a new Intel product, there's always usually a ton of different skus that are leaked that may or may not launch - right now we have NVL bLLC, NVL standard, and now this, and a bunch of them end up not launching (whether they were cut internally, or the leaks were just made up). So it would be pretty interesting to see if any of the more specialized rumored NVL skus end up actually launching.",Neutral

AMD,"The low volume part of that quote is important. If you're making heaps of them, each can take up a little bit of the startup costs for that design. If you only make a few, those costs get concentrated on what you do make.  Low volume also means a single defect is promotionally more of your possible units, and hits the margins harder. You do get more total defects in a larger run, but at sufficiently high quantities of those defects, you start making lower bins to recover some of the defects. If you hardly make the volume to cover one widespread SKU, you aren't likely to have enough to make a cheaper one with any degree of availability.

AMD,I mean 9800x3D and 14900K offers basically the same performance in the enthusiast segment. Going forward though it would be nice to have more cache so normal users doesn't have to do any sort of memory overclocking just to match 9000x3D in gaming.,Neutral
AMD,4070 ti won’t cut it man - upgrade!,Negative
AMD,Broadwell could have been so interesting had it planned out.,Positive
AMD,"I want a 32 Core/64 Thread 3.40 GHz Core i9-like CPU. Not Xeon like with Quad-Channel and stuff, just 40 PCIe 5.0 lanes and 32 Power-Cores instead of little.big design. 😬",Neutral
AMD,">Otherwise AMD will see a clear opportunity to bring prices up  AMD already did, as you can see zen 5 x3d is overpriced as hell especially the 8 core CPU. Zen 5 is overpriced compared to zen 4 which is already more expensive than zen 3. Not to mention they did shady business like keep doing rebranding old chip as the new series to fools people into thinking it was new architecture when it wasn't and sell it with higher price compared to chip on the same architecture in old gen.  Intel surely needed to kick Amd ass because Amd keep milking people with the same 6 and 8 cores CPU over and over with price increases too! Not to mention radeon is the same by following nvidia greedy strategy.  Edit: Some mad Amd crowd going to my history just to downvote every of my comments because they are salty as hell, i won't be surprised if there are from trash sub r/hardware. But truth to be told, your downvote won't change anything!!",Negative
AMD,"Even though it's not stacked, I believe it's still going to fix the last level cache latency issue MTL and ARL have.   Ryzen CPUs have lower L3 latency than Intel because each CCX gets their own independent L3, unlike Intel's shared L3. Now in NVL, the BLLC configuration will replace half of the P-core and E-core tiles with L3, so possibly giving the existing cores/tiles their own independent L3, improving latency and bandwidth over shared L3.  But one thing intrigues me. If this cache level has lower latency than shared L3, wouldn't this more properly be called L2.5 or something below L3 rather than last level cache? Will NVL even still have shared L3 like the previous Intel CPUs? I know the rumor that it will have shared L2 per two cores, but we know nothing of the L3 configuration.",Neutral
AMD,"> On one hand, this shouldn't cause any thermal and Fmax implications like 3D stacking has created for AMD's chips, however doing this would prob also make the latency hit of increasing L3 capacity worse too.  It is already a non-issue since AMD moved the 3D V-Cache to underneath the compute tile.",Neutral
AMD,"Adamantaium was on the interposer, did they change plans?",Neutral
AMD,"Don't remember them saying anything like that, but by around that time their 18A packaging is supposed to be ready for 3D stacking.",Neutral
AMD,"Nova lake= skip of it's just as good as zen, you would be looking at 2 gens after that and then swap from AM5 to intel.",Positive
AMD,"> If a 4+8-core Ultra 3 425K can match an 8+0 core Ryzen AI 5 competing product in gaming  Doubt that since it'll probably lack hyperthreading and the E-Cores are slower, even 6C12T CPUs are starting to hit their limits in games in the last few years, faster cores won't help if there's much less resources to go around, it kinda feels like intel went backwards when they removed hyperthreading without increasing the P-Core count.",Negative
AMD,Intel managed to run Sandy Bridge's ring bus clock speeds at core clocks which resulted in 30 cycles of L3 latency.   Haswell disaggreated core and ring clocks allowing for additional power savings.   Arrow Lake's L3 latency is 80 cycles with a ring speed of 3.8ghz,Neutral
AMD,"I'd like to see the HEDT X-series come back too, but Intel would have to come up with something that would be competitive in that area.  It's not hard to see why Intel dropped the series when you take a look at the Sapphire Rapids Xeon-W lineup they would have likely been based off of.  I think AMD would also do well to offer something that's a step above the Ryzen lineup, rather than a leap above it like the current Threadrippers.",Neutral
AMD,Well it was a downgrade on system snappiness as intel have way higher random reads than amd.,Neutral
AMD,> I mean 9800x3D and 14900K offers basically the same performance  LMAO,Neutral
AMD,"Huh? 9800x3d is universally known to be like 20-25 percent faster, even in 1 percent lows.   https://www.techspot.com/review/2931-amd-ryzen-9800x3d-vs-intel-core-14900k/",Neutral
AMD,Maybe that is your experience.  Neverthelesss if you compare most gamers who switched to 9800x3D they report a significantly noticeable uplift in fps and 0.1 fps. Maybe a negligible few reported a decrease. And this has very likely nothing to do with the x3D CPU but other causes.,Neutral
AMD,"Ah you’re missing the final piece. As far as i’m aware this pretty much requires controlling the OS as well (or at least solid OS support). Consoles get their own custom operating system, Apple built a new version of MacOS for M chips. Intel and AMD though don’t control windows.",Neutral
AMD,UMA is such a hassle That's why I don't see it much except for calculation purposes (HPC/AI)...,Negative
AMD,"Application developers are supposed to try to avoid copies from GPU memory to CPU memory, instead letting it stay in the GPU memory as much as possible",Neutral
AMD,">so there is still the cost of useless copies between system RAM vs allocated GPU ram.    There is none, AMDGPU drivers have supported GTT memory since forever, so static allocation part is just to reduce burden for app developers but if you use GTT memory you can do zero-copy CPU+GPU hybrid processing.",Negative
AMD,"Intel needs something decent because AMD has taken a page out of intel (up to gen7) playbook, same cores no changes. Intel now provides more cores but it's the 100% core increase Vs AMD 50% and bLLC that should shake things up, hopefully they keep the temperature down as I don't want to have to replace case and get a 360mm rad just to not throttle, and not ever again do a 13th and 14th gen degradation show.   If all goes well going back to intel for a few years then AMD, brand loyalty is for suckers, buy what's best for performance and value. Hopefully intel i5 has 12P cores and i7 18-20P cores that would be nice to have",Neutral
AMD,"bLLC is just a big-ass L3$ and since Intel does equal L3 slices per coherent ring stop, it'll be 6\*12 or 12\*12 with each slice doubling or quadrupling. The rumor is 144MB so quadrupled per slice, probably 2x ways and 2x sets to keep L3 latency under control.",Neutral
AMD,"Intel and AMD have effectively the same client L3 strategy. It's only allocated local to one compute die. Intel just doesn't have any multi-compute die parts till NVL.   > Now in NVL, the BLLC configuration will replace half of the P-core and E-core tiles with L3  8+16 is one tile, in regardless of how much cache they attach to it",Neutral
AMD,It is a massive issue for amd. You're voltage limited like crazy as electron migration kills the 3D cache really fucking fast. 1.3V is already dangerous voltage for the cache.,Negative
AMD,"I still think there's a slight impact (the 9800x3d only boosts up to 5.2GHz vs the 5.5GHz of the 9700x), but compared to Zen 4, the issue does seem to have been lessened, yes.   And even with Zen 4, the Fmax benefit from not using 3D V-cache using comparable skus was also only single digits anyways.",Neutral
AMD,"Adamantium was always rumored to be an additional L4 cache IIRC, and what Intel appears to be doing with NVL is just adding more L3 (even though ig Intel is calling their old L3 the new L4 cache? lol).   I don't think Intel can also build out Foveros-Direct at scale just yet, considering they are having problems launching it for just CLF too.",Neutral
AMD,Zen6 is the last AMD CPU using its socket anyway,Neutral
AMD,"I'm an e-core hater but arrow lake e-cores are really performant and make up for the loss of HT. arl/nvl 4+8 would wildly beat 6c12t adl/rpl.  HT was always a fallacy anyway. If you load up every thread, your best possible performance is ~60% of a core for a games main-thread.  I would much rather pin main-thread to best p-core in a dedicated fashion and let the other cores handle sub threads. Much better 1% lows if we optimize for arrow lake properly (still doesn't hold a candle to 9800X3D with HT disabled though).",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, I somewhat agree with this. I suppose it depends if Intel’s latency problem with their P+E core design is at all a fixable one - 4c/8t is still shockingly serviceable for gaming, but 4c/4t absolutely is not.",Neutral
AMD,It's the same ratio as 285K 8P+16E vs AMD 16P and we know that 285K is competitive despite no hyperthreading,Neutral
AMD,"Sooo a few months ago, I helped a buddy of mine troubleshoot a black screen issue on his newly built 9800X3D and RTX 5090 rig, a fairly common issue with Nvidia’s latest GPUs.  While working on his PC, I'd notice a series of odd and random hiccups. For example, double clicking a window to maximize it would cause micro freezes. His monitor runs at 240Hz, and the cursor moves very smoothly, but dragging a window around felt like it was refreshing at 60Hz. Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.  I did my due diligence on his AMD setup: updated the BIOS and chipset drivers, enabled EXPO profile, made sure Game Bar was enabled, set the power mode to Balanced. Basically, all the little things you need to do to get the X3D chip to play nice and left.  But man... I do not want to ever be on an AMD system.",Neutral
AMD,did they measure responsiveness and timed the click to action? and was it significantly different? how much difference are we talking about?,Neutral
AMD,"can you explain exactly what you're talking about here? are you talking about a situation where the system needs to do random reads from an ssd? aka: boot time, initial game load time?",Neutral
AMD,"How was ""system snappiness"" measured?",Neutral
AMD,No.,Neutral
AMD,"Now both AMD and Intel chips are “disaggregated “ which means between cpu and other agents like memory controllers, pcie, and storage there is higher latency than the 12/13/14th gen parts. AMD has higher latency due to the larger distances involved on the package.  Also Intel is not really improving the CPU core much. There won’t be a compelling reason to upgrade from a 14700 until DDR6 comes out. At least not in desktop. Nova lake high cache parts will cost $600 or more so value/dollar will be low.",Negative
AMD,So? Major upgrade for everything else,Neutral
AMD,"I had an 12600 not k. I had the opposite experience, I upgraded to a 7800x3d and the snappiness was a night and day upgrade. I can recommend a x3d to anyone. Pair that cpu with Windows 11 IoT LTSC and you have a winner <3",Neutral
AMD,"Meant to say ""Gaming Performance""  >Higher avg on X3D  >similar or same 1% lows on both platforms >Higher .1% lows on Intel.",Neutral
AMD,"any comment that starts with ""I mean..""  I never go any further, its like some weird reddit think where everyone with ignorant comments seems to start out with this,  at least often anyway.",Negative
AMD,"""Enthusiast Segment"" my good sir. All the benches you see are poorly configured or stock 14900K. With tuning it's a different story. Intel craptorlake scales with fast ram.",Neutral
AMD,"As a long time AMD user I know that Intel needs to be tuned to perform best. So when you tune the 14900K or even 285K you get like 20% performance uplift vs stock. X3D just performs great out of the box because of the huge L3 Cache. At the very least if you do not like microstutters or frame drops and want consistent gaming performance Intel 14th gen is superior vs current AMD's offering. Anyone with a specific board like Apex, Lightning, Tachyon, or even Gigabyte Refresh boards + i7/i9 13-14th gen with decent memory controller can achieve similar gaming experience. I'm speaking from experience since I also have a fully tuned 9950x3D/5090 on my testbench. For productivity task Intel feels much better to use as well. I feel like Intel is just better optimized for Windows and Productivity too.",Positive
AMD,"Actually Intel thermal is already better than Amd ever since Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake released. Even Core Ultra 7 258V is arround 10c cooler than Amd Z2E and Strix Point on the same watt.   On MSI Claw 8 AI+, Lunar Lake temp at 20w is just arround 62c while the Amd version is arround 70c. I wouldn't have a doubt Nova Lake and Panther Lake will also have good thermal because it will have 18A node with BPD and RibbonFET GAA which is more advance than traditional silicon when it comes to power delivery and efficiency.",Positive
AMD,Ah so bLLC on both tiles is a possible configuration? Any chance Intel actually goes for this?,Neutral
AMD,You can very simply get 9800x3D to 5.4 with little effort,Neutral
AMD,"No, they will do zen7 too",Neutral

AMD,That (Apple Silicon is good) and UMA are different stories I already know that Apple Silicon is good,Positive
AMD,On which benchmark(s) / metrics?,Neutral
AMD,"Haven't kept up with mobile since AMD 5000 and intel 10th gen, all I remember is intel needing XTU undervolting and then intel blocking XTU so using third party undervolt programs, AMD like I said 5000 never needed undervolting.   Desktop side, AMD 7000 is a hot mess, like seriously ridiculous. Seems that was sorted on 9000,    Let's wait and see on nova lake and zen6, like I said, brand loyalty is stupid, bought into AM5, so it's cheaper for me to go for zen6 with 244Mb of L3, but no am6-7 that will be intel.",Negative
AMD,"In theory, yes. For packaging reasons and market segmentation, probably not.",Neutral
AMD,"what's that on in terms of percentage, or seconds to person? was it noticeable?  i'm not techy enough, but is random reads and writes for clicking things and accessing data, and less so on copying and pasting a file?",Neutral
AMD,where is this whitepaper,Neutral
AMD,"You can send white papers all day but if most people buy these for gaming or productivity, AMD is winning in both categories.",Negative
AMD,Stock clocks 5.7/4.4/5.0 HT Off With DDR5 7600-8000 on Windows 10 22H2 or Windows 11 23H2 is enough to match 9800x3D at 5.4ghz with 6000 c28/6200 c28,Neutral
AMD,So MLID leaked in his most recent video about this (and he ranks it with a blue color code - 'very high confidence')  What do you think about this?,Neutral
AMD,[https://youtu.be/0dOjvdOOq04?t=283](https://youtu.be/0dOjvdOOq04?t=283) This explains it.  Gonna find the whitepapers link again.,Neutral
AMD,Based on what evidence?   I looked online for a few moments and found:  (1) Buildzoid from actually hardcore  overlocking did a 12 hour live stream where they couldn't even get a 8000 mhz overclock stable on the 14900k. No wonder why people haven't benched this lol  https://www.youtube.com/live/bCis9x_2IL0?si=ht3obVoBLcRFCyXI  (2) Plenty of benchmarks where an overclocked 9800x3d is about 10 percent faster than an overclocked 14900k with 7600 ddr5,Neutral
AMD,"Haven't you been listening? The conversation is strange (Confused) You first brought up the story of UMA, right?",Neutral
AMD,"Be civil and follow Reddiquette, uncivil language, slurs and insults will result in a ban.",Neutral
AMD,"That channel has a lot of videos and even on this specific video it would help if you point the specific time you're referring to.  Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.  So by virtue of their fast memory Macs are easily 3x to 8x faster than PC on LLMs.  The rest is quite different though which is why what benchmark is important.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm highly suspicious, for packaging reasons if nothing else. I'm not going to call it impossible, but that would put enormous strain on the X dimension. Think about it, it's something on the order of 3-4x what the socket was originally for.  And obviously goes without saying, but MLID ""very high confidence"" doesn't mean shit.",Negative
AMD,"Based on my own testing , the games I play and benchmark results. Bullzoid is not relevant to this conversation. You can keep downvoting me for speaking the truth it's okay. I can't blame you because youtube and mainstream techspot are 99% misinformation. If you believe 9800x3D is 30% faster then go buy it, nobody is stopping you. I have investments with AMD and you're doing me a favor by supporting them.",Neutral
AMD,Just to be clear compute and hardware support for things like tensor cores have a massive impact. HBM is king but on older cards like the mi100 (released five years ago) can be out paced by a mid range card like the 4070.  All I wanted to convey is llm and token generation is a complex topic with limitations and struggles beyond memory bandwidth.,Neutral
AMD,"I haven't downvoted you at all, what are you even talking about.   You want people to believe in some conspiracy theory where any other information is a lie, and only you provide the ""real truth"".",Negative
AMD,"Besides, UMA wasn't first developed by Apple. Even if Intel introduces it, the software side or the software framework… Moreover, the OS side has to deal with it, so it is necessary to consider it a little. That's what you said earlier",Neutral
AMD,"I take no side there. I'm a dev, I want my code to be the fastest on all platforms  I have: - M4 Max so I can optimize on ARM and MacOS - Ryzen 9950X so I can optimize with AVX512 - in the process of buying an Intel 265K so I can tune multithreaded code to heterogeneous architecture.  The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough. So I expect the next-gen CPUs (Zen 6 and Nova Lake) to be quad-channel by default (~200GB/s with DDR5) so they are at least in the same ballpark as M4 chip (but still 2x slower than M4 Pro and Max).  I also expect more soldered LPDDR5 builds in the coming year.",Neutral
AMD,"Have you not seen HardwareUnboxed 9070 XT Finewine video? Tell me why should I trust someone like that? I'm just sayin if you want real information test it yourself. I just don't trust product influencers like GamersNexus, HUB , Jayz2cents and other mainstream channels. Id rather buy the product and test it myself. Im not forcing you to believe what I said, its for people that actually knows what Raptorlake is capable off. If you want to see a properly tuned 14900k check out facegamefps on youtube. This is a very capable platform.",Neutral
