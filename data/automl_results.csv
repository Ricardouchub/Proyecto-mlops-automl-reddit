OEMs aren't gonna like you taking a profit on RAM as a middleman when taking profit on RAM is one of their key revenue sources on laptop upsells. So you sell the RAM for cost, meaning you charge $350 for the SoC.  Yes, you've made the same nominal profit of $150, but your margin % dropped from 50% to ~43% *and* this simple math example doesn't take into account that there is a cost involved with having to source the memory yourself (i.e pay staff to manage contracts, make and track orders, receive shipments, package the RAM, etc.)  That's why it's very difficult for on-package memory to gain traction in the Windows PC world: Most CPU makers don't want to take the margin hit, and most OEMs would prefer to just handle memory quantity and product tiering themselves.",Neutral
Intel,"Nope, that's why lunar lake is a one time thing, it's too expensive and has little flexibility",Negative

Intel,"But think of what range the Panther Lake platform covers. The B390 is the top end. You have essentially the same platform support down to the 4Xe entry GPU. So yeah, maybe dual channel is not quite ideal at the far end of the distribution, but you need to compromise somewhere.    If they went for 256b, they'd really need a significantly bigger GPU to justify it.

Intel,"Fabulously stupid, but not without precedent. I’m pretty sure “Nuclear Laptops” has covered at least one laptop that supported dual channel but the manufacturer only soldered a single channel without even an empty DIMM slot for the other channel.

Intel,"> lpddr = soldered  Not with LPCAMM, but they haven't yet proposed a single channel module. Definitely not impossible though, and may even be likely.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, that would be the ideal. The current process has both the memory and SoC attached at once. If you could separate out those two steps, then you could have the customer source the memory, and problem solved.  And this isn't some pie-in-the-sky fantasy either. Would require some packaging innovation, sure, but I don't think anyone seriously questions the feasibility at a conceptual level.

Intel,That's a good price for a Helios you linked... don't expect the 2026 refresh of it to be priced the same when it replaces that model in a few months.   XPS 14 *is* very expensive. But that's always been the case for the XPS. They've always been expensive given their performance level. But you do get some of the best build quality available on a Windows machine in exchange.,Positive
Intel,"This is just how the Windows laptop market is. MSRP on new laptops are high, while last gen are on sale, it's always like this I'm guessing you forget that AMD once marketed Mendocino as being in up to $700 laptops.. B390 laptops will start at around $1100, but I expect that to decrease after companies get their premium lineups out and then do more budget models.  Like you can find Lunar Lake for $500-$600 new these days if you wait for sales and aren't picky about other aspects.  Anyways, yes you can get a stronger GPU laptop for not much more, but those dGPU laptops will eat through battery like no other, so I wouldn't even consider them a direct competition.",Neutral
Intel,People aren't buying these for price alone.,Neutral
Intel,"I saw this yesterday as well... The edge is dead on arrival at these prices. At those prices, I'd rather get HP zbook with strix halo.",Negative
Intel,"It means less of the fixed function units in the render slice, which IIRC is rasterisers and ROPs. Compared to 3x4 it'll be less performant, but also smaller and less power hungry. More generally the ratio of compute to fixed function depends on the complexity of the shading - coarsely, low settings at high resolution would prefer more fixed function, high settings at lower resolution prefer more compute",Neutral
Intel,"It pretty much matches 60w version of 4050 which is good result for an iGPU, it gets beaten handily by 90w but considering the form factor of devices B390 can be used in, the most relevant comparison is to the 60 and 30w version.",Positive
Intel,"It depends on the TDP chosen, as we see in other reviews as at around 35W it's even and under that Strix Halo chokes itself. No point putting Strix Halo in most laptops or handhelds at its cost and power curve. Desktop replacements/workstation, absolutely but if you want to play games on battery you might as well just use PTL.",Neutral
Intel,What's that supposed to prove? Obviously a chip with way more transistors is going to perform better.,Neutral
Intel,"That's significantly better pricing but by a 65w charger suggests, its a lower-powered X7 chip. Not the full power used in the XPS 14, which comes with 100w charger  Probably 25w tdp. Instead of 45 tdp.",Neutral
Intel,"To be completely fair: 4050 laptops don't use 300W power bricks. It's a 50W GPU typically, I think the very highest power limit I have seen for one of those is 65W.  It's fair criticism though, you can absolutely squeeze this type of GPU into most ultrabooks if desired though and a 50 tier chip used to be a common inclusion in ultrabook machines with reasonable power requirements.",Neutral
Intel,Why do people think the G14 is some chonky laptop? It's similar to a MacBook Pro is terms of weight and size.  And it has all day battery life as well.,Neutral
Intel,"Different classes of machines each putting their budgets into different things. XPS 14 is basically the most expensive Windows Thin and Light, but it's also *the* standard (on Windows). That budget is going into materials and build quality.

Not sure how many budget models with B390 will be there, and price might as well go up (for basically every laptop) due to RAM and SSD becoming significantly more expensive over the year.",Neutral
Intel,There’s a 1300 MSI model. The other models pricing is likely because they’re extra premium laptops that OEMs typically ship new chips in first to jack up prices,Neutral
Intel,"It does not lol LMAO.   It will get no where close to a 60w 4050, with its puny 12 low powered xe3 cores, the 8060s with its massive gpu die and high tdp is still 13% slower than a 4060 laptop in 20+ game average tested by Jarrod’s tech.    Watch when the real gaming benchmarks come, it’s good for an iGPU but no where close to a 4050.",Negative
Intel,Also looking at Geekerwan's testing I would be veeeery interested in seeing how this thing does in a handheld with like 15w for the full SoC. The numbers they were getting at 10w on the GPU were kind of insane.,Positive
Intel,"XPS 14 is likely using the 100W charger for faster charging times, not to accommodate higher TDPs.",Neutral
Intel,"Ptl doesn't need more than 45w at most, perf gains after 30w are low. The difference is just core count, GPU is the same. I'd argue more cores for a regular person doesn't matter much.",Neutral
Intel,"Probably, but that's what PTL is specified at. 25W TDP and 65-80W power cap. The B390 that everyone wants out of these should perform basically the same here. You don't need a 388H to have that GPU. One thing I'll admit I didn't notice before, and that may hurt it slightly, is that the RAM is running at 8533 instead of the full 9600mt/s.",Neutral
Intel,No that seems to be just about enough power considering that the full power draw of a CES display unit used to test games by reviewers drew 60 watts.,Neutral
Intel,"65W seems right, they noted 60W total system draw when testing it in games at CES on one machine.   The X9 only seems to have +100MHz clock speed over the X7, everything else seems the same.",Neutral
Intel,Funny thing is a lot of laptops now come with power bricks much stronger than the laptop actually needs and this is because its used for fast charging.,Neutral
Intel,"What will you do when you run out of 6GB VRAM though? Not to mention that when gaming, a laptop with it will typically have to dissipate twice as much power as Panther Lake.  Either way, the 300 W power brick comes with the 5070 Ti Laptops that the OP is comparing against.",Neutral
Intel,"Well that thing is also expensive, only a bit less than the Dell XPS. We are talking about devices like the MSI Prestige that is like $1300.",Negative
Intel,"It definitely doesn’t have all day battery life, and I doubt the PTL+dGPU model won’t have drawbacks the normal PTL models don’t in battery life",Negative
Intel,Walk into an office or university and see how many people pay $1400+ for gtx 1050 perf.   Not everyone wants the performance if they can get other things.,Negative
Intel,So you want it to be sold for 400 dollars?,Neutral
Intel,"You're comparing an iGPU to a dGPU. These are in completely different categories and they do not compete directly with each other. These devices are literally in different classes and are aimed at different customers.  Panther Lake can be paired with a dGPU too, but for anyone who does not want that, this iGPU is simply phenomenal.",Neutral
Intel,How is battery life on those ~$1k 5050 laptops and how much do they weight?,Neutral
Intel,"Students are extremely likely to make poor financial decisions, yes. Theres a reason so many predatory loan agencies have offices on campuses.",Negative
Intel,"Depends on the college. I find my university to be basically just that, though it’s typically less students being strapped and more parents being strapped with cash",Neutral
Intel,Dude go to uni or office and see the laptops people using. G14 is not it. Too big and fat,Negative
Intel,What are you on about? there are gaming benchmarks in that review... difference between B390 and 4050 60w is 9%,Negative
Intel,The real gaming benchmarks are saying exactly this: that it’s only slightly behind a 60 watt 4050,Neutral
Intel,The 8060s is much slower than this iGPU.,Negative
Intel,"The G14 is 1.57 KG and a 1.59 \~ 1.83 cm  Are you like studying with kids?  For reference, the MacBook Pro 16 is 2.14 KG and 1.68 cm thick and Macbook Pro 14 is 1.55-1.62 KG and 1.55 cm thick",Neutral
Intel,"Guy did an actual test.   https://youtu.be/jrygnUnBRNI  Skip to 12:40  Performs like a full wattage 3050, LIKE I SAID BEFORE. Or a heavily gimped 30w 4050, but anything remotely close to a full wattage 4050 it is majorly behind.",Neutral
Intel,"The 8060s is MUCH FASTER than the b390 lol, what are you on about, some people are so confident in being wrong.",Negative
Intel,"Whatever you're right, Intel should drop pantherlake to 1k. G14 is a slim & sleek design. Honestly dont even know why its not more widly used in offices & univerties",Neutral
Intel,"B390 laptops will start at around $1100, but I expect that to decrease after companies get their premium lineups out and then do more budget models.  Can you give me a link (review will be fine) to ~3lb/sub 1.5kg laptop with full, +100W 4050 that performs on par with desktop 3060?",Neutral
Intel,"> Intel should drop pantherlake to 1k.  Intel isn't making the laptops, they're making the chips.  OEMs have decided to debut them in their premium, thin and light flag ships + a price increase from RAM shortage",Neutral
Intel,"4050 is 3 years old now, there’s not many laptops with that gpu anymore on sale.   But the 4050 at max wattage was only around 10% slower  than a 3060 12gb desktop gpu, which is also reflected in their benchmark scores.   Theres now Lenovo’s yoga pro 9i with a full wattage 5050, which is even faster than the 4050 and performs slightly slower than a 4060 desktop, it’s a thin and light premium laptop lol, is light years faster than a b390 iGPU.",Neutral
Intel,It makes sense to debut in premium models for oems. Cant complain if there's consumers willing to buy them.,Positive
Intel,"> Theres now Lenovo’s yoga pro 9i with a full wattage 5050 [...] it’s a thin and light premium laptop lol  In what world is 4.5lbs light compared to 2.5-3lbs laptops with PTL? That's not even including power brick, which adds at least 1lb.  You could've chosen something like ASUS Tuf A14, but in most cases battery life will be significantly worse, despite bigger battery. Oh, and it will be loud under load.  It's also just under $2k now, so pretty big difference.  It might be a surprise for you, but what many people want from those igpus is the most performance at certain form factor while at the same time being efficient enough to last whole day (or like 7-8 hours) not having to go to every battery saving setting possible.",Neutral
Intel,"it's very cool how optimized that game will be i think, especially for 2026 with all the components shortages",Positive
Intel,Every gaming dev should target the B390 as the 1080p 60fps on medium/low tbh,Neutral
Intel,It seems odd that the Arc B390 was listed as the minimum required IGPU when the much weaker discrete Arc A380 is also on there. I'm sure most of the last generation IGPUs like the Radeon 880M or 890M are also powerful enough (considering they are faster than the Arc A380).  We've always known that the Forza Horizon games are very well optimized and are able to run on IGPUs just fine. Keep in mind that Forza Horizon 5 runs just fine on the Vega 3 IGPU in the 7 year old AMD Athlon 3000G.  The article is presenting the trivial fact that the B390 is listed as the minimum spec for the upcoming Forza Horizon 6 as somehow being a huge win for Intel. That's not very good journalism. It was going to run on IGPUs regardless of whether or not the B390 existed.,Neutral
Intel,Wonder how many wafer starts per month Fab 52 is up to now. Seems 18A parts are going to sell well and they have several more coming. Hope they can keep up.,Positive
Intel,"Pricing is not one of those ""victories""",Negative
Intel,"Unfortunately it's likely the B390 will be priced closer to Strix Halo than to Strix Point. Which is awkward since Intel only compares it to Strix Point if their presentations, not to Strix Halo.",Negative
Intel,Any game that has to run on a Series S will consequently have very low minimum system requirements.,Negative
Intel,Low minimum system requirements were never a guarantee that a game would perform decently. Especially when they don't even list the resolution and framerate they're targeting.,Negative
Intel,"Gives me hope that the Fable reboot will be well optimized. Just hoping playground games nails the story, gameplay and charm that we love with the series.",Positive
Intel,Do you all forget how raw Forza Horizon 5 seemed when it came out despite having relatively low system requirements? Low system requirements != good optimisation.,Neutral
Intel,"except you, unreal engine",Negative
Intel,"Yeah, it feels a bit like marketing and there have been a few of those.  Right now pretty much any computer with the X9 or X7 is expensive. You can find 5050 laptops for the same price. This chipset isn’t going to do that well unless it can be found at a decent price.   Also buyers should be careful because not every laptop presented has the power and thermals set to permit full power sustained boosting at the wattages tested in the reviews.   Those laptops should get cheaper and so on of course. Right now we don’t know. A Dell XPS costs more than a new mid-range MacBook Pro though, that is steep.",Negative
Intel,"Sometimes even big developers put surprisingly little work into assessing system requirements. Assassin's Creed Unity lists the GTX 680 as the minimum spec GPU and the GTX 780 (same architecture, more cores) as the recommended GPU.",Neutral
Intel,"A380 is \~140% raster performance of 890M based on Steel Nomad scores, doesn't seem faster than 890M at least at the wattages those are ran at",Negative
Intel,"tbf the base requirement for Microsoft is probably the Series S, a case the B390 is probably competitive with.",Neutral
Intel,"At the same time, it seemed to run at 30fps on the series X. So I’ll assume it’ll be pretty CPU heavy.",Neutral
Intel,UE5 is the ultimate benchmark for this GPU.,Positive
Intel,"> You can find 5050 laptops for the same price.   For now, I wouldn't hold on and wait for better prices. Panther Lake laptops are being priced in the post RAM hike world. Older laptops are still floating around and being priced of DDR prices from 6 months ago.  If that 5050 laptop launched today, it would have to deal with $100+ dollars in extra manufacturing cost.  Also the initial launch models for new Intel CPUs always come at a premium. Budget models will come and also prices will be slashed from launch prices. Something that has already happened with older generations.",Neutral
Intel,Shouldn't the base line be the new Xbox handheld?,Neutral
Intel,"If you're talking about the ROG Ally, then no.",Neutral
Intel,"No, I'm talking about the Xbox Ally X.",Neutral
Intel,"Okay, so same thing. No, that is not Microsoft's baseline.",Neutral
Intel,"Why not? Microsoft announced it like it's an official console, shouldn't their first party studios support it then?",Neutral
Intel,"Probably two main reasons off the top of my head: the Xbox Ally released quite late in this console cycle and it's very weak. There already exists a large library of games that would not be playable and Microsoft suddenly (drastically) lowering the minimum target would be messy for devs. Even the Series S can barely do raytracing effects, for example. [Microsoft maintains a compatibility list](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/handhelds/handheld-compatibility) much like Valve with the Steam Deck.  Maybe things change with the next gen if Microsoft brings out a first party handheld, but for now it's just a bonus if runs on the Ally.",Negative
Intel,"What purpose is going to be achieved by supporting superficial gimmicks like ray tracing? Four generations of NVidia, three generations of AMD in, it's still incredibly difficult to find a game where the ray tracing is visible without a side-by-side screenshot comparison AND where it doesn't make the game look worse. And forcing that setting to ""on"" with certain presets doesn't exactly fix that in any way. Sure, I can continue to waste power and processing cycles on it, but it doesn't change how I still have yet to find enough games to tick BOTH of those boxes to run out of fingers on the two hands. Even after padding out the list with Quake 2 and crap Minecraft variant.",Negative
Intel,">Both Arc Pro B70 and Pro B65 are based on the BMG-G31 GPU, which is now confirmed. The memory configuration is also the same. Both cards are said to feature 32GB of GDDR6 on a 256-bit bus. The main difference is GPU core configuration. [...]  >Based on conversations we have had, it appears Intel has put the gaming variant on hold, possibly to see how the memory market develops.

Intel,This guy was talking about the A310 which is a $100 GPU. Basically said that the only other options at that price bracket are either a GT 710 or a GT 1030. And from AMD you can still get an old RX 550. The A310 may be slow but it beats those two gpu's by a mile.,Neutral

Intel,"die area is not the only cost indicator. B580 actually uses N5 fab, which is likely cheaper than N4, used by 5050. In reality, B580 only has about ~15% more transistors and if we assume N5 is cheaper per transistor and N5 has higher yields (by being more mature) i'd say their die cost might be very similar.  While yes, it has wider memory, the chips are clocked lower, so they can buy slower bins, reducing per chip cost.   B580 has more power draw, which in turn costs more for power delivery and cooling.  All in all, AIB manufacturer likely has lower margin per card as it stands, so i wouldn't be surprised if intel is taking a lower margin on the gpu/gddr combo to get more market share.  Nvidia on the other hand optimized their cost REALLY well, as they have been doing GPUs for almost 30 years.",Neutral
Intel,"Nvidia is getting such good performance out of such a small die because they're the best. Simple as. They've been doing GPU's for decades. It's not unexpected that at this stage Intel needs to use a larger die to match the performance - it would be incredibly surprising if that wasn't the case.  But a small *part* of that die size advantage comes from that narrow 128bit bus, and *part* of B580's appeal is its wider bus and subsequently more VRAM.",Positive

Personally i think the harm they do to the space/peoples mentality is farm more than the amount of good most (key word most, fire risks and stuff deserve prompt drama) of their coverage does.   Even this title takes a topic and very educational opportunity to provide actual hardware coverage and immediatly try’s to stoke negative furry about some aspect of the hardware industry. Its just non stop with them. I dont think its healthy for anyone to watch then honestly, which is sad as i used to enjoy their review/news. I hope for their sake they are not actually so perpetually angry and they are doing what they do to knowingly manipulate their audience for increased views/engagement. I cant imagine living life so constantly angry at every possible point over computer hardware, as much as i am saddened by the current state hardware and love gaming.   As tough as it is with rising prices and such and sad to think of what we could have instead, modern hardware, gaming, and such is in a nearly historic good state (realistic cost to perf is probably lowest in history other than brief periods such as the 30 series launch), and is a very cost effective hobby compared with other ones for the time you get out of it. Many great games launch all the time (even if big name traditional games have largely went to trash). They are easier to run with hardware (like the ARC gpu) being quite cheap and capable. People, like GN, need to temper their overexagerated frustration with a dose of real world perspective and objectivity.",Negative

Intel,yeah there is a reason the a310 cards they are making are 4 hdmi out.  Gotta know your market,Neutral
Intel,I assume those are being marketed to OEMs who make digital billboard systems or something. No idea why else you would want 4 HDMI ports on a card.,Neutral
Intel,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310. Almost anything these days is better than an A310.  >  Like the GT710 make no sense nowadays (their last attempt was what, the GeForce GTX 1630?), even though they sold like hotcakes for offices and for people who just wanted HDMI outs.  GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered. GTX 1630 was okay but it was supposed to be $149 USD MSRP and it came out for like $200 USD in most stores due to GPU shortage at the time, not much NVIDIA could really do about that.",Neutral

Relying on the Strix Halo is not an option here.  It's pretty much impossible to find a good laptops that use it.  The upcoming HX470, and still without FSR4, isn't going to close the apparent large gap.  It seems that AMD forgot to stay hungry and they'll end up losing whatever ground that they'd gained in the last few years.

Strix Point at launch had little products (Asus being the only OEM per usual) and yet they still continue to grow, at a smaller scale relative to Intel.

Intel is really dependent on CCG, it is double in revenue to DCAI. They invest in what makes them money. Compared to AMD, client and DCAI is doing well, for client CPUs and GPUs are doing well, putting no pressure in mobile, in fact their strategy has remained the same in the past couple the years and even if marginally their % share is sufficient for them.

I'd be honestly surprised if Xe3 was worse than their current offerings. I'm sure it still has shortcomings as all Intel GPUs will because they're simply starting fresh, but even my A750 is pretty good right now at playing anything I throw at it.  The only aspect Intel kind of messed up that annoys me is their video encoder, once it gets pegged to 100%, it absolutely tanks your performance on the capture to the point where it skips frames and lags. It never used to do that and the driver also used to include capture software, now they just offload it to people having to download OBS and removed the capture aspect of the driver.

Intel,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips. But if you want true performance, just go out and buy an RTX X060 series laptop it's far better price to perf each generation.",Neutral

On GPU the same, AMD does not compete with NVIDIA in higher segments while NVIDIA is fairly comfortable with their setup and increases prices because they want to milk customers to increase their ridiculious margins (up to 70%) that they are used to from AI-Chips.   And now Intel also provides Multi-Frame generation, while a niche for me still, starting to compete with AMD and closes up to NVIDIA in terms of Software support, which they lacked the most and fixes a lot of problems.   Now let them release a B770 that is rumoured to be fairly mid/high range and we can hope for competition that actually learned from bad products recently and tries to make it better.",Neutral

Intel,What do you mean that a refreshed Strix Point can’t compete with an updated architecture?,Neutral
Intel,"I got downvoted everytime I brought this up, but this is precisely why Nvidia wanted a deal to have an Nvidia iGPU tile on an Intel APU: Large iGPUs in thin and lights are going to get good enough over the next few years to make them the new entry-level graphics option for people. This directly threatens Nvidia's consumer laptop volume in the entry segment. Intel is claiming close to 4050 performance at this lower TDP, and that's certainly good enough for many to not have the tradeoffs of having a dGPU in their laptop.  If the new market is moving towards putting GPUs on the CPU package instead of discretely on the board, Nvidia doesn't want to place all of their hopes on WoA becoming better, and are hedging by doing both their own SoC *and* an x86 APU with Intel.  The XPS line dropping Nvidia discrete all together is proof of this. In these sub 70W total laptop power markets, a discrete GPU is just eats into the power budget too much.",Neutral
Intel,"In the ultraportables market (like XPS), integrated graphics just make so much sense (energy envelope; cooling system required; battery life; etc); and that's already substantial and before considering the cost of a NVIDIA mobile dGPU itself.

Intel,"I'm just curious how they handle the need for such high speed RAM on desktop though? I guess this is an application where CAMM2 will be required, I don't think DDR5-9600+ is possible without it and this is presumably pretty key to the performance.",Neutral
Intel,"It certainly would make a huge difference because iGPUs are very memory bandwidth bound; and as the name suggests, LPDDR5 9600 has literally twice the bandwidth of the JEDEC standard 4800.  Unfortunately I doubt we'll see reasonably priced laptops with LPDDR5 9600 -- even as an add-on option. I've been eyeing Dells and Lenovos, and basically all SKUs that previously had 6000 are getting substituted with 4800; and many SKUs that were 2x16GB are now 1x16GB; yes **single channel**.... they charge you extra if you want 2x8GB.",Neutral

Intel,??? lunar lake has already shown to be faster than the 890m.  73 percent though seems like a bit much since panther lake was claimed to be around a 50 percent increase over lunar lake,Neutral
Intel,"They did make a graph specifically to compare the performance of HX 370 and this Arc B390 while they were both using 2x upscaling, which is where this 73% number comes from. In another graph featuring supposedly ""native"" 1080p, they claimed Arc B390 was 82% faster than the HX 370 (why don't they just call it Radeon 890M though...)",Neutral
Intel,"No, intel claims 73% with upscaling (both) and 82% native",Neutral
Intel,"If it was only a 73% gain *including* MFG, then that would be a serious performance regression. If they were using MFG in their graphs, it would easily be 200% - 300% ""faster"" at the same ""real"" performance",Negative
Intel,"The graphs all listed games and I didn't see any synthetic benchmark scores were listed, so yeah.",Neutral
Intel,The relative proportion of the die isn't as important as the die size itself and the node ofc.   Lunar lake for example has an estimated die size smaller than the hx370 so even if they did make the die bigger I don't think that is going to massively raise the price. Not to mention intel owns the foundry unlike AMD who are outsourcing to TSMC. This isn't in the realm of a strix halo competitor with a 300 mm\^2 + die size.   Dell for example has already refreshed the XPS line with intel panther lake and cut out the option for a dedicated gpu.,Neutral

Intel,AMD is planning on again using RDNA 3.5 on their next mobile chips as well.,Neutral
Intel,Not an ideal solution but Optiscaler exists,Negative
Intel,"NVIDIA has increased margins but they haven't been that terrible. Part of the compounding issue at play is limited TSMC capacity; with both gaming and DC on the same TSMC node.

Intel,Who said anything about basing the entire product stack around handhelds?,Neutral
Intel,"That's not quite right. Power levels are determined by the frequency of a given CPU core. The LPE cores in Lunar and Panther lake both clock up to 3.7 GHz, so given the added IPC of the new Panther lake e-cores and better process node, it is more efficient.

Intel,Xe3p was alr confirmed coming im sure Celestial happens,Neutral
Intel,"We will see, while Intel's PR and marketing is extremely confusing, Intel did confirm Xe3P will come to desktop; and at least from driver updates (as a very happy B580 owner) driver support has been constant and lively.  I had some issues with an older Civ game, I reported an issue in [their app](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000057021/graphics/other-graphics.html) with screenshots/etc, and while I never got any notification, the game works perfectly now a few months later. Dunno if they read those reports, but my card keeps getting better.  I actually think a MSRP B580 is another card that will age like fined wine -- YMMV depends on games you play, but in Australia they have been regularly sold slightly below international MSRP and represent phenomenal value in the price class.",Positive
Intel,That's bloody good for an iGPU. It's been nice to see them finally get to respectable performance over the last few years. Intel in particular has really upped their iGPU game & it shows.,Positive
Intel,not to mention it is a little skewed as they threw in a title which pushed the vram limit on the 4050 making the b390 over 800 percent faster in that title which obviously messes with the average.,Negative
Intel,It's 10% faster geomean across 45 games,Positive
Intel,That can be resolved if either Intel or AMD decides to unlock quad-channel on consumer chips and mobos. It's artificial market segmentation; the die area needed to deliver more (LP)DDR5 channels is absolutely minuscule; for a huge boost in iGPU performance.,Neutral
Intel,Cache. Lots of it.,Neutral
Intel,"They are using 9600mt/s lpddr5x, could also have a lot of cache, (iirc 890m configs were nerfed in cache because they wanted to put a npu instead), and also could be a synthetic benchmark or specific game that isn't very bandwidth heavy.",Neutral
Intel,Panther Lake still has a 128 bit memory bus so only models with 9600 mt/s will get slightly faster shared memory bandwidth than Lunar Lake.   I wonder how this will manifest in games as the only performance leaks have been from Geekbench and 3DMark which may not be as bandwidth intensive as real games and applications.,Neutral
Intel,"This seems to be correct, since checking NotebookCheck for the 30 watt 4050 shows that it’s around 70% faster than the HX370 in games, which is roughly where Intel places their iGPU.  The performance difference between a 30 watt 4050 and full 140 watt 4050 is around 41 percent performance based on Time Spy",Positive
Intel,"basically cheating tho, rtx cards in dell laptops are barely getting enough watts to even turbo",Negative
Intel,"That's the only way to do a fair comparison, really.   Because the 45 watts that Intel chip uses is shared for the entire chip.   So it's still 45w Intel + igpu vs 60w Intel+gpu",Neutral
Intel,"It’s a super strong generational gain though, it’s like the jump from Vega 8CU to rdna2 12CU. The kind of single gen gain you see once in 5 years at most",Positive
Intel,The thing about that... what sort of tile are we expecting them to package up? As you say if we can get 4050ish performance from an Intel iGPU then they really can't be far off 5050M... and maybe even 5060M performance in future.  Do you think they'll offer something like a 5070 tile? that almost seems excessive (and difficult to actually package from a thermal point of view in a laptop) but it seems like the 5050/5060 sort of tier is going to be pretty well covered as a traditional iGPU soon.,Neutral
Intel,AMD actually introduced lower tier Strix Halos in this CES; and the first budget laptop thats gonna use it is [the Asus TUF A14](https://youtu.be/h27w0PXFBgk?si=Pa7UQhinywF-uFMj&t=306),Positive

Intel,"Different poster than OP.  Compute tile on Lunar Lake is 140mm2 on N3E with a small 46mm2 controller N6 tile. Strix Point (HX 370) as a whole is 233 mm2 on N4P. Lunar Lake is clearly cheaper, but given the newer node and packaging not massively so, likely by around 20-25%.  Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins. For all purposes it's an accounting trick to hide CCG's and DCAI's 5-15% operating margins if you divide the foundry losses per group revenue.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, although the actual low power 8 core successor to Lunar Lake is the 335/365 with half GPU cores and slower RAM.",Neutral
Intel,"even if you exclude the CPU CCDs the graphics die alone is bigger than a RTX 5070Ti mobile GPU, which also retails for \~$2000-$3000, same as Strix Halo laptop",Neutral
Intel,"This is slightly splitting hairs but the 8c CCDs in Strix Halo is actually NOT the same chiplet as the ones in desktop zen 5 parts. It iirc is produced on a smaller node, slimmed down, and has different ( or no) TSVs.  It is similar to design and cache sizes to desktop however, but the changes to the CCDs were done to improve low power performance characteristics. They are likely a bit more expensive than Desktop CCDs.  I believe it is discussed in a chips&cheese deep dive.",Neutral
Intel,"AMD have largely been ""winning by doing nothing"" due to their better driver support stack for gaming on iGPUs, rather than actually throwing superior hardware at it.  It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.  Given how effective DLSS is on the Switch2, one could only imagine how kickass a Nvidia chip in a handheld PC could be with the far more ubiquitous DLSS support.",Neutral
Intel,Now they are not. The panther lake igpus are undisputed winners (excluding the 395+ from amd since it's just not gonna be mainstream). You can get a 358H or 368H and you'll have solid laptop for igpu gaming far cheaper than the 395+,Positive

Intel,"Well you said it, it's TSMC capacity, meaning also a priority issue. They prioritize AI over consumers and then increase the price by reducing availability, meaning the same chip costs more, meaning more margin.  Seeing they increase the 5090 to roughly 5k (USD) is just the beginning and as I know all companies will use the increasing memory prices to say they must increase the product price, just not proportional to the memory costs.  next step: then they will use this to move more to streaming instead of owning",Neutral

Intel,"If you're referring to the April dump, heck even the August dump (analysis of Kepler\_L2 patents) then that's not close to the complete picture. A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.  Sorry for the rambling.",Neutral

Intel,"I enjoy reading your optimism. I hope it all comes true, but it sounds a bit too good to be true given the recent hardware developements. The 5090 scaling issue is that we stopped resolution scaling. If you go beyond 4k the 5090 scales a lot. VR resolutions report the 5090 being as much as twice the framerates of 4090.",Positive
Intel,I've rewritten prev reply to provide more info.

Intel,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW? But yeah high end perf scaling falls apart at sub 4K internal res.",Negative
Intel,"I dont think much can be done with overhead. AMDs overhead is already small, basically letting the API go directly to GPU as it is. While for Nvidia side, isnt most of the overhead related to how Nvidia handles DX12? in that case i dont see it going away for a long time.",Negative
Intel,"Interesting, GN usually gets Tom to do discussions like these but instead decided to publish whatever that previous video was on 'Intel pulling an Nvidia'. I bet GN will probably have their own video with Tom, but I appreciate DF a little bit more with this discussion.

At around 23min, Alex brought up something interesting about research they've published before on joint denoiser and SR. He kinda skirts around it, but continues on suggesting they have more plans on it.

Intel,We are paying more attention to it but I suspect as we push higher frames with new engines and techniques the micro stutter is getting worse. It just starts becoming less perceptible to people than say the micro stutter from SLI and other stuff that caused issues in the past.,Negative
Intel,"I think digital foundry answered that question on their podcast. Compared to 15 years ago the frame rate is higher on average for most gamers, but it also stutters more. So it's huge fps with huge drops and hangs.",Neutral

Edit: it's also key to remember that a lot of the games that stutter on PC these days stutter in the exact same places for the exact same reasons, and worse considering the lack of CPU power, on consoles.

Instead, he just tore the 9060 XT 8GB down and never touched it again after that teardown. I'm sorry but there's GENUINELY stuff he could be doing instead of farming clicks about 'NVIDIA bad' and 'Intel pathetic', but that won't get him views from drama farming NVIDIA which is what he craves these days.

Intel,"Geekbench’s scaling has always been problematic, and the differences between architectures are huge. The benchmark is very friendly to ARM and least favorable to AMD. Even a random Apple M5 chip can easily score close to 20,000.  Therefore, cross-architecture comparisons using Geekbench scores have little real meaning. The only valid reference is **same-generation, same-architecture comparisons**, such as between the 285H and 388H.  Based on the actual results, the improvements are about **9% in single-core** and **21% in multi-core**. Given that the 285H scores around **22,500** in Cinebench, I estimate that the 388H should be able to reach roughly **24,000**.  But the key point is **power efficiency at lower power limits**. For example, if the 285H needs around **80W** to reach 22,500, then the real question is:  * How much power does the 388H need to reach 22,500? * How many watts does it take to exceed 20,000?  This is what really matters. If the 388H can achieve 2**0,000 at 35W**, **22,500 at 60W**, and **24,000 at 80W**, then that would represent massive progress.

Intel,"It’s obvious that this is the viewpoint of an outsider. Professionals would never look at it this way. Professionals first evaluate a processor based on its specifications, features, and process technology. Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake are *not* using some outdated process — they use TSMC’s then-most-advanced N3B node, Intel’s first time adopting it. Meanwhile, Panther Lake uses Intel’s own **18A** process.  Based on the current benchmark results, Intel’s 18A appears to outperform TSMC’s N3B by at least the same margin that **Intel 4** trailed behind N3B — which is an astonishing result.  Every day you hear people saying how much TSMC has advanced, how far ahead its processes are, how “outdated” Intel’s nodes are, how AMD’s processors using TSMC have excellent efficiency. These kinds of statements have been repeated endlessly over the past decade.  Yet today, Intel is using its newest process node to **clearly surpass** TSMC’s top process from just one year ago.",Neutral
Intel,"the real test will be how many watts the X9 388H needs to achieve its scores, because the 285HX needed like 90 watts to achieve its scores  so if the X9 could hit its scores while on its base TDP (65 watts) then thats a \~40% increase in efficiency, not bad",Neutral

Intel,"For the use cases of PTL, Geekbench (which is mostly consumer focused) is a good indicator.  It doesn't assume that its workloads are perfectly parallel, it assumes some threads are used more heavily than others, so its value in nT is influenced by its 1T.

Intel,"I have carefully compared the various models across Geekbench, PassMark, and the differences between Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake. If my judgment is correct, the theoretical peak performance of the 484 in Cinebench R23 should reach around **24,500**; the 285H scores **22,500**. Compared with the 285H, it should be easier for the 484 to achieve high scores because its power requirements are significantly lower than the previous generation built on TSMC N3B.  Its peak performance will not be extremely strong because the frequency is not high. IPC is likely improved by around **10–11%**, but clock speeds drop by about **6%**. Overall, that means single-core performance should only rise by **4–5%**.  The improvement will be most noticeable in Geekbench. Since PassMark single-core also shows gains, the IPC uplift and resulting single-core increase should be quite certain. If Geekbench were the only source, it would still be questionable, but PassMark is more solid and has higher reference value.  Overall, in terms of peak performance, the uplift is average—around **10%**, close to that figure.  However, the real key is the **efficiency gains**. I believe they will be excellent. Compared with the 285H, which requires **65 W** to reach **20,000** points in Cinebench R23, I estimate that the **388H** may only need **40–45 W**.  I also estimate that the Cinebench R24 score should fall around **1300–1400**. Compared with Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 at **1950**, there is still a significant gap—but the two products differ drastically in scale.  Overall, Panther Lake’s greatest achievements lie in several aspects:  1. **Energy efficiency** — likely the best among all x86 products. 2. **Performance per mm²** — excellent. For example, the 484: if you look at its die shot, the total area of the CPU (including the CPU tile’s 4P and 4 LPE cores and all caches) is essentially equal to the die area of a traditional monolithic 8-core design. That means the 484 uses the same silicon resources as past 8-core chips, yet **no AMD mobile 8-core processor surpasses it**, either in raw performance or efficiency. 3. It also offers better performance-per-area than Qualcomm’s processors. The X Elite 2 has **18 cores**, including **12 “very large” cores**—similar in size to Intel P-cores—and **6 large cores**, each larger than Intel’s E-cores. The die area of this chip is **2.5× larger** than Panther Lake 484’s.",Neutral

Because that is the only useful measure of ""inflation"". Everything else is just corporate profits   If prices for everything go up but wages don't then that leaves less money for frivolous shit like ram and storage and laptops and consoles, not more.  Even in my country where our wages are automatically indexed to match inflation, our purchasing power has dropped because the actual cost of living isn't properly represented in whichever calculation is used for the inflation number.  Houses have gone up by 100+ percent since 2015, rents have gone up by over 60 percent, grocery prices have more than doubled, utility prices have risen sharply, public transport has more than tripled in cost.

People would still rather spend more on a basic nvidia from the 5000 series.,Negative
Intel,B580 user here. I coupled it with a R5 5500 and as of the recent updates the card just seemed to run much better vs when I got it last July.  There was a video before which also revealed that the CPU overhead is now being addressed in subsequent updates.  https://youtu.be/gfqGqj2bFj8?si=PyAfB2NhqZKWWVXY  I’d say it’s getting better and that I’d recommend it over a 5050 since the overhead is now fixed/negligible.,Positive
Intel,Intel is in their second GPU generation. Its going to take a lot longer to catch up with the institutional knowledge and practical application in videogames that the others were developing for over 20 years.

That's $900/$455 today, thereabouts.  What does $900 get you today?  Does that buy you anywhere near the top end?  And how does that product compare in relation to others above and below it?  Because the $330 product in question ($455 today) got you about ~75% to top end performance for ~half~ MSRP of the 980TI.  How does a $455 product of today square up relative to the top end?   Why don't we throw in a GTX 980TI vs a GTX 280 comparison while we're at it.  Make things really interesting.  I'll let you fill in those blanks (along with the $330 card in question) hoping you actually learn something in the process here.  The bar is very low, try not to trip.

When it refreshes the tree it asks connected devices if they are online, including the HDDs. Now move the window back and forth between your screens. When the explorer moves into HDR screen, it gets redrawn. Same when it moves to SDR screen. I suspect but cannot confirm there is a bug where the old instance is not cleaned correctly.

Intel,[This video](https://youtu.be/oF3gLKmYqpE?si=If70o-_RamZOxXJS) suggests the upgraded GPU will have the desired effect even if there is some performance left on the table. This might now be a bad thing as when the (if!) price of RAM comes back down I can upgrade the rest and keep the GPU.,Neutral
Intel,5700x3d/5800x/5800x3d would be a good upgrade,Positive
Intel,"That's the CPU I have. I upgraded to it at the beginning of last year. My system is a 5800XT paired with a 5070 TI and 32gb of DDR4. It does everything that I want it it, in the resolution and fps that I want. Except for Tarkov. It looks great, but without Smooth Motion, I'm only getting 70-100 fps with maxed out settings on most maps.  I actually just recently upgraded to the 5070 TI, from a 3080. Nice jump. I think later this year, I am going to upgrade to AM5 and I really want an X3D chip, so probably the new 9850X3D. I'm also going to shoot for 64gb of DDR5, unless it's still $1k. Lol!",Positive
Intel,"That would mean spending £200ish on the CPU, and then £1000 On the GPU and a couple hundred on the PSU. A new 5080 pre-built is around £2k.",Neutral
Intel,UK. We have very few options for walk in PC component shopping.      Around £1000.,Negative
Intel,r/usdefaultism,Neutral
Intel,No but if my 3060 isn't hitting that at 1080p what hope does it have for 1440?,Neutral
Intel,"If the solution is a complete build I'll hold fire while I save as I don't want to buy a new machine that's less capable than I'd like.      My first PC was a budget option and I've been duct taping new components onto that ever since. Next time I want to get the top of the range out the gate.      So basically, if I can't cheaply duct tape another cheap part to this old workhorse then my budget is limited only by my patience.",Negative
Intel,I'm fairly certain my motherboard will take the CPU as the website says it works with any AM4 chip. Is there a possibility the marketing is being sneaky?,Neutral
Intel,Just under £200 from Amazon. It's very edible at that price.,Positive
Intel,x3ds are gone for AM4 unless you wanna get taxed hard for used,Neutral
Intel,"x3d's are out of stock, only ones left are heavily upcharged.",Negative
Intel,ah yeah a prebuilt is the way then. Man are they really charging 1000 for a 5070 there? for reference i run a 12900k and a 4070 super on 650w with room to spare. My other PC is an 11700k w/ a 3060ti and thats on a 500w. The 5070 wouldn't need more than a 650w with a 5080xt cpu.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah get the prebuilt and sell your current PC, you should be able to get $500 for it",Neutral
Intel,How much ram do you have in your current build?,Neutral
Intel,It is what it is,Neutral
Intel,"That’s why I suggested a 5700x too.   As you move up the resolutions, the GPU has less of an impact on performance jumps.",Neutral
Intel,"You can cheaply duck tape it like, for sure! Although, I think the middle ground between cheap upgrades and a New Build is the smart choice.     Upgrading your CPU to a 5600(x)/5700x/5800x/5700x3D would get your better performance on your current hardware. The 5600 is £90 right now.     Upgrading your GPU to support your new 1440p monitor with something like a 9070 XT and a new 850w PSU(unless you have a recent/decent psu). You can also get a cheaper GPU, the 9060 XT 16gb/5060 Ti 16gb are way faster than the 3060.      Doing these specific upgrades would allow you to take your GPU and PSU to your next build. With the GPU+PSU already purchased, you would just need a Case, storage, CPU/MoBo/RAM.    Buying the CPU/GPU/PSU now will get you the best performance for the least amount of money. I strongly recommend you do this, then plan to upgrade the CPU/MoBo/RAM within 2 years.

Intel,What is the difference with X3D?,Neutral
Intel,£400+ here,Neutral
Intel,"tldr: Much faster for gaming, espcially cpu intensive games  They have extra 3dvcache so the cpu can run more efficiently, which translates to faster performance for gaming. Just see where the x3d's rank in terms of gaming.  https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/cpu-hierarchy,4312-2.html'  Heres a specific benchmark for 5700x3d in arc raiders. Vastly improved 1% lows, 1% lows is the lowest fps you will see. Thats when theres alot going on in game and your performance stutters, so having better 1% lows will prevent that from happening   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzk6J09n\_A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzk6J09n_A)",Positive
Intel,6600XT is still good for 1080p and perfectly matched with your CPU and PSU. For $400 you will not find anything significantly better (new). For used market it is hard to suggest because prices vary widely. I suggest  to save money for new build while using the existing system.,Positive
Intel,budget? PSU?,Neutral
Intel,"Thought about that too, but playing arc is not enjoyable at all",Negative
Intel,"Budget around 400, but im buying used. Psu 650",Neutral
Intel,What an adventure!! Enjoy your new setup 👏👏👏,Positive
Intel,I did the same thing. A couple of years ago I finally said to hell with consoles and I built a PC. I splurged and got the 4090 and holy crap that’s the most amazing decision ever.,Positive
Intel,Look at an x3d. That’s my two cents. Looking good,Positive
Intel,I love that first line of closing thoughts and how PC gaming is a hobby in itself. I remember months ago a friend was talking mess saying you don’t have money to blow cause I’m buying expensive ass PC parts while we were shopping at the mall and looking at gold chains. To me I was like yea it’s a hobby there’s nothing wrong with paying a lot of money for a hobby you love and enjoy. I feel like it hit him pretty hard with the realization that it can be a hobby cause he didn’t say anything back but he had this look and energy of “oh shit that’s true.” To him lol,Positive
Intel,Grats on 30. It gets worse.,Negative
Intel,"Sounds great, happy for you. Gathering up parts (on sale, open box or used) is so much more fun and better value for the money. 5070 is a good choice for your set up. Enjoy your new gaming pc.",Positive

Intel,Congrats! Happy gaming!,Positive
Intel,"Sounds like you really had fun with, enjoy your rig!",Positive
Intel,"Grats on the new setup, also go ahead and get project lasso and tune your games to behave better across the cores and the right speed plus priority and you'll see better stability from your system :)",Positive
Intel,"I was in that phase too. At some point I noticed I would rather game more than tinker more, never overclocked anything again and just was happy with every game running as it happens to run.n  It's a lot easier with VRR nowadays.",Positive
Intel,Can't find it under 350€ used...,Negative
Intel,Def more of a hobby than buying gold chains. Lol.,Neutral
Intel,Bro that's smart af!,Positive
Intel,Yeah it was starting to get hard to remember everything I had in the past so just did a brain dump into a spreadsheet a few years ago.,Negative
Intel,Do not buy a high end cpu but garbage gpu. The other way is better. https://pcpartpicker.com/list/wrMq6Q The 5060 8gb is utter garbage. Do not buy it. 9060xt 16gb or 5060ti 16gb MINIMUM.,Negative
Intel,"If youre flexible about turning the graphics down and on a budget like you say, then you do not need a 16 GB card for anything. I run my games mostly maxed out with a RX 7600 8GB at 1080p which is comparable to that card. Dont let people convince you to waste money. Being willing to turn the graphics down a bit is the best way to save money doing this, youre doing it right.",Neutral
Intel,"for that price please look on fb marketplace, ive been seeing some good deals in that price range with 5070’s and 7800x3d’s",Positive
Intel,If you are playing @1080p i think the build makes sense but id try to get the 16gb version if possible,Neutral

Intel,Bestbuy has a good selection of prebuilt PCs for your budget,Positive
Intel,That card is definitely not garbage. This person says they're willing to turn the graphics down... why would they need 16 GB minimum? I run modern games with a card similar to the 5060 mostly on high some maxed out with no issues at all.,Neutral
Intel,Your best bet is buying a prebuild (OEMs get parts cheaper). But even then the prices still suck and you'd be getting significantly less than you would have just a month ago,Negative
Intel,"It is a bad time to build 100%  DDR5 ram prices have quadrupled- the GenAI bubble is gobbling up all supply   DDR4 ram prices have tripled - demand is high since DDR5 is expensive   SSD prices have doubled - the GenAI bubble is gobbling up supply   GPU prices have increased - vram costs more due to the GenAI bubble, and they are literally making less gaming GPUs because they make more money making AI GPUs  Unless the bubble pops sooner than expected, many speculate prices will not start to drop until fall this year",Negative
Intel,"I suppose it depends on your scope.   Is it a good time to build compared to a year ago? FUCK. NO.   Is it a good time to build compared to 6 months from now? Who knows. Prices could go down. More likely they'll hold steady or go up.   Ultimately you have to choose when to pull the trigger, and accept in-advance that there may be a more optimal time to buy in the future.",Neutral
Intel,"not really, RAM and storage are both hugely inflated. Not sure if there's an end in sight, though.",Negative
Intel,Right now is the worst time in recent history to build a new PC. Tomorrow will be even worse though,Negative
Intel,It's bad. And it's going to get worse. Prices will probably take years to recover.,Negative
Intel,"I just built my first PC, I bought everything secondhand from FB marketplace except the case. I think it was $350 total, I can play everything (so far) maxed out. It took a lot of running around and some sketchy situations but it was 100% worth it.",Positive
Intel,Lots of FOMO.  But its either now or never.  Nobody can predict prices in a year or two or three.,Negative
Intel,"I think right this very moment prebuilts are the best value that they have been in years. I love building PCs and I have been lucky enough to build a new one every couple of years and then passing down my ""old"" one. That's out of the window and now I'm likely going to keep my 2 current machines for the next few years because prices aren't going down anytime soon.     There are some good prebuilt options, you can even buy a used system.",Positive
Intel,"What region shopping in for parts, any chance access to a Micro Center? If can find a good deal for a combo deal with ram, could be worth for sure. Else, maybe a pre-built.",Neutral
Intel,"I hear ppl say this crisis could last a couple years. And when it’s over prices will drop, but sadly I don’t expect back to the levels we were last year 😔",Negative
Intel,It's the worst time I've ever encountered in 25 years.,Negative
Intel,No,Neutral
Intel,I wanted to upgrade my 5 year old build.. but waited too long,Negative
Intel,"I recently bought a fairly high end PC and my final price tag ended up at roughly $4500.  It's a bad time to be a builder, but I don't think it'll get better anytime soon. The RAMpocalypse has just begun and I expect prices to rise further and I don't think we'll see a normalization of prices for a few years at least.  AI companies have bought out future stock, leaving less for the rest of us. Producers are shifting production to cater to AI companies, leaving even less for the rest of us.  It's bleak now and looking to get bleaker.. Unless the AI bubble unexpectedly pops.  Maybe you can get a decent used one? Many builders are looking to offset the price of their new builds by selling their old ones instead of keeping them as backups.",Negative
Intel,no. But it could get worse,Negative
Intel,I hate to say it but right now buying a prebuilt is more cost efficient. A lot of these prebuilts are mass produced and were built before RAM prices went through the roof. Now they can afford to sell them for the regular price without losing any money. It's only a matter of time before they start jacking up the prices of these prebuilts.,Neutral
Intel,"Same question, different day.",Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, no. Get a prebuilt or used.",Neutral
Intel,"Nope. Wait. Buy used to get by, don't get into FOMO. We've been through this before, it'll get better.",Neutral
Intel,"It is a terrible time, BUT the next two years may be worse.",Negative
Intel,Only if you're doing a slightly older build with used psrts. Even then probs not worth it. Prebuikt is most cost effective now because of everything thats already been said,Negative
Intel,"Buying pre-built doesn't feel too bad, as at least the price has you getting mutliple things, but god I could only imagine reaching the point in a build to buy a video card & RAM.  Was looking for a 5090 yesterday and saw Microcenter had a pre-built that had one for roughly 4k, or buy the card itself for 3.9k.",Neutral
Intel,"Price fluctuation is certainly an issue and, unless the AI bubble pops soon like others have suggested, there is no guarantee that prices will go down.   One thing you could do is design your ideal rig and get parts incrementally, as budget and sales will allow. Alternatively, you could build a rig that will allow you to run a majority of games you want on low to medium and upgrade as time and budget will allow. My point is, what is your timeline?",Neutral
Intel,"Just ended up settling for a pre built for my girlfriend's birthday from Microcenter. Even with the microcenter bundles that save you a ton, I was having trouble building a rig for even around the same price as the prebuilt I got. The prebuilt has a 7800x3d and a 5070 ti. The microcenter bundle with a mobo, 32 GB of ram, and the 7800x3d was $750, and the 5070 ti was around $800 at that point. (They literally just raised the MSRP of that card too) So I was already looking at $1550 without a case, ssd, cooling, power supply, operating system. The prebuilt was $1700 with a 2tb ssd, aio cooler, lian li case, gold rated PSU. So as much as I wanted to build things myself it would have been stupid financially or ended up with a weaker rig at that price point. I could have maybeee gotten close in price if I had gone AM4 instead but I'd rather have the ability to upgrade in the future.",Negative
Intel,"The best time to build a pc, is when you need one. Nobody can predict the future, especially when or if prices are going to return to normal.",Positive
Intel,"Honestly, from a purely pricing perspective, it is almost never a good time to build your own mid-range or lower PC.  However, after the shortages caused by covid 19 and the crypto-inspired GPU shortage, and the rebound in supplies that followed, we are coming off of probably two to three years of historically low prices for ALL components.  And that is what really makes the memory price increases hurt so much.  And it has affected components that use memory (SSDs and GPUs) as well.  So it really feels like the worst time to build a PC.  Historically, there have been much worse periods in which to build a PC.",Negative
Intel,I thought December 2024 was a bad time to build mine... now I look around and am really glad it did it then. Get a prebuilt and save some money.,Positive
Intel,"It’s hard to say, it depends if the Ai hardware rush is a bubble or not. If it’s not, then the sooner the better to build and upgrade, if it is then waiting would be ideal.   If it isnt a bubble, then I may have built my last PC.",Neutral
Intel,Now is not a good time. It is the worst time. Followed by worse times to come. Which makes now a better time than then.  :(,Negative
Intel,If you wait for possible sales or bundles there will be huge discounts to move inventory put for like a 5090 your F’d,Neutral
Intel,"If price is a factor, you might still have a window to actually save money with a prebuilt (since they can buy in bulk for cheaper). But otherwise it’s awful all around, thanks to stupid AI.",Negative

Intel,"I built mine during the GPU shortage back during the Covid crap when GPU’s were overpriced. I lucked out with my RTX 3060 and got two for one. This new thing about NVIDIA upping the prices for GPU’s seems  pretty similar, to me at least.

Intel,Ssd has only went up for 4tb and up.  1tb are still 100-150usd with some 2tb under 200usd.  990pro is still under 600 for a 4tb model.  Everything is a moot point.  Cpu and gpu are in good spots and the saving there make up for price hike in ram compared to building a pc in late 2024.  I however would bump that price up to 1500 if you want a console rivaling experience that will last a few years.  My 1300usd in late 2024 has been a let down compared to my xbox for smooth gameplay.,Neutral
Intel,"Buying a prebuilt with the specs you want is currently cheaper.  Once the stock of parts the manufacturers are sitting on is used up, they will get more expensive.  Good luck OP, and may the odds ever be in your favor.  >Will prices of RAM/SSD/GPU, etc drop eventually?  Yes, in about 2-4 years. Maybe.",Neutral

Intel,No and yes and no one knows is the best answer.,Neutral
Intel,Buy a pre-built from Costco. They are not the greatest specs and you didn't build it yourself but it's a great value with a warranty.,Positive
Intel,"Cutting edge? Probably not - but second hand? There are plenty of great deals out there. I picked up a great deal from someone leaving town. You'll easily get a good few years of use out of them, maybe have to turn fog or shadows down in your games but otherwise still top tier performance for a few years. Will it mean I have to upgrade in 3-5 years instead of 6-7? Yes, but cost wise it's just way more sensible.",Positive

Intel,"the best time to buy was probably a year ago. i got a prebuilt about 14 months ago because i'm canadian and anticipated tariffs being pretty bad. didn't anticipate the AI squeeze on components, so it's gotten even worse. I wouldn't recommend building right now at all.",Negative
Intel,"It's the worst time to upgrade or to build a PC. Storage has increased their price by 200% I think and RAM by like 500%.  I mean, if you are willing to pay around $1000 just for the RAM itself, go ahead, everything else will be cheaper but my recommendation, look for some pre built PCs, you can still find good deals, but if you are going to buy the components one by one, for sure you will spend (or waste) a lot of money.  I was planning to upgrade my PC, but I will stick with DDR4 and my reliable 6700xt for the next two years at least, or whenever prices go down a little.",Negative

If so there may never be a cheaper moment.   Or wild card, is AI going to cause hardware and software capabilities to explode? Then perhaps buying now you'll end up with something obsolete faster than the historical trend.   No one really knows.",Neutral
Intel,I just built mine. All new parts except for the GPU. I belive it was around $650 total. It runs RDR2 at 1440p 60fps which is by far the most demanding game i will ever play so. Fits my needs.,Positive
Intel,Honestly build it right now since I heard nvidia was gonna stop or limit producing pc gpus and focus more on console and their other variant. So the prices of gpus are gonna go up. And ram prices isn't coming down any time soon either because of ai. So build one right now.,Neutral
Intel,"I strongly recommend not to listen to any of the top upvoted comments, because dear lord are they horrible.  You can still do an 900-1000usd AM4 build with an 5600 and 9060XT and play everything you like in 1440p, let alone 1080p.  If you desire, get a 9070 or 9070XT and you can play stuff in 4k.  These are 900-1400usd builds we are talking here.",Negative
Intel,"I remember earlier this year when I was trying to troubleshoot some issues that I thought were RAM at the time (they weren't) I looked up my Amazon purchase history to find the stated specs on my RAM to see that it was like $350. I'd paid a little over $100 for it just the year before.  I thought that it'd been discontinued and that was reseller market pricing. Nope. The world just went fucking insane.  Very bad time to build a computer, also a very bad time for a computer part to break on you.",Negative
Intel,"Unfortunately it is a pretty terrible time to build as far as price goes and that likely won't change for at least a year, unless a miracle occurs like the AI bubble popping (don't bet on it).  Unless you have access to a handful of price minimizing options (like the CPU/RAM/motherboard bundle deals at Microcenter) you're pretty much screwed on new hardware.

Intel,"PCs have always been relatively expensive in the respective days economy.   Today's economy is fucked so therefore PC building is as well.   We have current price increases in ram (especially), SSD and GPU because of AI being targeted by manufacturers.   If you want a PC now, buy it now. Pre built if you aren't too fussed about parts and don't want to do your own build. Own build if you care about parts and want to experience building.

Before you guys bully me listen to my reasoning:  Prices are only going to go up, a bit because of inflation, a bit before there will be shortages in the supply chain because of the global situation, and a bit because other chip components used for AI will create bottlenecks like it happened with GPUs and RAM.   They made it clear that ""we'll own nothing and be happy"" (DAVOS 2016) according to them. This means that they'll push for cloud gaming, PC leasing, and similar BS. We've seen this happen all over the board in many sectors. Why do you believe this will be ignored?   The ""good"" companies will try to keep up for a while but will be forced to surrender because of prices going out of control.   You thing a global Crysis or recession (as the one we're sailing right into) might bring prices down? WRONG. They'll print so much money to save banks and businesses that inflation will make it impossible to own a personal PC.",Negative
Intel,"If you're gaming, I would go budget. There's a lot of good performance on older hardware. There are some good prebuilds out there that you can look into that might be more affordable. That's what I'd do. Get a prebuilt with decent performance, keep it for a couple years and then re-evaluate the market later. Good luck!",Positive

Prices probably aren't going to go down any time soon, so absent going back in time and buying ram a few months ago, might as well just go for it if you can afford it.",Negative

Intel,"Build? Maybe not.  Buy a prebuilt or mini-PC? Maybe.  There are some usable gaming prebuilts and even nice mini-PCs still on the market. If you don't mind gaming at 1080p, a careful purchase can get you in now. My bet would be that in a month or two basically everything that can run a modern game decently for under $1k will be gone, not to return until at least summer 2027.",Neutral
Intel,"With the sudden increase in demand by ai and one guy straight up just buying for 40% of RAMs global supply... no.

Intel,It is not.,Neutral
Intel,"Its the season for prebuilts or used parts. I just rebuilt my PC having replaced my GPU (9070xt) and ended up continue panic buying enough parts to have an entirely new PC.  However, the value of patience cannot be understated, especially with the used market. You can't jump on small savings relative to recent price increases, that's just a recipe for regretting a few months/1 year down the road when prices either stabilize or drop completely. (e.g. snatching at 20% off SSDs when prices have more than doubled).  For example, I ended up obsessively tracking new used listings and managed to get DDR4 32*2 GB 3200mhz sticks for 130usd.   Going jank is another option. I went with a Chinese MODT TOPC board with a 13950HX for 300usd and it performs beyond my wildest dreams if I were to go with standard off-the-shelf parts. Sure these may fail in a year, but I'll take the savings and insane performance (ended up spending only ~1300 for basically top of the line for 1440p) while it works!",Neutral
Intel,It is definitely not a good time to build a pc. RAM prices being as high as they are and the issues with Nvidia cutting production on their GPUs not to mention they’re investing more money and time into AI.. yeah it might be awhile before building a pc is worth it again. And that’s unfortunate because AMD has stated they’re doing the same thing so it’s a shit show.,Negative

Intel,"No, clearly not. It hasn't been a good time for a while. This pattern I see, when a hobby goes mainstream, capitalists find a way to cash in on it as much as possible, which ruins it for everyone.

Yes. Is that this year, next year, 5 years from now? Absolutely no one can say.  New chip manufacture facilities are coming online, AI demand won’t be infinite because we don’t have infinite power.  When component costs get like this, prebuilts start to gain in value. You could look at those, or just deal with using GeForce now or something for a stop gap.

Intel,Only way to get these prices down is to stop using ai.,Negative
Intel,"It's a horrible time compared to last year, etc, but there's no guarantee even when this ""AI"" bubble bursts that it won't get worse. They really want to move to a cloud-computing ecosystem where the consumer PC market is dead and you just buy some little piece of crap that you then pay them to compute your games/etc because you don't get the privilege of owning a powerful pc anymore. Or even if that doesn't happen, the move towards fully integrated boards where, say, Nvidia just sells a whole ass board with cpu/gpu soldered on and you basically have zero choice on your parts.  Maybe these futures don't come true, but they are certainly what some of the big players WANT to be the future. And if that's the case, then it may be a good time to build a pc because the window to even get to do so could be closing.  So if you do not have a pc, really want/need one, and can afford one, it may very well be worth eating the shitty costs to get it. Yeah it will be expensive but there is no guarantee prices go back down *even if both things I just noted do not happen.*  And the reason prices are skyrocketing is everything being bought up by datacenters, which are currently looking to be used for ""AI"" LLMs but in reality can just be shunted over to cloud-computing, mass surveillance, etc, so again there is no guarantee they don't stop hoarding tech even when the ""AI"" bubble bursts.",Negative
Intel,"Of course it s a good time. But not new pc. Old /used pc. A DDR4/3 pc should be a decent bang for the buck. Or you could go even older, i just payed 5$ for a Pentium 4, playing Half Life 2, Warcraft 3 and Gun 😇",Positive

Intel,"It's definitely not a good time.  Will it get better? We can't really predict it, people like to say in a few years prices will go down a lot, after they AI bubble explodes, but we don't really know how the changes in production and the changes in the companies priorities will affect the landscape long-term.  If you have the money now and want the PC now, I'd just build it; otherwise you'd have to wait probably until late 2027 according to the most optimistic but realistic predictions I've seen.

I got out much cheaper than building new, threw Bazzite on there and I have no regrets been having a blast.

It is not an ideal time to build a PC, but if you are going to need one it is better to buy now than a year from now.  The only sort of PC that I would soft recommend is buying an AMD APU like the 8700G. It has enough integrated graphics performance to play modern games on 1080p at lower settings, and you could overclock it a fair bit if you bought a cooler. It would let you play for now, and you wouldn't need to fork out for a GPU right away. Once you have money for a GPU down the road, it works fine as a CPU. You can look for used RAM and SSDs for cheaper, or settle for a small SSD and rotate through games more frequently. You could pick up a 1TB hard drive for dirt cheap and then just copy games over to your SSD when you want to play them.",Neutral

Intel,"I agree about the price of hardware but companies price based on what the market will bear.  Having built many gaming systems I can tell you that this is a never ending hobby that will consume all your lunch money.  My suggestion is to get a great base motherboard/cpu, a decent amount of ram, and adequate disk space.  You want a board that will have sufficient bus speed and room enough to add a good video card.  Buying used is a great option to save money.   Check the specs for the games you currently want to play, not for every game.  I would discourage buying a pre-built system.  Manufactures take shortcuts and value engineer to reach a certain price point.  You really won't find out what the PC's shortfalls are until after you purchase.  Building your own system gives you the option of swapping out and replacing/upgrading as you see fit.  When you replace a component, don't hold onto it -- sell it.  The longer you keep an unused part, the harder it is to resell.  The ultimate gaming system will be ongoing.  You'll be upgrading video cards, power supplies, memory, and motherboards as the technology improves.

Intel,"Been building my own pc’s for about 20 years.  Love to do it and handpicking your components is great.  In the early days I could save some serious money but the margins have been shrinking every year. I built 3 pc’s in 2022 that should hold up until Windows 12 rears its head. May upgrade the video card on my gaming rig in the meantime.  Windows 12 will probably FORCE us into new hardware which for me would probably be motherboard, ram, cpu and an ssd. I’d expect a prebuilt will cost less by that time.  Sad because building your own is so rewarding.",Positive
Intel,"Honestly, no real timeline.   It’s year after year new awesome games come out that I miss out on so I finally started to look into it- and boom! Worst time ever to buy hahah. I just don’t know much about building or PCs so I figured to ask.",Negative
Intel,That is what I've been doing just buying parts one at a time when i see a deal or discount. I can wait on ram and gpu..,Neutral
Intel,Nah mate. You will build another and definitely upgrade what you have regardless.   If AI companies continues to require all PC hardware be made for them. We will see changes to the PC consumer. What changes exactly time will tell but if you've done a recent build and worst case scenario happens it means you will be set for longer,Neutral
Intel,WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME? DO YOU REALISE WHICH SUBREDDIT YOU ARE IN?,Negative
Intel,"Dude, how can you even suggest that.  Why would we use a service from a company that is enabling the RAMpocalypse to begin with?",Negative

Intel,In other countries SSD prices have hit 2GB 400$ it's the future.. consoles will increase in price too you know. A console is just a PC with autism they are still the same on the inside.,Neutral

Intel,"As someone mentioned, buy prebuild.. Ultra cheaper",Neutral
Intel,"Getting into the hobby is the worst I have ever seen it.  If you have a built PC that you can use some parts, like the PSU and the GPU, it isn't terrible but it still sucks.",Negative
Intel,"There have been constant good times to build a pc. Literally all of 2025 things were cheap. Mid last year any thing you wanted would be in stock as well if it was a 5090 you wanted.   Right now, 64gb a ram is the cost of a mid level rig 4 months ago. The sad part is at least 2026 is likely an entire year of sucky to build in. No 5xxx super series gpus were announced as its data center focus time. Who knows how bad it will stay.",Positive
Intel,Just experienced this getting a prebuilt from microcenter. Had my eye on one of the prebuilts there with a 5070ti in it. They just increased the MSRP of the 5070ti up to $900 but that prebuilt didn't increase in price at the same time.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah I bought a prebuilt with a 9800x3d  and 5070 ti. I normally build all my own stuff but it didn't work that way this time. I plan on selling the 5070 ti and putting my 4090 in after I replace the garbage power supply. Everything else seemed ""good enough"" and not complete trash so that's good haha",Negative
Intel,"Same here, this is the first time I've ever suggested buying prebuild (started with building 10 years ago). I wasn't planning on upgrading this year, was on 2080S, but saw a 5080/9800x3d PC for £2100 at the end of last year and knew if I waited any longer I'd regret it. Wish I'd known someone with a Costco card during the Black Friday sales though...",Neutral
Intel,"Same here. I built a 5060TI self-build for the same price as a pre-built 5070TI at Microcenter (1800). For me, I was not price sensitive and building was the purpose of the hobby, so pre-build didn't make sense. But fuck me if that didn't hurt.",Negative
Intel,"That's a really good deal. I wish they had more locations. MicroCenter is in Miami and I'm in northern Broward. It's like 45 miles away from me. Doesn't sound bad, but what makes it bad is the traffic and the really dangerous drivers. :(",Positive
Intel,"They indeed do at times that are worth it. Unfortunately not as great as it was a month ago like where my buddy got a gaming PC with a 7900X, RTX 5080, 32 GB RAM, and 2 TB NVMe for just $1999. It was an unbelievable deal.",Positive
Intel,"Nope. This isn't bad advice. I don't think you realize how bad the prices are, even on older platforms.  I have a coworker and I was about to give him an AM4 motherboard, RAM, and a PSU for free (I literally just have these parts lying around). He would be coming off of a 9900k. I calculated the cost to get other components, including a 5700X3D CPU and a 5060 Ti 16 GB (selling at around $520 just yesterday) and I found out way better value could be had if he spent a few hundred more on an AM5 prebuild where he'd have a bigger performance boost (it's hard to justify spending $1200-1300 when you include new storage and other accessories on an AM4 upgrade with a 30% performance boost on Tarkov). And again, all of this cost after I give him a bunch of parts for free. X3D CPUs are stupid expensive on AM4 used. You should look at the prices. A 5800X3D is often times being sold at prices higher than a 9800X3D brand new.",Neutral

Intel,"And this is all assuming they come down at all. I fear it'll be like crypto or covid all over again where prices just stay high because why not? A lot of people will still pay it. GPU prices never really came back down after crypto, they only got more expensive.",Negative
Intel,"They'll have to lower prices if people stop buying their products. Unlike high-end GPUs where its a dedicated product for a smaller userbase, flash memory is used in just about every tech product around. Hardcore gamers might be willing to pay inflated prices for their GPUs, but your average person won't be so willing to pay double for a new PC when they can just keep using their old one. And the last thing these manufactures want to do is sit on tons of stock that isn't selling and rapidly depreciates in value.",Negative
Intel,"I was just telling somebody the last time I upgraded my RAM was late 2022. I spent 84.99 (total) on two sticks of G.Skill DDR4 16GB 3600 from Newegg. Same exact kit now on Newegg is $254.99. That wasn’t even any kind of new hotness when I bought it, now it’s practically antiquated. $254.99. It’s scalper pricing.",Negative

With Windows 11 you’re also going to need 32GB of RAM and the cheapest no-name 32 GB kit (DDR4 2400 at that) is $120. We’ve already busted $800 and haven’t even looked at a CPU yet, let alone the rest of the PC.",Negative
Intel,"Its crazy to think that i bought my ddr5 2×16gb ram for roughly 110€ about 18 months ago, i feel incredibly lucky that i didnt wait any longer to finally build my first pc. On the other hand i also waited and slowly saved up for about 5-7 years, allways looking if there were good deals. One can only hope that times will get better soon. Im honestly worried that thr whole ai thing will not crash and we will have to wait a couple more years until things stabilise again in the electronics market.  Sometimes its worth checking local electronic shops, they sometimes have really good deals, noone knows about, because we young people order everything nowadays. I have seen some crazy deals on prebuilds for like 600-800€ down from 1.5k€",Positive
Intel,"Generally, your instincts are correct as prices usually go down. It's just crazy times we live in",Neutral
Intel,I bought a 1k pre built new with a 9060 16gb. Not sure of your expectations but it plays almost all games in high quality.,Positive
Intel,"Used PC's are banger deals if you're careful.   I sold a Ryzen 5700 system with a 2080 init for the price of the dang ram less than a month later. So yea, theres deals to be had.",Positive
Intel,Yes used is the way to go.,Neutral
Intel,"Are you in the USA? If so, might want to check local brick and mortar stores like Walmart or Staples. They sometimes have deals on parts that you can scrounge together. Or display units for prebuilts. Biggest price sinks right now are RAM, storage, and GPU.",Neutral
Intel,"As a teen, I would aways buy used parts because I was too impatient to save for newer parts.   I still do it to this day.  I've had a couple times where it did not turn out well for me but for the most part, if you are careful and fast enough, you will be able to score some really good deals.     I was recently able to build a pc with parts I got from a deal for a whole pc and some other listings I found for around 1800$CAD that easily would have cost about 2700 to 2800$ tax in new.",Neutral
Intel,I really wanted to finally get another PC to upgrade from an i5-7400 and 1050ti (my old one was from 2017 and I built it during the crypto ram price bubble) but parts got stupid expensive again. I seem to time it poorly every time.  Just bought a second hand rig for £470 with an i5-12400 and 3060ti. Seems to be playing everything on high/ultra super nicely so far! And not the end of the world if in a few years time I want to upgrade again! Though in my case probably another 8 years.,Negative
Intel,If you live near Microcenter it's not too bad. The used prices are kinda crazy right now.,Neutral
Intel,"You might find a good deal on a used PC, but they're also more expensive than normal,  and they might have undisclosed defects and expired warranty.  I haven't seen anybody mention it so I'll suggest you consider the upcoming Steam Machine, we should have some more info soon.",Negative
Intel,"I just bought one today after checking different options. I made part lists, tried builder sites, and looked at prebuilt. The used ones were cheapest but you might have fewer options on parts. Prebuilt is next cheapest, I was able to get a slightly better graphics card and processor with a prebuild over building my own for the same price, and that's not even counting shipping for ordering parts separately and having a warranty. I feel like right now a prebuilt is the best option. Or used/refurb if you find the right one.",Positive
Intel,Used is good but you really have to be careful and know exactly what youre getting. Make sure everything works,Neutral
Intel,"If you only want to game, your best option right now is to buy a PS5 (Pro), save the rest of your budget, and buy a new PC in a few years when prices have come down. A used PC will have a hard time beating a PS5 for the same price.",Neutral

Intel,"A bit out of my price range, even for a used one. I’m only 19 and I’m building this by myself with my own money as my first ever build. From where I’m from, the 3060 12 gb is a bit manageable price-wise, I just wanted to check out other options.",Neutral
Intel,"i remember hearing that the overhead issues are less of/not an issue now, due to driver updates",Neutral
Intel,[similar to a 3060ti](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-arc-b580/32.html) but with newer features,Neutral
Intel,Fair. If your on a tight budget. Consider some of the RDNA3 AMD cards as well. I mean if your looking at a 3 generation old 3060 anyway. Something like the 7600 XT 16gb might be on the market where you are at a good price. Its probably 20% or so faster then a 3060.,Positive
Intel,Have you checked the bios to make sure your ram is running at the correct speed?,Neutral
Intel,dlls/framegen?,Neutral
Intel,"If game is graphically intensive -> GPU usage goes up.  If CPU not able to provide enough frames to keep up with GPU -> CPU bottleneck, GPU usage unable to go up, stuck at X%.  If you play at 1080p, less graphically intensive, uses less of your GPU. If you play at 1440p, then naturally your GPU needs to work harder, so its usage is higher.  Looks like your setup is working as expected and you're cpu limited in arc raiders. Open task manager and under the performance tab, check if ram speed is running at 3200mhz. If it is, then you're probably just CPU limited.",Neutral
Intel,"What graphics settings? I get about the same at epic/high settings, dlss balanced, 1440p on a 5070ti and 12700k. Probably cpu bottleneck, idk",Neutral
Intel,You need to monitor your CPU usage,Neutral
Intel,"Just so we're on the same page, at 1080p you can expect the cpu to be working harder.",Neutral
Intel,"150-170 FPS seems just fine to me for a 4070. It's a previous generation mid-range card. See if there's something you can optimize in the options, sometimes stuff like shadows or reflections can greatly influence how a game runs.",Neutral
Intel,What power mode is your PC in? If it's in high performance mode it's not scheduling correctly because the scheduler in Windows will prioritize the cores with the higher clock speed rather than the ones with the higher cache.,Neutral
Intel,That isn’t going to cause a big issue like this. X3d chips are less reliant on ram speed than other Ryzen chips,Neutral
Intel,"For these tests I was running all low settings to see if fps would be better. Have tried no aa, and other settings to see if it would improve.",Neutral
Intel,Sounds good! Thank you!,Positive
Intel,Should I change it?,Neutral
Intel,"It's totally irrelevant in OP's case. He's got a 5700X3D, not a dual CCD X3D chip.",Negative
Intel,Yeah if graphics settings don't improve that's a dead giveaway that you're CPU limited,Negative
Intel,Yes you should set it to balanced,Neutral
Intel,Ok and from there the only option would just be to upgrade my cpu right,Neutral
Intel,Nothing to really upgrade to. Time for AM5.,Negative
Intel,"Check your GPU utilization in the game. If it's near 100%, then a GPU upgrade is the best option. But, I encourage you not to buy the RTX 3050. Try to get at least a 3060.",Neutral
Intel,Intel has GPUs for a while they got a pretty good budget option too (just some problems with it though) called the Intel arc b580. Anyways upgrading to AM5 is not viable as its Ramageddon so ram prices are horrendous rn. I recommend checking out the 5600xt or 5800XT CPU. As for the GPU try looking for a 9060xt 8gb or 16gb it's a pretty budget option that'll do you well. If you have a budget of around 200-300 get rtx 3060. Before all this though what's your PSU wattage,Neutral
Intel,"If you're open to getting used, might be able to upgrade both. Ryzen 5600 are ~100-120 USD used on Ebay or on Aliexpress (or look around for a local seller on Facebook Marketplace or /r/hardwareswap) and it drops right into your board to replace the 2600. Pair that with an Arc B580 (~250, maybe less used) and you've got a pretty solid setup.",Neutral
Intel,Why not find a decent 5000 series cpu and thenulgrade the gpu?,Neutral
Intel,What's your budget?,Neutral
Intel,"What is you max budget? Anyway, since the RAM price is pretty fcked nowadays, I recommend you to stay on AM4 platform and just upgrade the CPU instead of straight away go to AM5 or Intel DDR5 equivalent  Unless you can only afford 3050 or 1660 Super, you'd better with something like 3060 12GB or something else",Neutral
Intel,What speed is that RAM?,Neutral
Intel,"Keep the Ryzen 7 2700, B450 mb, 32g ram and get a GPU. You said the Intel B570 but for a little more you can get Intel B580 if your PSU and MB support it. You also said I5 14400 but then you would need another Motherboard.",Neutral
Intel,"hey brother I have the same build (except I use Strix X470-I Gaming mobo and 16GB RAM). I am upgrading to a 5700x, a 9060 XT 16GB and 64GB of RAM.",Neutral
Intel,"Any 5000-series CPU would be a *massive* upgrade, however… GPUs specifically will see massive price hikes & shortages in the next couple months. So it might actually be the last time you can snag a cheap used GPU.  Forget the 3050, a 3060Ti is an excellent value under $200. If you can find a 12GB version, you’ll be especially glad you did. I’d recommend a 4060 for the same price range, but your motherboard is most likely PCI gen 3, so a 30-series card is your best bet. With the latest DLSS updates, I’d personally stick with RTX, especially with a lower-power card.",Positive
Intel,That or finding the best priced used 30 series card.,Neutral
Intel,600 watts,Neutral
Intel,3060 ti is sub $200 used. Not a bad upgrade. He can get a used 6800 (non XT) for sub $300,Positive

Intel,Thank you! :D,Positive
Intel,"You couldn't really have picked a worse time to upgrade then. If you really want though, the MC bundles look at least acceptable given the situation. The prebuilt route could also work, but definitely not with a 8700F which is barely an upgrade (if any) to the 5600X in gaming. Honestly i'd just let it go for now.",Neutral
Intel,5600x is still good. The 4070 is still good. Sell your 16gb of ram and buy a 32gb kit. I would rock this setup until prices aren’t ridiculous.,Positive
Intel,"[There's no way the 5600x is bottlenecking your system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RijAyVshtok) unless you're playing at 1080p. If so, just get more ram and a 1440p monitor, then your 4070 will be doing more heavy lifting over the cpu, and you'll get a huge jump in graphical fidelity :)  i say this only because prices are nuts, and you'll be spending lots and lots of money for just not that much performance increase.  Edit: If we watch the performance for [BF6 ](https://youtu.be/RijAyVshtok?si=zcS0W5laSZ6tPgSv&t=202)and [Arc Raiders](https://youtu.be/RijAyVshtok?si=PQ-s1sfGXjY7KBbh&t=235), the 5600x still holds up quite well",Neutral
Intel,I did 5600X to 5800X3D when it was a relatively affordable option and it wasn’t a massive upgrade given the lower clock speeds of the X3D chip.  With PBO enabled on the 5600X it should be fine for gaming in 1440p.  A bump up to 32GB would be beneficial.  Otherwise that’s a fine system with the 4070.,Neutral

Intel,Personally havent seen my 5600x be a bottleneck for my 5070 GPU @ 1440p gaming,Neutral
Intel,"Yup i get ~120 fps on ultra in BF6 with a 5070ti, 5600x and 32gb ram",Positive
Intel,I have a 9060 xt 16 gig and a 5600x with 16 gigs of 3600 mhz ram.  I get poor 1% lows running most settings on high.  My fps is around 110-130 but stuttering is an issue.  Capped my fps at 90 and that helps but definitely feel like an upgrade would help.,Negative
Intel,"Im on a prebuild from 2022? I forget what year. ASUS PRIME B550M-A AC  For you if you havent bought a CPU yet, I'd consider getting one of the lower end AM5 CPUs instead of the 5 5600X, that way upgrading later will be easier since you wont have to change the motherboard later.",Neutral
Intel,Just grabbed the 7800x3d bundle myself for a new build. Insane deal,Positive
Intel,BF6 has been the primary culprit for me. Arc Raiders kind of but to a lesser degree.,Negative
Intel,This is good to hear. I have a 5600x and just ordered a 5070TI. My only issue is I waited to long to upgrade ram and only have 16gb…,Positive
Intel,"If it was with a 5500 or other 16mb l3 cache CPU I'd be inclined to blame it, but very odd to see stuttering attributed to the 5600x and not something like verifying ram profile, reinstalling drivers, or perhaps a little PBO + curve optimizer couldn't fix  Playing at 1080p?",Negative
Intel,yeah with current pricing you are almost getting the 7800x3d for free with that bundle. MC is the goat for a very good reason.,Positive
Intel,I bought 16gb more of the same ram off ebay for like $80. Good luck.,Positive
Intel,1440 and have tried all of the above.  Specifically when I get near the fire line in bf6 redsec I get a lot of issues and my guess is the volumetric rendering of fire and smoke is CPU intensive.  My fps doesn't drop too bad but I get stutters and frame drops I can only assume are bad 1% lows.  Really wish javelin anti cheat didn't block third party software from capturing frame data.  Even amd adrenaline can't monitor my frame data.,Negative
Intel,Good idea! Thanks. No issues running 4 ram sticks?,Positive

Just trying to help ya find an alternate solution since an AM5 upgrade is so darn expensive.",Neutral
Intel,Not yet!,Neutral
Intel,I'll look into afterburner and riva I have them installed just haven't set it up.  I recently did a clean os install when I upgraded to my 9060xt.  Definitely run my system with no other windows open and have gone through a couple guides on optimum settings (both game and my windows/bios).  The game runs smooth with an fps limiter of 90.  Tried undervolting to give pbo some more room to push boost clocks and have process lasso installed with the game and anticheat set to priority.,Neutral

Intel,"It is not, horizontal w/ a support bracket.",Neutral
Intel,The clean windows install I did twice would’ve had the same effect.,Neutral
Intel,Interesting as that’s the first I’m hearing of it. Is there any sensor I could poll to see and confirm that?      Interestingly I was wondering if the VRMs were overheating so I tried to kill and restart furmark in rapid succession to see if I could get it to throttle right away and it’d always clock to 570+ before throttling.,Neutral
Intel,Got any links for this issue? Trying to find and can’t,Negative
Intel,I would personally recommend a small UPS system to protect your investment!,Positive
Intel,You are seeing the bottleneck because your GPU is vastly more powerful than your CPU.   Not sure what Mobo you have but you might need to upgrade that to get to a more powerful CPU.,Neutral
Intel,"Congrats on the 5070!  Definitely time to upgrade the cpu. Take a look at Newegg or your preferred website for some mobo/cpu bundles. Definitely would pair well with a 9000 series ryzen but since you have ddr4 ram, and ram cost way way way too much. Maybe get the 5800X3D with an AM4 mobo.",Positive
Intel,"LGA1700 DDR4 board and a 12th gen i5/i7 or 13th/14th gen i5. If you can get a 12600K and a new motherboard, you wouldn't need to buy RAM which is more expensive than just a Mobo/CPU combo.",Neutral
Intel,Yes,Positive
Intel,thanks for the help! i’ll look into them,Positive
Intel,i’m not sure if this helps but i have 64 gigs of RAM. at least that’s what it says when i look on task manager lol. this also originally wasn’t my pc i bought it off a buddy and he bought it prebuilt but since have swapped some parts off for custom ones. so i know my pc is kind of a weird build. but if i have that should i still try the 9000 series?,Neutral
Intel,thanks for the suggestion! i’ll def look into that for sure!,Positive

Intel,Unless youre trying to get into 4k gaming you probably dont need an upgrade. In what way are you falling behind on performance?,Neutral
Intel,"Whats fallibg behind, cpu or gpu? Check the % usage when you play your games.",Neutral
Intel,"Definitely depends on your budget, but if you play games at higher resolutions, a GPU upgrade would be a good start. It can be quite expensive for a suitable upgrade though - Something like a 9070 XT starts at $700ish, which is a lot for a normal person.  Also, if you're one of the 3 people who live close to a microcenter, they have pretty good deals on AM5 CPU/Board/Ram combos. If you play especially CPU-heavy games that would be my go-to.  No matter what path you take, it will probably be kind of expensive. You have a good build as it sits, so really you're looking at some VERY high end components as upgrades.  With that being said, it's probably a good idea to buy sooner rather than later. Market for PC parts is already pretty bad, and things won't get any better.",Neutral
Intel,"A good GPU such as a 5070 Ti is going to provide the most benefit, the drawback is the cost. Unfortunately, it’s a terrible time to do an upgrade bc of the AI bubble. If you don’t have plenty of money to spend, you might want to wait for a year or two, when hopefully things will be much better, and next-generation parts will be out... but ofc there’s a chance the AI bubble won’t have popped and prices will be even worse.",Negative
Intel,Is your non standard memory config maybe causing gaming issues. Your only really  meaningful upgrade would be a 2 grand GPU as a gaming upgrade without changing everything.,Negative
Intel,What sort of games do you play?,Neutral

Intel,"your pc is literally fine lol. what games are you playing that a 5600x and 3070 can't handle? unless you're trying to do 4k ultra on like starfield, you're probably just needing to turn down some settings",Neutral
Intel,Upgrade to 4070ti it's fairly cheap and will show the most value with your system.,Positive
Intel,"Agree, if you must spend money get more storage",Neutral
Intel,I havent checked what exactly is falling behind but on arc raiders for example i get to 100 fps max and thats after optimizing settings and dlss on balanced,Neutral
Intel,It shouldnt. i did some testing and everythings fine as far as i know,Neutral
Intel,"Pretty much everything but right now where i noticed poor performance is in arc raiders, after optimizing settings i get 100 fps max and thats on dlss on balanced",Negative
Intel,Cant hit 144 fps on arc raiders with optimized settings and dlss on balanced. Idc for 144 fps but in shooters its pretty important,Neutral
Intel,Are you experiencing things in game that impact play? You don't need 100 FPS to play a game.,Neutral
Intel,"cpu then, cpu is a lot more important for these sort of games especially on lower settings",Neutral
Intel,Frames are pretty consistent from what i could tell. I know i dont need it but its a pvp shooter and i dont have 144hz for nothing. I dont mind playing at 60 for singleplayer or pve games but i cant do it in shooters,Neutral
Intel,you could the say the same about wanting to play at 1440p or higher settings lmao,Neutral
Intel,"You have enough ram and storage for 2 gaming rigs and that processor is pretty solid. I'd start with a more modern 16GB graphics card, but youre going to pay a lot for it.    When I get competitive in games I usually end up turning the graphics down so I can see what's going on more easily. Theres a few I play on the absolute lowest settings.",Positive
Intel,What are you trying to say with this? I just asked because they didn't give specifics on what's wrong with performance.,Negative
Intel,"It's pretty obvious want I'm trying to say, he says he wants more than 100 fps you are saying that's good enough, which is a pretty fucking dumb thing to say, some people want more fps some people want better graphics",Negative
Intel,"Ok. That was not obvious to me. They answered the question and I gave them my suggestion on the upgrade, im not sure what youre upset about.",Neutral

Intel,5060 is faster for arc raiders natively and considering the feature advantage I would def go for it.  Although keep in mind if you go over the 8gb vram limit the 9060 xt will handle that better and is faster on average just not in arc raiders,Positive
Intel,Get the 5060! It has a better feature set like better upscaling and better Ray Tracing! You also don't have to deal with crappy AMD drivers which I have experienced and many AMD RX 9000 series users are also experiencing! You have better peace of mind with the Nvidia GPU!,Positive

Intel,"The 9060XT is the stronger card. At 1080p don't even think about the 16Gb. Traditionally, AMD updates their cards and the performance grows more and more over time.

Intel,"Yes, that still seems to be the consensus very much. Better upscaling and drivers.",Positive
Intel,"The 5060 Ti 16 GB is ~$630 here. Think the 9070 (non xt) would give better performance for that price range ($650 where I live). The pricing ladder in my market, I tell you! 😅",Neutral
Intel,I own one buddy. I have never had a single issue with my 9070xt. The only people posting to this subreddits are people having issues that the overwhelming majority of people do not have. It’s biased by the nature of what it is .   If amd gpus had driver issues you would see big publications talking about them but you don’t. You are propagating a myth.  You’re also conveniently ignoring the disastrous 50 series launch drivers for NVIDIA.,Negative
Intel,"Curious - in what kind of situations does the 5060 run into vram limitations in your experience with it? If I play something like Arc Raiders at 1080p at high (second highest), would I ""run out of vram?""   I'm afraid I still don't understand how that works entirely. Have you had such instances with the 5060?",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, but super hard/rare to come by. They get snagged up pretty fast too.",Negative
Intel,"Yep. $200 difference between the cheapest variants of both here in India. If it were a $50 difference, I wouldn't have even made this post.",Neutral
Intel,https://youtu.be/xlbNsP5ySmA?si=XowPsOGMbrnOX1aD  You can watch this video to convince yourself,Neutral
Intel,Yes he is interested in using his 4k TV at lower settings and framerate. It will not be playable with a 8gb gpu.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah i also moved to nvidia even though it is not allways the best price for performance because my last 2 AMD cards ( 5700xt and 6650xt ) could not run God Of War at all no matter the video settings or resolution, the game kept dropping to 30 fps, and it is a common issue with Amd and god of war games and they still have not fixed it.  There are more issues like this, some are fixable if you google the solution, some are not and after the thing with god of war i decided to give up on amd for now, they also didnt add FSR4 to previous gen GPU s ( like the 7000 series) , while Nvidia gave DLSS 4.5 even to the first RTX cards.",Negative
Intel,Then stick to 5060! For almost double the price it is not worth it!,Negative
Intel,You are welcome to make your assumptions and share your own experience but I can only speak based on my experience with them and what I observe from my reddit scrolls! I switched to the Green Side and won't be going for a new Radeon GPU anytime soon.,Neutral
Intel,"You can play Arc Raider at max settings and you wont run out of Vram, personally  i never ran out of vram because i dont allways play the latest games ( i play at 1080p )  In the Game Indiana Jones ( which is a very bad optimised game )you have to set the settings to medium to not run out of vram and i think in the new Doom you have to use high, thats it, in some future released games you might have to use high/medium instead of ultra.  When you run out of vram the game gets very bad frame drops.  I play Cyberpunk on a mix of high and very high i think and i dont have any issues with vram for example, same for BF6.  At 4k resolution the vram issues appear in newer titles",Neutral
Intel,At 1080p you will almost never run into a VRAM issue and Nvidia cards are also more efficient in VRAM utilisation! They are also much more power efficient i.e. they will consume less power for the same level of performance which saves some electricity while also giving your power supply more headroom!,Positive
Intel,Can you go find a 5700xt and run that until you've saved for a  16GB card?  If you ever wanna move to the TV or even a better monitor 8GB is gonna be out gunned real fast.,Neutral
Intel,"Oh right yeah 😅  I don’t even own a TV, that wouldn’t cross my mind.",Neutral
Intel,"Haha what, more power efficient?",Positive
Intel,Not available here. What about a 7700xt for ~$380 (vs 9060xt 16gb @~$500) or a 7600 xt for $270 vs (5060 @~$500)?  Used market is not ideal here. They're either overpriced or they get snapped up in minutes.,Negative
Intel,"Regardless, the 8gb models on some modern games run out of VRAM at 1080p. I assume most spend hundreds of euros to have a useful product for several years, not just a single.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah true, that’s why I grabbed a 5060 Ti 16 GB last month myself :’) But also I didn’t wanna downgrade in vram from my 3060 12 GB.",Positive
Intel,"Sigh, how I wish I could get a 5060 ti. That's ~$600 here. How about a 7700xt for ~$380? (Keep in mind the 9060 16gb is $500 here)?",Negative
Intel,Well you could use Optiscaler to get FSR 4 on older Radeon cards and the 7700 XT comes with 12 GB of VRAM which is definitely better than 8 GB. I don’t see why not.,Positive
Intel,"They're same thing, I don't even see point of pro tbh unless you need it for some reason.  The difference is Intel vPro® Essentials & Intel SIPP (Stable Image Platform Program) that basically it.",Neutral
Intel,I think one of the key differences is that one has the word Pro in it while the other doesnt,Neutral
Intel,the difference is money. if you ask intel they'll answer you with that:  https://preview.redd.it/mbnrjbrwy1gg1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d19e620addc72804f671b1c9706b6e77f93f7b0,Neutral
Intel,"The real answer is that it supports a different driver suite, and probably will have better support for photoshop and other softwares.",Positive
Intel,I love the krabs meme,Positive
Intel,Get a 9060xt 16 GB or a b580 before even thinking of getting a shitass 8GB card.,Negative
Intel,"If you pay about half the price for a B580 than you would a 5060 8GB, the deal is super solid. For the same price, 5060/9060. B580s used to be around (for me locally) €250 and that was quite a solid price for them, but €300+ feels a bit stiff.",Positive
Intel,"If you can afford it get 9060XT 16GB, if you can't get a used 2080ti",Neutral
Intel,"it depends on how you play games  roughly speaking if vram usage < 8gb, 5060 is slightly faster than b580  resolution, image quality setting, upscaling setting, etc, affect how much vram are required",Neutral
Intel,Get an AMD 9060XT over some Intel junk.,Neutral
Intel,If Intel Drivers were decent...,Neutral
Intel,It's 4060 level card and might even be 3060 level in some games.,Neutral
Intel,What do you think is the difference between the 9060XT 8GB and the regular 9060?,Neutral
Intel,"Except they are, haven't had any issues in the months that I've used my card.",Neutral
Intel,You can't buy a regular 9060,Negative
Intel,"There were games that weren't playable for days unless Intel released a Driver Update, they also had a massive Driver Overhead with lower-end CPUs, although this one was fixed from what I heard, but idk if 100% fixed.  If they fixed all of this stuff, then they already have better Drivers than AMD.",Negative
Intel,?,Neutral
Intel,#You can't buy a regular 9060,Negative
Intel,Why?,Neutral
Intel,Try to buy it,Neutral
Intel,"Why are you doing this instead of explaining properly? If you mean I can't find it, then I can find an RX 9060 in the country where I live.",Negative
Intel,"It means that there is no 9060, there is only 9060xt, with 8 or 16 GBs of vram.",Neutral
Intel,"It does not exist. You're asking about something which does not exist. There was one proposed model, shared between Asus and Asrock, but note from your link there are no reviews.  It appears AMD chose not to release the 9060 configuration of Navi 44.",Negative
Intel,https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-9060.c4326  so you're saying this is fake?,Negative
Intel,"Hello :) Intel Arc isn’t the same as Iris Xe. Arc is newer, and it’s usually noticeably better for graphics.  Out of these three, I’d pick the **HP ProBook (Core Ultra + Arc)**, it’s the most “future proof” option, and ProBooks are generally better built. About the HP hinge issue, it’s mostly a problem on some cheaper consumer models, it can still happen, but ProBooks are usually a safer bet. If you want the simplest “no worries” specs out of the box, the **MSI** is also a solid choice because it already has **16GB RAM and 1TB storage**.",Positive
Intel,Thanks man ;),Positive
Intel,you must have some huge hands judging from the apparent size of that box,Neutral

Intel,"That’s not a bad build for your needs whatsoever. You will struggle to reach 240fps in anything outside of GD, but I’m guessing that’s why you got the monitor. You will be able to play most modern games at 1080p 60FPS, setting obviously won’t be perfect. Editing may be a bit laggy though",Neutral
Intel,"If it works and you’re complacent with your gaming sessions, no need to upgrade. Once something starts to slow down (esp when you optimize your pc) then maybe start upgrading.",Neutral
Intel,"CPU, perhaps more ram if you're already maxing it out.",Neutral
Intel,That cpu needs to be upgraded,Negative
Intel,CPU w/o knowing use-case,Neutral
Intel,Ha... haha.... ha.... imagine being able to buy RAM right now for a fair price...,Neutral
Intel,What CPU do you have in mind? Preferably LGA1700 still.,Neutral
Intel,"Would probably have to be a matching kit because buying a new set of 32gb would get expensive. Just a question of if he has 1x16gb or 2x8gb and whether the motherboard has enough slots if OP has 2x8gb.  another 16gb of similar DDR4 probably runs like $60-80 on ebay. Maybe not needed, maybe it's vital.",Neutral
Intel,13500f is a pretty decent deal. Basically a 12600k with 4 more E cores but can be had for cheaper.,Positive
Intel,"If you can, definitely the 9060xt 16gb.",Neutral
Intel,Sadly 9060 XTs are almost $200 more   Edit: Okay maybe not,Negative
Intel,The cheapest 9060 XT 16gb cards at Microcenter and on Newegg are $400+,Neutral
Intel,"Better gpu,",Positive
Intel,You got a bit of headroom on that 12400,Neutral
Intel,"I basically had this exact set up, except I had a i7-10700f and I feel like I was getting a bit better frames (90-120). That was like a month ago so honestly I don’t remember. I was also playing 1440p low settings on a 4k monitor.  When I upgraded I kind of went all out and went with new am5 setup.  MOBO: gigabyte b650m gaming plus WiFi (budget MOBO)  CPU: Ryzen 5 9600x  GPU: gigabyte 9070xt oc  RAM: g.skill 32gb DDR5 6000mhz  I also had to upgrade my PSU. Went from Chinese 650w to a Corsair 850w.  And new cpu cooler, master cooler halo or something. (Air cooled) kept my old case.  I got my ram, mobo and gpu all from facebook marketplace. All brand new unopened, but it took me a while to gather all the parts. I was not trying to spend full price on anything.  Right now I play 4k max settings and get 250-300 fps with frame gen on. The game has gotten so much more enjoyable, it’s not even funny. Everything is just so beautiful and smooth.  https://preview.redd.it/obu527cq0rfg1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4470b56640b2eee442d76b2ffe26cb5a12bd9bac",Neutral
Intel,7700 XT or 9060 XT ?,Neutral
Intel,That’s what I figured too. Seems like VRAM is the bigger issue,Neutral
Intel,"Damn, that’s really nice! Yeah I guess I do get 90 sometimes but never 120 consistent. Right now I’m using anti lag + frame regeneration so it’s not too bad since I can get 200fps on that(just lower picture quality.   I just don’t know much how only upgrading my GPU would do   Thanks for the spec list. Honestly might consider a full upgrade depending on prices. I bet that 9070 XT was pricy for sure",Positive
Intel,"Well, those two cost slightly differently. If you go for 9060 XT, make sure it's 16 GB version.",Neutral
Intel,9060 XT 16GB what settings are you running it at I'm pretty sure even a Steam Deck can run Arc Raiders,Neutral
Intel,"Got the 9070xt for $625 brand new unopened on facebook mp lol. And yeah, just the gpu is not going to do much. Maybe 15-30 fps which isn’t bad but that’s a strong maybe.   Let’s just say you get a 9070xt you’re going to need to upgrade your PSU. And if you keep your current CPU, you’re going be bottle necked. So then you’ll need to upgrade that. One thing leads to another you’ve spent damn near a grand so might as well just upgrade to a newer platform and throw everything at it so it’s future proofed 😂. And just so you know, my whole upgrade stated from just wanting to get a better MOBO lol 😂 and look where I am now.",Negative
Intel,"Gaming was never doomed, but yes, those minimum specs are quite impressive for a game that looks the way it does.",Positive
Intel,might be even a good thing on some level ... nvidia tooting their horn proudly that they would unload old 3060s with only 8gb instead of more 50s gen kinda means stuff finally has to be better optimized..cause otherwise sales for games would decline (why buy smth that barely works on your pc after all),Neutral
Intel,Well damn. I've got a GTX 1650 laptop set aside. Might have to put this to the test.,Neutral
Intel,Horizon 4 & 5 were quite good optimized for my older PC .. i reckon they will be using same engine for 6 so performance should be alright  Only Forza i had problems before was 3 but that was when i had GTX 1650,Positive
Intel,"Same as the last game, I imagine this will be one of the flagship Xbox/Gamepass games. They want it to look good and still pull 60fps even on the Series S, so budget PC gamers get to benefit from that also.",Positive
Intel,the forza horizon´s I played where allways good to me,Positive
Intel,"To be fair, most gaming companies will have to now invest into optimizing their games, especially giants like CDPR or Rockstar, because what everyone have bought the past year - that's it for the next 2-3 years. Apart from new gen CPUs, there wont be more GPUs coming our way for a while and even when they do come, raw-power wise we will prob get like 10% more, but new DLSS 6.7 will give us 10 x fake frames. Not that DLSS or DLAA is bad, on the opposite, it's quite nice, but yeah.  Like Witcher 4 and Cyberpunk 2 will seriously need to optimize and honestly, I can't see Cyberpunk 2 or Witcher 4 require more than Cyberpunk2077 does, because like, what else can you do graphics wise? The game's almost photo-realistic as it is. There's literally no point.  That said, almost all AAA games are UE5 slop, which runs like a bitch.",Neutral
Intel,"Slightly sad with the CPU requirements, but given that those parts are 10 years old it makes sense.   4gb VRAM requirement is awesome though. Looks like it's going to be 1080p ultra for me and my 3070 ti!",Positive
Intel,"Gaming was never doomed.  AAA gaming was unsustainable years ago.  Nobody knows what ""optimization"" is or requires.",Negative
Intel,"This has to run on Xbox Series S. Do you know what CPU and GPU it’s comparable to?  It’s simple math, use your brain.",Neutral
Intel,"Say it with me: JUST BECAUSE IT RUNS ON WEAK HARDWARE DOESN'T MEAN IT'S OPTIMIZED.  seriously, people here don't udnerstand what this work means and think ""high fps = optimized""  >and if anyone saw the trailer, you'd know that it looks to be graphic intensive.  You don't know how it looks on lowest settings, also I don't think it looks that great.",Negative
Intel,"Horizon’s didn’t perform terrible, when they worked. The sheer amount of crashes 4 threw my way as soon as 5 came out actually made me not buy 5.",Negative
Intel,"I said a while back here on Reddit that game devs will see the PC parts crisis thats happening for the next 3 years and it would be incredibly stupid to release a game nobody can play, so optimisation will be a serious focus for any upcoming games. People told me that this would take years to adjust to... I dont believe it",Negative
Intel,Arent TW4 and CP2077 moving to UE5?  edit: yes. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nthv4xF\_zHU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nthv4xF_zHU),Neutral
Intel,That's why you don't pre-order or buy at release.   I've never had either game crash on my system as far as I remember.,Neutral
Intel,that recommendation like the others is for the system itself and not whats required for the game.,Negative
Intel,about damn time innit?  i mean i got pretty good hardware but man ...ive been a gamer for sooo long and the increase in quality of graphics is definetly happening over time ..but if you compare it with the increase of performance of hardware needed to run said games... what a joke sometimes the requirements are!  i secretly suspect companies like nvidia sabotage the optimizations as well ..to ensure people keep yearning for more and more gpu power.... bit like apple with the stories of artificial battery degradation and so on you know?,Negative
Intel,"Yes of course, It's been known for a long time. Not only that, TW4 and CP2077 are supposedly ""core"" games in UE5 development too.   It genuinely sucks though. Redengine was amazing, flawed, but amazing.",Negative
Intel,Isn't Arc Raiders UE5? Lol,Neutral
Intel,"Hitching or stuttering in most games is a sign that the GPU can't find enough work to stay busy.  The GPU may be running low on VRAM, depending on your settings you might be coming close to what 12 GB can do.  The CPU could be being distracted by any number of background tasks. Windows is pretty good at keeping out of the way, but anything else isn't. Is Discord updating? A browser still open? Even minimised tasks are still fully running. If the CPU's doing those things, it isn't keeping data flying at the GPU.  If those tasks aren't using CPU, they could still be using RAM. 32 GB should be enough, but check what RAM usage is like in the game. If you go north of 25 GB, this is going to be the problem.",Negative
Intel,"Yes, meaning?",Neutral
Intel,"*Hitching or stuttering in most games is a sign that the GPU can't find enough work to stay busy.*   So do you think when I'm able to run in 1440p this could resolve the hitching?  *The CPU could be being distracted by any number of background tasks. Windows is pretty good at keeping out of the way, but anything else isn't. Is Discord updating? A browser still open? Even minimised tasks are still fully running.*   I close all background apps. I don't even have discord running or a browser open. Checked and turned off any game overlays as well. Before I got a 5060ti, I was running a 3060ti (8gb) and it was the same then so makes me think it's nothing to do with the GPU or VRAM.   *If those tasks aren't using CPU, they could still be using RAM. 32 GB should be enough, but check what RAM usage is like in the game. If you go north of 25 GB, this is going to be the problem.*   I'll check this out but as stated above, I have nothing running in the background so can't see it being this.

Intel,"I see, I kind of thought it must be down to the games optimisation itself or as you say due to the engine its running on but having a quick search online, a lot of people seem to think the game runs flawlessly. The game is playable as its just every now and again there's a hitch but it sure is annoying!",Negative
Intel,"Yep, I did do that on my 3060ti but I don't think I ever played Arc on it. Do you play arc at all and do you notice any hitching/transition stutter as Churchillian mentions above?",Neutral
Intel,"Idk, I've heard Arc Raider is supposed to be relatively optimized for a UE5 game but pretty much every UE5 game I've played has the transition stutter issue.   If you play enough games on UE4/5 engine you kind of get used to it.",Negative
Intel,"I play it, I don't experience any of this. If the developer hasn't hidden a loading segment very well (""transition stutter"") then sure, any game will have to pause while it loads up the data, but I don't see that in Arc Raiders.",Negative
Intel,"Yeah, I've got nearly 100 hours in the game, it's just that I recently upgraded my card and hoped that this would iron out the hitching but it still remains.",Neutral
Intel,Yeah it's just an engine thing and I think it's been around since UE3?   Epic's own game fortnight has stutter problems still so it doesn't seem like it's something they can/want to fix anytime soon.,Negative
Intel,"Yep, I remember playing that years ago and it had stuttering issues for me. Its strange as it doesn't seem like everybody experiences this. PC's ey! You never know what it could be related to.

Intel,No c po aweonao,Neutral
Intel,"If you aren't overheating, and since you swapped Power Supplies, assuming other components aren't the issue which I would doubt, I would say to get a Uninterruptible Power Supply to make sure you get stable power from the wall.     You could try moving your PC to a different outlet or circuit to test.  Could be as simple as a loose cable in the wall, outlet not as tight, or something like a fast brownout if something causes a voltage drop hence PC turning off.",Neutral
Intel,If your CPU is spiking to 90c I would re-paste the CPU cooler. That dual fan cooler should have no problem keeping up. I bet you have a hot spot that's got an air bubble causing that spike. And I bet when your PC shuts off the spike is jumping over 100c,Neutral
Intel,"HI!, yeah sorry i forgot to mention that i also bought one just to make sure the power outages didnt ruin something",Neutral
Intel,thats what i though too thats why i changed the artic mx4 for mx6,Neutral
Intel,"That's very strange, that cooler should have no problem keeping up with that CPU. You should test it with Cinebench. Under a Cinebench load you should max out around 88 unless there is an airflow issue in the case. If your PC restarts running Cinebench you've got an airflow or cooler seating issue. If it handles the Cinebench load you've got another issue that might be harder to troubleshoot.    I'm assuming both CPU fans are blowing back towards the rear of the case? And your rear fan and top fans are both blowing outwards not inwards? If not configure them as such and see if that helps as well",Neutral
Intel,"i´ll try the cinebench. The fans are exactly as you mentioned, both bottom fans are getting air in, there´s only one on top cause of the limited space and the 8pin for the cpu didnt let me set correctly the other fan, that one is getting the air out and the rear one i also extracting air.

Cheaper, will cool maybe even better than the AIO given it's open air and won't be close to failing and borking your shit maybe like a second hand AIO. Although that does maybe look like that 1 cooler with a mosfet fan or whatever it is, which again seems somewhat useless given it's an open air case.",Neutral

Intel,People will pay the price so it’ll keep getting worse. It’ll be 5-7 years before ram manufacturers can make another foundry to keep up with the demand and then prices will stay the same so they can recoup the billions spent to make the new factory.

Intel,"I'm doing great! I have spare DDR5 RAM, a spare 4090, a spare 9700x, a spare X870 Mobo, a spare 9070xt. I just ordered a new lga1200 Mobo for my server rig as a backup. I'm in a good place.",Positive
Intel,Upgraded to AM5 this past July. Will have to survive with 32GB and 4080 for the next foreseeable number of years.,Neutral
Intel,"Really glad I built a new PC in June the only annoying thing was I only got 32GB of RAM planning to upgrade to 64 later, that's not going to happen. I gave my old PC to my partner, it has a 2080 so it's still ok enough to play the games she likes. I had to buy a new SSD for it because I had moved the SSD with my steam library to the new PC so it was left with a 250 boot drive and a slow 4TB hard drive. I paid more for a 1TB drive than I did for a 2tb 4 months ago but looks like they're even more now.",Positive

Intel,"It'll still be getting security updates until something like 2028, it just won't be getting any more ""Game Ready"" updates. Which isn't a total loss since the kind of games that receive those updates are going to keep running increasingly poorly on older cards and are probably not going to be worth playing anyway.",Negative
Intel,That’s still ~9 years of support for game related updates.  AMD didn’t even give me 4 with the 6950 XT,Neutral
Intel,I'll believe them (either Intel or AMD) when I see the benchmarks.  Until then this is all just pointless noise.,Neutral
Intel,well yeah you can't compare them because strix halo is on a signficantly larger die wheras panther lake is more comparable to something like the hx370.   If amd is able to get strix halo at a competitive price then sure it will compete but the issue is that with such a large die I don't think it is possible for them to compete in price with panther lake,Neutral
Intel,I’ll never understand why AMD is not committing to design RDNA4 based APUs and at this point I just take RDNA 3.5 as a joke because they can’t even support FSR4 on it officially nor the RX 7000 cards.  It’s like they are losing on purpose,Negative
Intel,"AMD has this “it’s good enough for a while and we’ll release something great that people will forget this happened”  Vega lasted in mobile for nearly 5 years and got RDNA2 designs. Now, it’s RDNA3.5 being built for mobile platform and betting on that to be good enough until RDNA5/UDNA bridge die designs releases (unverified rumor)  AMD also has this weird obsession with competitor naming. Sure, it’s meant to confuse buyers but it’s hurting them than helping, maybe it does help in terms of inventory.  They’re not intel-like of stagnation. They’re competing but not for us in the consumer market and we’re just getting scraps until enterprise trend die down (currently AI trend/bubble).  Well, it’s understandable as Zen designs are really focused in Epyc and scale down to Ryzen SKUs.  And the 400 series is a bad refresh when Ryzen 6000 mobile is the definitive refresh they have done, Zen 3+ and move to RDNA2. AMD could’ve done similar commitment but it’s not currently.  Also, AMD forgor Strix Halo laptops are still nowhere to be found aside from 1 or 2",Neutral

Yes, the 8060S & 8050s can be found in some laptops, but for the laptops you'll find in places like Currys, Best Buy or Mediamarkt, the B390 will be the most powerful iGPU you'll likely find & it'll happily outdo a Radeon 890M",Positive
Intel,"AMD is at the point where Intel was before they went down the route and are recovering, history repeats before it's too late.  Not going to believe either until we get actual benchmarks and results.",Negative
Intel,Meanwhile AMD keeps putting out new chips with years old GPUs.,Neutral
Intel,Core Ultra 2 is already a better mobile soc.  I don't know why AMD thinks 12-16 cores is more important than battery life when it comes to laptops.,Neutral
Intel,The Intel igpu has a better upscaler by far. FSR3.1 is a third class competitor in comparison. People have been crying out for AMD to release FSR4 for RDNA3.5 but AMD has some seriously stupid execs in charge.,Negative

Intel,"strix halo is nice and all, but too prohibitively expensive to be considered for many people  arc b390/b370 will be available in much cheaper products for which amd doesn't have a proper answer to atm. amd's next lineup can't be lazy if they want to stay competitive",Negative
Intel,"The GPU doesn't matter if you don't have proper drivers and they are so far behind still Intel.   Great progress, but the drivers are still going to be the thing that makes people say no.   If intel keeps on chugging away and they work with all the DirectX games backwards and going forward.   I'm talking past DirectX games, you can't just worry about the new games there's games that are older that don't run well.   It took AMD many many years to get decent drivers, Intel I don't know if they're just focusing on hardware and not the drivers, but that so far is what's been holding it back.   Hopefully they can release a true dedicated GPU back in rival something that's out there at a much better price that will bring at least some competition back until the AI scam is over.",Negative
Intel,Panther Lake is using a superior process technology. So they are right. But it doesn't matter as customer will choose what's better. But until AMD has something out that uses 2nm then yes they will be behind probably,Neutral
Intel,I hope Intel stays competitive and AMD also brings its best to the table.,Positive
Intel,They should be worried about DLSS 4.5 though. Fix stuttering on FSR 4 and improve image quality,Neutral
Intel,I just wish Intel would make a very cut down panther lake offering to be the successor to the N1xx/N3xx line of efficient chips that have found their way into mini PCs.,Neutral
Intel,amd unfazed? I bet they are talking big shit again then will get absolutely demolished (as it happened with vega too),Negative
Intel,"Yeah it's old architechture, that's the point, Intel moved to the lastest node and barely manages to eek out a win. A win is a win nonetheless, but AMD still have plenty to dials to turn up.",Neutral
Intel,"I don't understand the fuss about iGPUs? Like why do they assume the average Joe would care about an IGPU at all? That's maybe 5% of the market and even then...most of them would get a dGPU anyways.  And apart from the GPU, what's special about the CPU? Combining (Lunar Lake) efficiency with (Arrow Lake) power? Sorry but my Ryzen AI 7 350 does that already. The top of the line x9 388h is about ~10% faster in single core aka the only thing that matters and will probably be in 2500€+ laptops whereas my 7 350 is in 500€ laptops.  I tried a 285h laptop besides the AI 7 350 and not only did it run hotter and less efficient, it also felt less snappier.    And the AI 7 350 was designed as a Lunar Lake competitor anyways so it was never worse in efficiency and ahead of Arrow Lakes like the 255h in that regard.  So I don't see why anything should really change...?",Negative
Intel,"AMD doesn't want to bring RDNA 4 to APUs, so as not to give FSR4 to users other than those with dedicated GPUs.",Neutral
Intel,a brand new product on a newer node is better than an older product on an older node?! who knew?,Positive
Intel,"And the price. I used to be an AMD fan, but as soon as competition with Intel was gone, AMD raised their prices and now act as if they believe they are a luxury brand. Hope Intel gets back into the game and if Intel can slash their prices it might end-up being the right choice.  At the same price, Intel is dead on arrival. At a serious discount they will take the place of AMD. No one is buying Strix Halo for handhelds, it is too expensive.",Neutral
Intel,"Both are right/wrong.  Intel made their comparisons to Strix point because they’re in the same power class. Panther lake is much faster than Strix Point at the same power level (according to Intel, AMD doesn’t deny that) at 45W.  AMD says it doesn’t matter because their Strix halo (up to 120W) is faster which is pretty obvious.   It’s not technically lying, AMD is just referencing an entirely different class of product.",Neutral
Intel,Plenty of folks tested it at CES.  Intel was confident enough to let reporters run benchmarks and it's basically around 4050 level.  You should be able to run most games at 1080p at medium-high settings in an Ultrabook form factor.,Neutral
Intel,"Well lunar lake is a monster and competes directly with the z2e both on performance and efficiency, so no reason to think panther lake will be worse.  Even if it falls short of Intels claims it will still be the leader until next year.",Neutral
Intel,The noise is doing a great job advertising for them. A war between them with fighting words will get them tons of free advertising.,Positive
Intel,And a much higher power budget.  AMD says they win because their 120W chip is faster than Intels 45W chip.   No surprise to anyone.,Positive
Intel,"I generally agree but i suspect that the 388h is using a much larger gpu than people suspect. I think its probably ~165mm2 in size, not 55mm2. i suspect the 55mm2 die varient is for the 4xe version, and the 12xe version is 3x that size.  I also dont understand why strix halo is so expensive. It would be interesting to see bom and packaging costs.",Neutral
Intel,"It sounds like RDNA4 just doesn't scale at all. All the rumors point to them going straight from RDNA3.5 to RDNA5 in APUs, just skipping RDNA4 all together.",Negative
Intel,RDNA 3.5 was the only reason I didn’t invest in a STRIX HALO mini PC. The price is too much for outdated unsupported tech.,Negative
Intel,"Might be the same reason they stuck with Vega for so long in APUs.  At the current available desktop memory (DDR4 at the time) an architecture change wouldn't have made a huge difference.    Once DDR5 came out for laptops, we finally saw RDNA 2+ APUs (Ryzen 6000 APUs).  I'd bet once DDR6 starts appearing on laptops we'll get a similar iGPU architecture leap.",Neutral
Intel,"AMD probably just didn't bother making a new APU design when they didn't have new CPU core to go with it. Medusa Halo is rumored for 2027 with Zen 6 and UDNA/RDNA5, so the Point version will likely release then too.",Neutral
Intel,AMD has and always will be their own worst enemy,Negative
Intel,"It's not like they aren't developing something this whole time, releases are planned many years in advanced. Intel will have some rope and then will get inevitably leap frogged",Neutral
Intel,It's not like Intel isn't doing the same. Panther Lake and ARC are holdovers of things developed under Gelsinger.,Neutral
Intel,"> AMD is going to f--- around and let Intel catch up, in CPUs and GPUs.  this is what we actually need: competition. AMD kicked intels butt, now intel is kicking back. it's a win for us either way.",Neutral
Intel,I hope Intel will catch up and encourage AMD to compete. Having cleat leader in CPUs or GPUs is bad for consumers.,Negative
Intel,"I mean, we know that AMD is innovating. They literally showed Zen 6 at CES. Its just not ready yet for mobile, and Intel caught up. Same thing happened with Alder Lake, where intel released that before Zen 4 was ready.",Neutral
Intel,"So AMD having much faster iGPUs for decade or more did not do much.  But now Intel rolling out something at unknown price/power package will absolutely decimate AMD.  Regardless of what will happen, ""AMD's fault"" indeed. (amazing silicon designers and experts at everything posting for free on reddit have convinced me)",Negative
Intel,"Laptops haven't really been AMD's focus, and apart from Zen1, AMD's focus has been mostly on data center, with desktop being the natural offshoot.",Neutral
Intel,Yeah they ain't immune to being complacent.  And bad press doesn't make Intel stay bad.,Negative
Intel,"News at 10: ""Companies prioritise profits""",Neutral
Intel,"so either AMD doesn't have the capacity to produce them, or OEMs aren't interested, neither option is a compelling reason for AMD to focus on mobile",Negative
Intel,"We’d wish they were, but they’re not. Intel was struggling on all fronts due to their fabs. Amd is actually moving super fast in data centre so both epyc and instinct which is where they believe their money will be. They just don’t care to do anything in the consumer market.",Negative
Intel,"Halo is so much faster that the upscaler difference doesn't matter at all. Of course, it is probably also bigger.",Positive
Intel,"Yes, Strix Halo",Neutral
Intel,And having fsr4 supported in mobile at all,Neutral
Intel,FSR 4+ may be great but game support (number of titles + GPUs supported) is embarrassingly low,Negative
Intel,Dlss 4.5 not that great in my opinion. It fixes some ghosting but creates more shimmering because it has so much sharpening. I had to dial back to 4.0.,Negative
Intel,wildcat lake.  only issue it seems to be using 2 P cores and 4 LPE cores instead of E + LPE,Neutral
Intel,70% faster being “barely eke out a win”? Go ask why amd is stuck with 18 month old architecture despite intel managing to replace arrow lake after 12?,Negative
Intel,"You’ve got it backwards. The majority of laptops use IGPUs. IGPUs being as powerful as integrated graphics allows for cheaper thinner devices that are more power efficient. The entire intel CPU/IGPU performs on par with a 4050 at 60w at only 45w. When you factor in the 10-15w the CPU takes with the 4050 and you’re looking at similar performance at like half the power.   Being power efficient opens up a lot of form factors to be able to game with such as thin and light laptops, tablets, or gaming handhelds",Neutral
Intel,"> I used to be an AMD fan, but as soon as competition with Intel was gone, AMD raised their prices and now act as if they believe they are a luxury brand.   That's why it's silly to be a ""fan"" or ""supporter"" of one company or the other.  They don't care about you, they care about making money and when they have a dominant position they will exploit it.  > At the same price, Intel is dead on arrival. At a serious discount they will take the place of AMD. No one is buying Strix Halo for handhelds, it is too expensive.  Outside of that one device (Ayaneo maybe?), you're right.  But now AMD is also releasing an 8-core version of Strix Halo with the full 40 GPU CUs, which should be cheaper.  I expect that we'll see that in more handhelds at the high end.  Realistically speaking, it's easy to make the case that on a 7""-9"" screen the 40 CUs is way overkill.  There's still room for a middle ground that Intel could easily fill.",Negative
Intel,"Absolutely consumers win when competition is hot, AMD has a bit too much of a lead ATM so they are cashing in and getting lazy. That said I am glad they are having their day, only because a few years ago they were on the brink of bankruptcy and I really want to see them on a fairly level playing field with Intel... If we end up with 2 juggernauts training blows, having big resesrch budgets, etc we'll get lots of innovation and competitive pricing.",Neutral
Intel,"You had to shovel $1k for a 8 core CPU for about a decade, before AMD came.  So ""it just hiked the price"" is BS.  AMD cannot keep prices low while TSMC, effective monopolist, keeps posting record profits quarter after quarter.",Negative
Intel,AMD is basically just waiting for their chance to do the bad things. They are a corporation after all.,Negative
Intel,"Help us Cyrix, you are our only hope...",Positive
Intel,AMD has always been like this. The OG Athlon FX line from ~22 years ago were $1000 CPUs.,Neutral
Intel,Wasn't it equivalent more or less to the 4050m as it was power limited to 30 watts?,Neutral
Intel,"It's the price of the final product that will matter.  And given that Intel has lion's share of the mobile market, I don't see why the would not ask outrageous $$$ for it.  It is ""impressive"" only in the ""for iGPU"" context.   Based on the benches shown, laptops were consuming around 60W.  While AMD""s 370 HX has been shown to be able to game at below 20W, so uh.  Let's bait for wenchmarks in any case.",Neutral
Intel,"Sure, sure.  I'm going to wait for proper benchmarks done under lab conditions and documented by more than ""Intel let me run this game with the FPS counter on.""

I'm just not going to blindly accept ""first impressions"" as a replacement for proper testing.",Neutral
Intel,*With 64gigs of ram at 9600mhz,Neutral
Intel,"Tbf, it's like dgpu winner is claimed by who has the strongest one, so in that way it's kinda fair.  But how's the availability? Is halo in laptops actually? What's the pricing?  And what's the bang per buck on point and this?",Neutral
Intel,"https://x.com/jaykihn0/status/1812898063502938260/photo/1  ""PTL-H 12Xe pictured."" so according to that the 55mm2 die variant is xe12",Neutral
Intel,"12 Xe cores is 60% of the 20 cores in the B580 and that's 272mm², but of course that also has GDDR memory controllers, and such that aren't needed on a GPU chiplet, but it's likely that the die for the top SKU is quite a bit bigger than 55mm², I'd say between 90 and 130 mm².",Neutral
Intel,">I think its probably ~165mm2 in size, not 55mm2.   Which might open an ""dGPU sized iGPUs"" race.  NV could be the main victim here Surely AMD can oversize its iGPUs too.  I actually thought that AMD was forced to do so, by Filthy Green's GPP effectively banning AMD dGPUs. Typing this from G15 AMD Advantage Edition TUF.",Neutral
Intel,What matters is the intel chip regardless of actual die size runs on quad channel LPDDR memory instead of the octa channel of strix halo and is fitting into mid and small size laptops 15-45w.,Neutral

Intel,RDNA5 doesn't exist. The actual name for the next generation architecture is UDNA1.,Neutral

Intel,This. Plus even lunar lake outperformed Strix Point in many scenarios already. Intel is at least one generation ahead here,Positive
Intel,"It's not the 4050 at 60W. The laptop they compared only allows for 30W to the 4050. Nvidia's specs for the 4050 is 35W minimum, so I don't know how Dell even got to 30W. Below a certain wattage, gpu performance decreases exponentially because a minimum level of power is required to even have the gpu turned on.   Panther Lake is built on Intel 18A, which is supposed to be much better than the 'ancient' TSMC 5nm the 4050 is built on. The 4050's cpu is also Arrow Lake, which is less efficient than Lunar Lake. Again, that skews the agenda.   You can already game on thin and light devices with discrete graphics. Laptops like Asus's G14 is only 3.3lb, but sports a 4060 which is like twice as fast as intel's new igpu. The dgpu turns itself off when on battery, and the integrated graphics takes over. Anything more intensive should be used with a charger plugged in.   In short, paying for a big igpu doesn't make much sense for anyone interested in performance. And gaming handhelds? Does anyone really care about those useless bricks for investment into integrated graphics? It's not like the cost of Panther Lake is going to be cheap when its laptops start at $1300. With that kind of money, you can get 2025 Asus Zephyrus G14 with a 5060 and blow its shit out the water. Or for those on a budget, 5050 laptops have been seen for $600.   Integrated graphics have come so far, pairing Intel's newest 18A Panther Lake with an RTX 4050 could still make a lot of sense.",Negative
Intel,"Ehh not the mayority but *all* computers use iGPUs. The thing is, for the average Joe aka 95% of the market, there won't be a difference in the usage between an Intel Iris or RTX 5090 dGPU. And the efficiency would only come into place if they would game on battery (who does that anyways) or create/edit videos (again, virtually no one would do that without a dGPU). And even then, having your laptop drained in 2 hours 15 minutes instead of 2 hours is not ""gamechanging""   So it does not affect the efficiency at all during webbrowsing, watching videos, creating documents etc.  Thats also the reason why Intel has the non X 5,7,9 which will properly be by far the more demanded version as, again, the average Joe does not care the slightest about iGPU.  And apart from the iGPU, PTL is just a tiny step up from the Ultra 200 series...",Neutral

Intel,"How are you determining that AMD has a ""lead""?  In terms of Marketshare, Intel absolutely dominates x86, especially mobility (laptops), and if you walk into a Best Buy and ask 10 random customers ""Would you ever consider buying an AMD laptop?"", five of them would ask ""What's AMD?"", another three would say ""Isn't that a budget brand?"" (Their ""awareness"" of the zeitgeist of PC hardware is stuck in 2005), and maybe, and that's a big maybe, two out of ten would have a favorable opinion of AMD hardware so long as they've been paying attention for the last few years.  In terms of budget and expenditure, in 2025, Intel spent $17 billion in R&D versus AMD's $7.4 billion, outsizing it by a large amout. Total sales for 2025 are projected at approximately $53 billion for Intel and $33 billion for AMD.  I see this all the time and I've seen it for the past 8 years.... the only place that AMD has a ""lead"" is in the mind of PC hardware enthusiasts.... because it's not in the numbers as seen above (sales, expenditure, market share, etc), and it's not in the ""mindshare"" of your average consumer.  Hypothetically speaking, we could say that in a duopoly, as with Intel/AMD in x86, the BEST situation a consumer could hope for would be an even 50%/50% split in marketshare.... this would bring about the fiercest competition and would hopefully lower prices, increase innovation, etc. (and yet another reason why any fanboy who wants their favored company to dominate is LITERALLY cheering against their own interests as a consumer) Even with AMD's seriously impressive turnaround, their capture of marketshare, their ability to compete with two of the largest companies in the world while having considerably fewer resources, they still have a very, very, long way to go before approaching 50% of the x86 market across all segments.  In fact, to get any closer to that idealistic 50/50 split, AMD would have to continue winning and Intel losing for for many more years.  In other words, fears that AMD is ""becoming what Intel used to be"" and ""getting lazy"" are not an accurate reflection of the reality.",Neutral

So performance wise panther lake should be about on par with a full powered 3050Ti laptop.  That plus more advanced ray-tracing cores, it's running doom dark ages really well, AMD is still stuck at RDNA 3.5 and ray-traced games suck on the 890M.

Intel,"No, not really. Making up a ""winner"" is stupid and nothing but fanboy behavior.  A faster dGPU is generally better because you’re generally not power limited on a desktop. It doesn’t really matter whether or not you have a 5060 or 5090 or whatever.  In mobile systems it’s a huge difference.  There are entirely different power classes that don’t compete with each other. A thin and light notebook with a 15W CPU cannot have a 100W CPU in it.  Panther lake aims towards unplugged performance which is the 45W power class and the same as Strix Point.  Strix Halo is a much higher power class that requires a laptop to be plugged in permanently for the full performance.  It’s for mobile desktops that are usually plugged in but can be mobile for some time with heavily degraded performance.  It’s an entirely different class of product and you won’t find (many) devices where Strix Halo and Strix Point/Panther Lake compete with each other.",Neutral

Now they need \~10-20% less die area. meaning their performance per transistor basically doubled gen/gen. which is unheard of. Even maxwell (largest architectural uplift in the history of GPUs in the last 10 years) did not achieve anything close to that. And it was a massive overhaul with huge changes.

The Pantherlake datasheet isn't public yet, but you can see plainly in the [actual spec sheet](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/memory-controller-mc/) for Arrowlake H that it supports 8 channels of LPDDR5X (additional [spec](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/supported-memory-modules-and-devices/) for channel width).

You cannot gang these channels into a dual channel mode, that is not how modern memory works, and there is no allowance in the LPDDR5 spec for 64b channels. The 16b channels have separate command/address buses and burst for a sufficient length (32n) to fill a cache line with each access.  To be clear I think standardising on 64b ""channels"" for marketing specifications is a good thing, it allows quick mental calculation of memory bandwidth without having to get into the nitty gritty.

This isn't exactly surprising to me, as I researched my GPU options to death before buying one, and the general consensus is that Nvidia is stronger in the ray tracing department. But if I were to boot up, say, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, a game that supports ray tracing at 60 fps on the base Play Station 5, could I expect it to perform better than a similarly demanding game that wasn't particularly optimized for AMD hardware?  It's largely hypothetical question, as I already own the GPU, am satisfied with the GPU, and of course did my due diligence before buying the GPU so I would know exactly what to expect.

Now my RX 9070 XT is not detected at all in BIOS or Windows Device Manager, and I only get display output from the motherboard.  WHAT HAPPENED To see the old SATA SSD in the boot menu I had to enable CSM in the BIOS. Booting into that drive resulted in a black screen. I then used a Live USB to run the boot-repair utility with the recommended repair settings. This seems to have installed the GRUB partition onto my Crucial T500 M.2 drive instead of the SATA drive. Now I can boot into both OSs, but the GPU is completely invisible to the system.  CURRENT STATUS Windows Device Manager only shows the Integrated Graphics. When I try to install AMD drivers, the installer fails because it cannot detect the GPU. I was briefly able to get graphics output from my GPU by unplugging the PC, flipping the PSU switch to off, and holding the power button to empty the capacitors. I then booted it up with the HDMI cable plugged into my GPU and I saw the asrock logo but it was stuck there for 2 minutes and I impatiently turned it off. I'm also considering trying this again and letting it run it's course  PLAN AND QUESTIONS I am planning to disconnect the SATA SSD and try to wipe the Ubuntu boot entries from the M.2 drive to see if the GPU reappears. Has anyone experienced a Linux bootloader repair or CSM toggle hiding a GPU from the BIOS? Specifically, could the Crucial T500 and ADATA drive conflict be causing PCIe initialization issues after the CSM change? Should I try clearing the CMOS first? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

So I said screw it, I'm gonna rebuild my PC and switch to AMD.   So I bought a MSI x870e Tomahawk Wifi Mobo, and Ryzen 9950x3d. I assembled everything, and it posts first try. Great. So I install Windows 11 and get to configuring things, removing bloat, etc, and I start having freezes. And my screens blinking off and a message telling me there was a failure and that it needs to put the graphics into safe mode.   On top of that, I was having a lot of random hiccups and lag. I checked with LatencyMon and was having all sorts of DPC latency with my Nvidia drivers. So I uninstall the drivers with DDU and install an older driver (566.36) and cool, things seem more stable. Except they're not. Now I'm getting high latency from other drivers like storage and network. So I'm thinking okay maybe it's the ram. So I run memtest86 overnight only to find my PC shut off at some point. I figured the ram must be faulty. So I took out one stick and tested it with the other and the test completed. I'm thinking okay, ram stability could explain a lot of things, so I've found the issue. So I stay with one stick and up the DRAM voltage to 1.35 to see how it goes.   I'm still getting intermittent latency. Some programs crashing, and on top of that, my PC won't shut down now.

Intel,"I feel like the HUB guys are going too hard with their VRAM crusade. Why recommend a GPU that's slower now just because it might be faster in the future?   A slight downgrade in render resolution or texture quality is hardly even noticeable, and with looming shortages I feel like most studios are going to start optimizing for lower VRAM further reducing the long term disadvantage of 8GB GPUs.",Negative
Intel,"The real answer, buy a used 2080ti. Usable VRAM, DLSS4, it still is 250W so it can run on most PSUs.  It is the most balanced option if you can't afford a 9060XT 16GB.",Positive
Intel,"all of them are power hungry junk, where are good cards?",Negative
Intel,real hero here,Positive
Intel,"Intel is on the right path, but they need to start using 384-bit memory interfaces on 12GB cards instead of the 192-bit memory interface they used on this card.",Neutral
Intel,Does the 9060xt with fsr have higher performance than 5060 oc edition No Ti with dlss? And by how much?,Neutral
Intel,"The 5060 will crush, without less than a 40 percent difference, from dlls alone. Then add frame gen. WOW I can't believe you can get away with this.",Positive
Intel,5060 then cuz way better in AI  5% performance cut to gain 2x-3x AI speed,Positive
Intel,What processor are you using with 9060 xt?  Is it the same as you were using with 6600 xt?,Neutral
Intel,"Can you tell me how well it runs games at 1440p? Have you played some of the demanding ones like Black Myth Wukong, Stalker 2, etc? Do you play at medium? high? I assume FSR is always on.   And also what's your target FPS? Would really appreciate the feedback, because I have the same card and I'm thinking on switching to 1440p but I don't know what monitor would be good refreshrate-wise",Neutral
Intel,"Honestly? Pretty decent deal for a 8GB model, considering how the 16GB cost around 450$ these days, almost double the price.",Positive
Intel,"Well yeah, the cheapest RX 9060 XT 16GB is [$380](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/video-card/#c=596&sort=price&page=1&P=11811160064,51539607552) and the cheapest RTX 5060 TI 16GB is [$430](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/video-card/#sort=price&P=11811160064,51539607552&c=593). When you're comparing $300 GPUs, you're not going to bring up a GPU that's nearly another hundred dollar.",Neutral
Intel,"That would be a completely new phenomenon if you look at the past. Sure, some (probably indie) studio will optimize their games, but they would have done so already because they care about their customers.  Nothing will change with the current devs or tech, it's just a temporary issue that memory is that expensive. The prices will be lower in 2027, or we'll get used to it and buy more expensive stuff.",Neutral
Intel,"6 ish year old product that is out of warranty from some rando, is not exactly comparable here and definitely not a ""real answer""",Negative
Intel,"Dunno why you're being downvoted, the 2080 Ti is still very good value for the price and often has good OC headroom. Beats 5060 in most cases and you're right about 11GB being decent",Positive
Intel,The real answer is to stop being cheap and spend money on your hobbies.,Neutral
Intel,you tell us,Neutral
Intel,Why do power requirements matter?   Electricity costs pennies,Negative
Intel,So many think memory bandwidth matters more than it does. The 5060 ti has less bandwidth than the B580. Architecture matters a lot.  More bandwidth would do next to nothing for it.,Negative
Intel,AMD cards have upscaling and framegen as well...,Neutral
Intel,"Can you elaborate what do you mean by ""AI speed""?",Neutral
Intel,No. Dlss and frame gen is much less impactful in terms of performance boost at the low end and the latency is more noticeable. It’s also half the vram.,Negative
Intel,WOW 25 so far for the TRUTH. HUB and fooling now.,Positive
Intel,"Yes, same processor, 5600x",Neutral
Intel,"I only play Space Engineers, Cyberpunk 2077, Helldivers 2 and pre-2020 videogames, new games are meh for me.  All of them at high with ultra textures and a few middle settings at things i never notice mid-game at 1440p 27"" IPS monitor, 60fps (don't care for more, maybe one day i'll try 75fps).   Runs very cool and quiet, never hitting above 65°C on closed room 20°C ambient temperature, my case sounds the same as a 20"" metal fan at speed 1, which is the same white noise that helps me sleep at night, an upgrade compared to my old RX 6600 during the summer lol.  Not sure if this helped or way too late, just wanted to comment anyways.",Neutral
Intel,"yeah seriously, here b580 is noticably cheaper for example.",Negative
Intel,"Yeah, I just wanted to point it out because there’s people like me to whom prices in dollars means nothing (or who don’t read the title) and then waste time watching an irrelevant video (though I skipped to the conclusion so not that much time).🙂",Negative
Intel,"Point being? If a cap blows because it's old any repair shop can fix it, If it's a fan dying you can fix that yourself.  On the other side there's not much the warranty can do for running out of VRAM.",Negative
Intel,"In this economy? It doesn't make any sense to not keep perfectly usable hardware that does the job just fine out of a landfill.   A 2080ti or a 3070 or AMD equal is more than enough performance for most people. Easily, and is way better bang for your buck.",Neutral
Intel,"In a time of global economic uncertainty, it's a horrendous time to overspend on hobbies.",Negative
Intel,"heat, noise, size, messy cables",Negative
Intel,"Correct, but they do not have commercial dlss support. How many games do you not have the ability and ww do?   Thanks for the dowmvotes nvidia. Amd brainwashed.   Just to let you know: you have all been played. Look closer.",Negative
Intel,"They're seemingly referring to the speed of running LLMs locally using that GPU, unless I'm also out of the loop. A good sub to look into that stuff would be /r/LocalLLM   I wouldn't recommend doing that with a 5060 but the 16gb version must be the best choice in that price range and would handle the very small models easily and the small ones with a little slowness.",Neutral
Intel,"News flash: We're always in ""this economy"". I know someone who works at a fucking McDonalds, has a kid, and spends more money on his hobbies than you do.",Negative
Intel,nothing global about it,Neutral
Intel,"So you prefer low power for lower heat and smaller size.   I'm not space conscious, so those things don't matter.   What's with messy cables? The PC sits under the table, so it also doesn't matter how ugly it is.",Negative
Intel,"Well actually people have been modding games to put FSR where neither AMD or NVIDIA added official support.   Pretty much every game had amd nvidia and even intel upscaling these days.   In fact, when i still had my 3080ti, i was able to use AMD’s framegen in many games (cyberpunk, dying light, talos principle) because NVIDIA didnt provide any option for 3000 series.   I still bought nvidia because amd doesnt offer any cards at 5080 level, so no brainwashing here. You’re completely uneducated blinded by consumerism",Neutral

Intel,They sound irresponsible.,Negative
Intel,"If you spend more on your hobbies than the things you actually need, you might be financially irresponsible",Negative
Intel,"the unhinged extra power cables attached to the card itself, it makes everything harder to handle  and heat isn't just about the size of the case, it's noise and comfort of the room  and no, AC doesn't solve that as it's another source of noise that is even worse than the PC itself, only to be used when the weather is too bad to live otherwise",Negative
Intel,"Oh yeah? And who do you think had went through hundreds of accounts taking about that mod?   Came out DEC 22 2023 I remember the day I went from 22fps in Alan wake 2 to 50 (3070). I posted in this site non stop ban after ban just to try and get you this information. Go on the forums you will pick me out if you look back.   I, in all seriousness, would not be surprised if you know about that mod from ME.   Therefore, I am not blinded. I simply understand that an entire company propped up by manipulation on social media (and GPU) should not exist, and a real competitor would be in their place. There I have just demonstrated that not only am I not blinded, it might be you. Good on you for knowing about that mod (serious).   I will tell you another secret, maybe not meant for you. If you don't mind using dlss and mfg? 5060ti 16gb all day for 1440p or lower. Not only is it hundreds of fps, it has valuable vram on it that will see the card rise in price since it's discontinued.   Hows that for an uneducated prediction?",Neutral
Intel,Gotcha.  What's your preferred card?,Neutral
Intel,from this generation that'd be RTX Pro 4000 Blackwell generation SFF with replaced cooler  personally I own a passive A2000 SFF that replaced my modded 1650 (KalmX was released too late),Neutral

Intel,I just tested the release on four machines (76X&78XT/78X3D&79XTX/97X&9070XT/75F&76XT). Every system still suffers from crashing drivers when hardware-accelerated apps are used (Chrome/Discord/etc.).  Please fix. :),Negative

Intel,Did this driver fix purple visual glitches with the RX 7700 XT? It's a known bug that appeared after the driver 25.4.1,Neutral
Intel,"The ignorance by amd of Rx 7000 users is astounding tbh, but this is 2025 AMD not prior AMD where they would try to appease a larger user base.  It's going to make me rethink my loyalty for future gfx purchases",Negative
Intel,So we cant test path tracing performance yet on Cyberpunk? Lol,Neutral
Intel,"This is a very underwhelming update for RDNA 4 users I get that this technology needs to mature, but they should already be at a point where the implementation is across more wide array of games.

Intel,"Thanks for nothing again, AMD.  Signed, 7900 XTX user.",Negative
Intel,So is there any point to installing this if I'm on RDNA2 and don't have any of the issues that they fixed?,Negative
Intel,This is the worst driver amd made 9060xt for me. 2 games instantly crashes. Indiana jones and silent hill 2. With this driver if you enable ray tracing game hangs and give error.i already report bugs in 25.12.1 and same with 25.11.1 and amd does nothing. every ray tracing titles works ok with 25.10.1 driver and this is bad. amd does not listen users anymore. anyone has any crashes happen like me?thanks...,Negative

Intel,Still no fsr 4 support for rdna3 🙄,Negative

Intel,"u/AMD_Vik Hey there! Just want to let you know that I've seen a lot of people have problems lately (including myself) with Direct-to-Display/Directmode implementations for DisplayPort/HDMI wired VR Headsets. DirectMode cannot enable reliably even on SteamVR native HMDs, and the only way to get them running right now is by installing a older driver version, enabling directmode there, and then updating to a newer version with the directmode already set -> so directmode itself still works fine, but there seem to be problems toggling into this. I also saw this happening with other VR compositors like PimaxPlay though radeon users are generally not as common there.  Happens with every driver released after and including 25.4.1 on my machine, and driver older than 25.3.1 can toggle into Directmode just fine. It is still broken as of 25.12.1 and 26.1.1  at first I thought this was a somewhat individual issue but as I've looked into it I saw more and more people have that problem with RDNA3 and RDNA4 GPUs across the board for basically any VR headset that uses Directmode.  I remember you mentioning on the AMD forums once that you want to be hit up about VR related issues - but really I didn't know how else I would reach out to you.",Negative
Intel,I hope this fixes the many crashes I've had since the last update...,Negative
Intel,"Still enjoying the piss out of the 7900XTX on 25.9.2. It chews through everything I throw at it at the settings I choose, don't care about new driver releases unless a new game I want to play doesn't play well on whatever driver I currently have installed.",Negative
Intel,"Even tho I have a 9070xt this is still so underwhelming… We waited 6 months and got basically nothing yet. Sorry for all rdna2, 3 users.  Fun fact: Its been years now that the adrenaline software cant be opened, the only fix ist to press win+p and select only main monitor. Than start it, than swap monitor profile again…   Definetly buying nvidia next time, not supporting this big company anymore, which is behind in every aspect.

Intel,u/AMD_Vik      In 2022 AMD made changes to OpenGL Driver. So since 2022 the extension gl\_ati\_fragment\_shader is missing in the driver.

Initially it didn't, before eventually swapping to the smart technology screen. I then went back to the record tab and tried again: same results.  That's about all I've got for specific steps. I closed Adrenalin and went back to doing whatever and I noticed my fans turned on and like two minutes later when I went to close my browser my cursor stopped before I got to the corner of my screen and I needed to hard power down my system.

Intel,"Which driver are you currently on? I'm just curious; personally, I'm on 25.9.2, and surprisingly, I have 0 problems, unlike with previous versions. Should I try 25.12.1?",Positive
Intel,"Nope. Generally if the driver does not massively increases performance in some game, or you don't have any issues or the issue you have isn't fixed, then it's not worth updating, unless there is some new feature you want.    I reverted back to 25.9.1 (from the top of my head) because with any newer driver BF6 crashes randomly, and neither DICE nor AMD seem to give a damn about it.

Intel,"I think Linux developers are doing some experiments As of now, FSR 4 (FidelityFX Super Resolution 4) does not officially support RDNA 2 or RDNA 3 GPUs, even on Linux.

RDNA 3: Partial Support via Develer’s VKD3D-Proton  - Develer’s VKD3D-Proton 3.0 includes support for FP8 (8-bit floating point), which is required for FSR 4. - This means RDNA 3 GPUs (like RX 7600, 7900 XT/XTX) can run FSR 4 in some games via Proton, even though AMD doesn’t officially enable it. - Global override toggles in AMD’s 25.9.1 driver can bypass the FSR 4 whitelist, allowing it to run in FSR 3.1-compatible games.  I hope they succed it will be a slap in the face.",Neutral

Intel,"Your best case is your RX 7900 turning into Balsamico, whatever that means.",Positive

Now before I get kicked to death by angry people, there is a version of FSR Redstone that uses and INT8 path that is compatible and will work on 2 and 3, however that has not been launched today and AMD have not confirmed it will be.   That isn't to say they won't do it, but right now it's not been announced.

The ups and downs are from me alt tabbing in the graphs, by  the way.   This is with core clock -200mhz applied in Afterburner and no crashes, boosts to just above declared boost clocks. Here the dips in up and down on power are probably me toying around how much exactly -mhz is needed.  [afterburner -200mhz](https://i.ibb.co/YTQfGJtc/11111.png)  All of the crashing behavior so far is replicable in COD, CS2, Cronos New Dawn.  u/AMD_Vik",Negative
Intel,thanks for reaching out - funny timing; I noted that on the internal ticket for this issue yesterday having seen other accounts of end users noting this issue persists even with 25.12.1. Perhaps the fix aligned to that point release somehow slipped.,Neutral
Intel,It’s for Darktide apparently,Neutral
Intel,any game with fsr 3.1 fg also has the new fg since drivers override it. it’s also why they stopped versioning fsr. any game with fsr 3.1 should just automatically have any new version of fsr when the drivers update,Neutral

Intel,"On my end, the driver crashes. Most of the time it manages to recover (sometimes it will crash a few more times before stabilising).

Intel,Oh thank god it's not just me.,Negative
Intel,"My experience with switching to amd was so smooth and perfect until 25.9.1.

Intel,I would continue buying their GPUs if they gave me something to buy.  The XTX has no upgrade path on RDNA4.,Neutral
Intel,"I had Nvidia for years, the main reason I switched was that the drivers went to shit last year. I'm just sick of them in general, too. The 7800 XT I bought has been one of the most trouble free cards I ever had, aside from Adrenalin randomly closing in certain versions.",Negative
Intel,"If I could get my hands on a 5070 Ti I’d happily switch. AMD likes to take advantage of the underdog, for-the-people image whenever it’s convenient but they’ll just as quickly throw us under the bus and fuck us raw once they’ve got the bag.

Intel,"Most of the conversations happened across various discord servers, so I cannot directly link them, but I also found a few posts here on reddit that seem to point towards the same direction which roughly match with the timeframe.   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/1nl0540/direct\_mode\_not\_working/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/1nl0540/direct_mode_not_working/)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1ljezuf/steamvr\_crashing\_on\_amd\_drivers\_after\_2451\_direct/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1ljezuf/steamvr_crashing_on_amd_drivers_after_2451_direct/)  It's a bit odd because if you set the flag beforehand with a older version and then update to newer versions, Directmode still works fine, but if you fully remove the drivers with AMD's driver removal utility or Display Driver uninstaller (which propably deletes some cached driver file for directmode, is my guess), Directmode disables fully and can't turn on anymore at all.      As far as headsets are concerned, I know at least Valve's implementation seems to suffer from this (I know about cases involving the Valve Index, Bigscreen Beyond and Vive Pro 1, all using Valve's implementation), but somebody in the pimax subreddit community discord seemed to have the same problem, which he also was only able to fix by rolling back the drivers.  I could propably reach out to a few more affected people over discord and encourage them to get active here, if you'd like.

Intel,"Hi - I am having this problem. I wanted to try the special ROCM driver so dutifully did a clean install as suggested.  Tried to launch SteamVR and it errored. Realised headset had reverted to being a monitor, running at low resolution (less than recommended) Increased the resolution to recommended (combined resolution of the two panels), and SteamVR started detecting the headset - though promoted to enable direct mode. Pressing the button to enable it restarts SteamVR, but then prompts again, and HMD is still a monitor.   Interestingly reverting to the RDNA 4 release driver, it instantly worked - Direct Mode was enabled without me having to toggle.  So it is like SteamVR is successfully toggling something, but the newer AMD drivers ignore whatever it is doing/don't act on it. As soon as older driver is installed, it does act on it, and the HMD disappears from Display Settings/stops being treated as a monitor.  This wouldn't affect the majority of SteamVR users who are streaming to a Quest, and it wouldn't impact people who upgrade to a newer driver without a cleanup.  It would affect people doing fresh installs with a recent driver, and people who do clean driver installs/use DDU.",Neutral

Main impact is on pcie bandwidth as it'll use up quite a lot there, and to a smaller degree RAM load, so you definitely don't want to run some other dynamic load on the igpu when gaming to overwhelm its pcie link.

For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch. Of course, we have very little outside insight into the exact spread of these cases that AMD wants to pay their engineers to work on.",Neutral

It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.

Intel,"It has nothing to do with the lack of vulkan support, even when fsr4 comes to vulkan, the game still needs ray regeneration implementation from the devs, you cant use optiscaler through dlss inputs, like you probably will be able to in fx alan wake 2",Negative
Intel,I suppose is going to be fixed as soon as Amd Redstone go out. Basically is going to add every tecnology that Path tracing needs to work. Off course the devs would have to implement them in the game too,Neutral
Intel,"The issue is if you try to use path tracing. Which to be fair, you probably shouldn't unless the miracle of them getting Virtuous to implement Ray Regeneration in Cyberpunk happens.",Negative

Intel,Hmm fair. For me on 9070XT if I had raytracing enabled it would crash most regularly on loading back to the menu after extraction which was annoying but at least not game destroying lol. But yeah annoying enough that I turned RT off entirely.   I hope this means I can turn it back on because the game runs well enough for it.,Negative
Intel,"Yes. So far, so good. I'm not 100% sure what fixed it.      I uninstalled both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master standalone applications. Deleted the ""amdryzenmasterv"" keys. Rebooted.  Then I installed Adrenalin and used the Ryzen Master installer in Adrenalin (Performance > Metrics > Install Ryzen Master).  I think this problem might have something to do with a handshake breaking between Ryzen Master and Adrenalin, after upgrading just Adrenalin.   From now on, I'll probably do clean installs, removing and reinstalling both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master, through Adrenalin Performance tab.",Positive
Intel,"My last two processors are ryzen amd, my last three video cards are amd radeon and next one will be amd also, nvidia has driver issues as well, to be honest.

I should have sold the 7700 xt and bought 9060 xt 16gb instead but too late for that now and it has problems as well, so lottery as i said, its a risk.",Negative

Intel,Which driver version and does it still crashing?,Neutral
Intel,OK I will install it now and test it and get back to you. Give me 10 mins.,Neutral
Intel,Yuppp. It does not work on bf6 but it works on ark survival ascended for me. Seems it might be a bf issue. I saw ppl saying they were getting more fps with this driver in BF6 but I think they didn't realize it's using FSR 3.1 and not 4.,Negative
Intel,I'll work with the engineer from that ticket check if that issue has somehow regressed.,Neutral
Intel,We've not been able to reproduce this internally so far. Can you remind me which GPU (was this a 7900XTX?) + connectivity method you're using?,Neutral
Intel,Try using DDU to uninstall your current drivers and do a clean install of the 25.10.2 combined drivers if you havent already (you can find it here):  https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-25-10-2.html,Neutral
Intel,"Yup just need to say ""No""",Neutral
Intel,"whew thanks, good think i noticed it first before updating. i have 25.10.2 and 25.9.2 here and they both have windows 10 along their filename so i might as well asked.",Positive
Intel,I don't see how it would work on 23.9.1 lol,Negative
Intel,"Did you use DDU to uninstall the drivers and then reinstall using a driver installer from the AMD website? I found this guide yesterday and it was extremely helpful, specifically step 8:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1lnxb8o/ultimate_amd_performance_fix_guide_stop_lag_fps/",Positive
Intel,I did it this morning before the new driver and confirm chipset drivers were untouched,Neutral
Intel,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.  More people use HDMI than what people think and those TVs don’t always have a DP connector at all.,Negative
Intel,"ah, that explains it. Thanks. :)",Positive
Intel,"What if one does not check release notes? V25.10.2 point to different packages, for installing both CPU and GPU you had to download the AutoDetect package (named “minimal install”). Obviously I’m referring to AMD driver download page.",Neutral
Intel,"Okay, as long as they have a workaround for that... I was planning to get a 9060XT, but also keep my 6700XT for lossless scaling frame gen, was worried the branching would affect that..",Neutral
Intel,"What a mess. I have rdna2 and 3 on the same PC, so combined driver is the solution for this? Or auto detect is the only way?",Negative
Intel,"Damn, that's a huge relief to hear. Most of the frustration came from not knowing whether the issue was even acknowledged.   Thanks a lot for the update.",Positive
Intel,What about Noise Suppression not working since 25.9.2?,Negative
Intel,Finally. The last driver without pink artifacting was 25.4.1  It has been 7 months. AMD Matt acknowledged the bug on [the amd forums](https://pcforum.amd.com/s/question/0D5KZ000011WpJJ0A0/pink-square-artifacting-chrome-discord-and-steam) 5 months ago.  Please let it be fixed with the next driver update. So many 7000series users are on the verge of swapping to Nvidia.  https://i.redd.it/ywrg9at3lp1g1.gif,Neutral
Intel,"what about whatever changed post 25.3.1 for multi monitors? Any driver 25.3.1 and older i can run my main at 200hz, my side at 165, and my third at 60 without issue. Any driver newer than 25.3.1 and running my main at 200hz then playing a game will cause the second monitor (165hz) to flicker, glitch, and freak out the entire time, until the game on the main monitor is closed. Dropping to 165 on the main monitor down from 200hz \*fixes\* the issue but, i paid for 200hz and would like to be able to actually use it again.  (7700xt system)",Neutral
Intel,Hell yeah 🙂 amd I appreciate you see the issues Iv been a fan boy for a long time and I know it will be fixed,Positive
Intel,"Hi. Sorry, I thought this was pretty common as I've had this issue with two different systems and 3 AMD GPUs across 2 generations. [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1jayump/chrome_full_screen_freezes_after_switching_to_amd/) [Or here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/3890720/parts-of-screen-freezes-when-using-chrome) Chrome (or other Chromium browsers, I've had this happen with Edge too) in fullscreen, with graphics acceleration enabled.   Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind this only actually matters if one protocol or the other is **actually** limiting bandwidth for the [resolution * FPS] you want to display on your monitor  For instance, DP 1.4 can do ~25Gbits/s, which translates to roughly 1440p @ 240fps, or 4k @ 120fps  If you have proper cable into HDMI 2.1, it should be able to do ~42Gbits/s, which would instead be 4k @ 190fps  Read up the wikipedia tables for bandwidth specs and resolution / fps / bit depth rates for more",Neutral

Intel,Cool. Thank you,Positive
Intel,I might turn on ray tracing in like a medium or low setting just for shits and giggles or screenshots but I don't plan on playing with it on all the time since I'll also play at 1440p so I don't wanna have a really bad experience 😖,Negative
Intel,Exactly! It's insane. I can't believe running through a translation layer is more stable than running native,Positive
Intel,"but i dont know something is also wrong with 25.11.1 ... AMD Adrenalin randomly vanishes from tray     i dont want to roll back to 25.9.1 :-(    but this version was the last which was good so far      maybe when we have luck amd is able to provide next time a ""perfect"" driver without any issues?",Negative
Intel,"Could be it, nothing hardware wise at all and just software too.     Yeah, you're not the 1st I've read that says they have issues on the game.     If you're crashing and the system reboots it does make me think of some stability issues and not really just GPU, but I'm guessing you've already tried stability tests and using the system without OC+A-XMP/EXPO disabled.     Once upon a time I remember reading some people, on other instances and other games, having crashes like that (complete reboot) due to PSU instability as well.     Good luck!",Neutral
Intel,That's strange. My game defaulted to everything maxed out including running ray tracing and I haven't noticed any issues. The game runs incredibly well.  I've got a 5800X3D & 9070XT as well.,Positive
Intel,"Fair enough, and yeah sooner the better for all of us",Positive
Intel,It absolutely could be.  Europe has some pretty good consumer law and promising features that could impact your purchase decision are part of this law.  It can fall under misleading advertisement,Neutral
Intel,"It's not freezing, it's just that the GPU usage is practically at 100% all the time, even with V-Sync enabled. With the 25.9 drivers, this doesn't happen, and the clock speed varies normally, increasing and decreasing as needed when V-Sync is enabled. These 25.10 drivers are causing the GPU to consume more energy unnecessarily.",Neutral
Intel,Fingers crossed,Positive
Intel,"Thanks for attempting to retest.  It's a 7900XTX with an Index connected via DisplayPort. I am on the latest 25.11.1 driver.  I run a monitor at 4k 120Hz 10bpc with HDR Off, which uses DSC, as my main and only display. I tried disabling DSC in the monitor settings which runs at 4k 120Hz 8bpc with HDR Off but I don't think I noticed a change in latency. I thought that DSC on and off on two different devices might contribute to the problem but I'm not sure.   I have also tried running the Index under a RX480 on another PC and I fairly certain the latency looks different under 90Hz and looks similar under 120Hz. Can't play much to test though as an RX480 runs the Index at a very blurry setting. Getting around to doing this test is what took me so long to reply.",Neutral
Intel,Were you able to find the issue?,Neutral
Intel,"Allright ty, will Install new, any differences in performance?",Neutral
Intel,"im running 25.11.1 on win10 7900xt. no problems besides afmf2 breaking the performance overlay, which ive had for multiple updates now",Neutral

Intel,Thank you for this. This was very helpful. Got adrenaline working fine now.,Positive
Intel,"I wish my LG C4 42"" had a display port. Its my primary monitor.",Positive
Intel,"Yep, AMD is not so quick in fixing their driver download page, I still can remember when X870E chipset came out but you found only X670 option.

Intel,since last BF6 Update i had zero crashes also on 25.11.1,Positive
Intel,"That's not how it works. Small print won't save you from stuff like this, you think that they can stop releasing this software for 2-3 years because some small print said 'Subject to change'?   European consumer law would absolutely support the consumer in this case. If you promise a feature by a certain date, you will need to deliver it.

Intel,"Works in Windows too. But Windows has way too much overhead for all of the AI garbage, ads and integrated spyware running in the background to still be a usable operating system. Linux is much better.   The drivers install all side-by-side, and all GPUs show up as OpenCL devices. In the software you can then select which one to run on.

My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative
Intel,One thing I appreciate about AMD is having the lowest CPU overhead for their graphics drivers. Makes a difference if you're CPU limited in a game.,Positive
Intel,So Nvidia now has the lowest driver overhead? Seems like they took the HUB video seriously,Neutral
Intel,So the money you save on a GPU you will need to spend on a better CPU??  Might as well get a faster GPU.,Negative
Intel,Interesting that B580 doesn't look bad at all with a 13600k. I wonder what it's like with a 13400 or 12600k. It seems like just having those extra threads provided by the e-cores takes care of the overhead it needs.,Positive
Intel,"Unless you're running a CPU that's *many* many years old, GPU overhead is not really something you need to worry about. Whether AMD has less overhead or Nvidia has less, it really doesn't matter.",Neutral
Intel,"On an older post an Intel graphics engineer explained the issue, it isn't what you said. Intel is too verbose in commands which slows everything down.",Negative
Intel,I'm fairly sure they use dxvk for d3d9 to 11.,Neutral

Intel,Battlemage drivers use the cpu for software accelerating certain processes that are not being hardware accelerated in the GPU.,Neutral
Intel,Glad you brought up Nvidia as I didn’t know this had improved until the testing around Arc showed it had gone.,Positive
Intel,"According to the graphs, AMD has slightly less overhead than NVIDIA.",Neutral
Intel,"No, they do not.  The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software.  They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  The main example that seems to suggest otherwise is actually a demonstration of nVidia's forced threading of DX11 games, which can increase performance despite the increased overhead it entails, when the CPU has enough headroom overall (i.e. it doesn't eat into the single-thread performance).",Negative
Intel,"Lowest with DX11 and older, but not with the newer APIs",Neutral
Intel,And when is the last time HUB did a dedicated video showing the improvement in overhead?,Neutral
Intel,or it's just a cache/memory access issue,Neutral
Intel,"The overhead is minimal for both AMD GPUs and NVIDIA GPUs, which is probably why reviewers didn't look at the overhead until Intel GPUs came along.",Neutral
Intel,"> Unless you're running a CPU that's many many years old, GPU overhead is not really something you need to worry about.   That's just not true with Battlemage.  CPUs released in 2024 showed the issue in testing.    It's not year of release, it's capabilities.",Negative
Intel,"Intel uses software translation for DX11 and lower, so it does matter for them.",Neutral
Intel,"Hmm, Nvidia lost less performance going from 14900k to 13600k than AMD but more when going down to 12100",Neutral
Intel,"> No, they do not. The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software. They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  This was true for Alchemist but not for Battlemage.",Negative
Intel,That's not true. Intel's issue is being too verbose in commands/calls.,Negative
Intel,"Never, because HUB doesn't like portraying Nvidia in any light besides negative.",Negative

Intel,That's actually... just worse news.,Negative
Intel,I always dreamt of the day APUs become power houses.,Neutral
Intel,"Is it my expectations being too high or this ain't a huge uplift? To go back to the classic: hopefully Zen 6 with RDNA 4 will offer a bigger uplift. We only have to wait a year and a half...  Anyway, question for the more knowledgeable people: how could the 890M perform with a 50W chip variant, but with 5600 SO-DIMM RAM? What to expect?",Neutral
Intel,"I find it sad that most review outlet is not testing CCX latency for these new CPUs.  These Zen 5 + Zen 5c have insanely high cross CCX latency, 180ms tested by geekerwan to be exact. For reference the 5950x had a 70ms latency for their cross ccd latency and the 4 ccd 1950x had a 150ms cross ccd latency with the closet 2 ccd and 200ms between the furthest 2.  Essentially games will be limited to the 5.1ghz peak 4 core zen5 core cluster or the 3.3ghz peak 8 core zen5c core cluster.",Negative
Intel,Damn Why is AMD even involved in iGPU,Negative
Intel,"If this is true, Strix Point is going to claim total dominance over the GTX 1650 market. Won't be until 2023 when the theoretical RTX 4050 is released to surpass Strix Point's efficiency. Then super budget-friendly Strix Halo will come next year and take the RTX 2080's lunch money. Game over Nvidia.",Positive
Intel,"Strix Halo is rumored to be a whopping 40 CUs of RDNA3.5 so...   That'll do it no sweat, if they release it.",Positive
Intel,almost there,Positive
Intel,"We're a ways off from that still. These Strix Point 890M results are comparable to 1/2 the performance of the RX 6600. That's only good enough for \~30 FPS in Assassins Creed Mirage at 1080p Max.  I think this will be great for non-gaming purposes, like Adobe, Autodesk and so on. 890M should be a photo editing powerhouse.",Positive
Intel,"I mean current consoles are already APU power houses, they can give you 120fps depending on the game, and 30-60fps depending on what mode you select. And these consoles are pretty power constrained and pared down compared to PCs. So this APU here could easily double the performance of a console.   That's tapping on 4070/7800 levels of performance.",Positive
Intel,Never gonna happen as long as they use DDR memory.  The only powerful APUs are those that use GDDR or HBM. See: every AMD-powered console and the MI300A.,Negative
Intel,"Radeon iGPUs are mostly limited by the shared RAM bandwidth. I was thinking of getting an 8700G a little while ago, and the benchmarks varied wildly depending on RAM frequency and overclocks.  Maybe they'll improve it by hooking it up to a wider GDDR bus in laptops, similar to how the current PS5 and Xboxes work (IIRC?)",Neutral
Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks. Intel is already moving on it and I think the main thing holding AMD back is that they rely on 3rd parties for memory packaging so the capacity goes to the more lucrative enterprise chips first.",Neutral
Intel,"The iGPU uplift is extremely underwhelming, I guess this is why Asus did the ROG Ally X model instead of waiting for these chips. I wouldnt be surprised if Lunar Lake with Xe2 passes Zen 5's iGPU at lower power levels, at higher ones im sure RNDA 3.5 will be ahead.",Negative

Intel,7500mhz ram and the 780m,Neutral
Intel,"if you don't consider power, sure, but in that case you may as well go discrete. efficiency is a big reason for these AIO packages and on-package memory can prevent breaking the power budget while pushing higher bandwidth.",Neutral
Intel,"Indeed. Also the closer the memory is to the CPU, the higher the speeds, thus bandwidth. On-package memory will always be faster.",Positive
Intel,"Have _you_ looked at the actual game benchmarks in the review? The Ally X (a low power handheld) is within 1fps of the bottom of the 890m laptops. It's 5-9fps to the very fastest (again a higher power laptop!!), all at 1080p high settings which i think should  be the target for this range of entries in the roundup.  There is nothing like a 40-60% uplift in those games and that very standard resolution? I was stoked for Strix Point myself but this is super underwhelming.",Neutral

Intel,"Based on the results, it seems like the next steam deck might be more than a year away. Not particularly impressive gains from the previous gen.",Negative
Intel,"It'll need to be a custom tooled APU like Aerith/Van Gogh if it is to take full advantage of the 890m.     Nearly all of the configs that release of 16cu Point APU or 40cu Halo will be an APU slapped in a chassis without an adequate power or memory bandwidth setup for the igpu.     What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra. Its desktop tower chip is behind the entry level mobile OS chip from its competitor. It is a decade behind the desktop chips of its competitor, itis hardly Monster class.",Neutral

And AMD ""can make"" such APUs -> PS5 Pro (as a more cost effective solution). AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative
Intel,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",Negative

If Intel can be competitive in the budget market it will at least put a fire under amd to lower their prices/make a better valued product.",Negative
Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't. Problems that Nvidia and AMD both solved decades ago that are holding Intel back in 2024.   It's not a mystery how a GPU should be built but that didn't stop Intel from not figuring it out.,Neutral
Intel,"Installs beta software, proceeds to complain about it",Negative
Intel,Doesn't make it less of a fact that users are experiencing issues and they still paid hard cash for those GPUs.,Negative
Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral

Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so?

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Intel,"And I'm over here struggling to keep an Nvidia T4 passthrough to work reliably on Hyper-V to Ubuntu 22.04. :(  Is there a specific software combination that works more reliably than others?   Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.

Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.  You're free to guess what vendor om looking at to replace my CPU with. Damn shame really.",Negative
Intel,"Fact: AMD does not give a shit about any of this.   We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line. If all CDNA customers switch to NVIDIA and those PO's dropped in volume, it might make them care a little bit.",Negative

I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

Also some other games having driver timeouts to, but i have games that also never timeout.

I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.  Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?

My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

Intel,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there.

So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".

Intel,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

So in the basic but common example above, you can't really complete your job because the entire main system has to be shut down. That's like stranding 6 people because the bus broke down. And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.  I think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable. There need to be a proper high-grade (and low grade) reliable way to avoid that.  Just sucks it took this long, and so much effort to get AMD to pay notice to the issue at hand here.

For context - Unity VRAM usage is - Unity allocating ""how much it want"" and in case of two different GPU Unity may allocate less or more in DX-API, or DX-API have some internal behavior for Unity case on Nvidia so it allocating less.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

But please keep in mind, that its scope is much more narrow than any other open source driver out there. Mostly, it only serves as an adapter between the Linux kernel and GSP firmware. Current Noveau implementations reflect this: GSP features are easier to implement and thus currently more feature complete. And since there is an AI/Nvidia hype train at the moment, they will probably also dedicate more resources into it than say stratis-storage.",Neutral

Intel,"> You state you never had issues, however, how many times have you had a game randomly crash with no error/fault or some random error that is cryptic? How often have you assumed this is the game's fault?  I'm not the guy you're replying to, but for me, almost never.  I've had exactly one driver-based AMD issue - when I first got my 5700XT on release, there was a weird driver bug that caused the occasional BSOD when viewing video in a browser - this was fixed quickly.  My gaming stability issues were always caused by unstable RAM timings and CPU OC settings - since I upgraded to an AM5 platform with everything stock, I'm solid as a rock. My 7900XTX has been absolutely perfect.  There is an unfair perception in gaming with AMD's drivers where people think they are far worse than they really are - it's a circlejerk at this point.  Your issue is different (and valid), you don't need to conflate the known issues in professional use cases with gaming - it'll just get you pushback because people who use AMD cards for gaming (like me) know the drivers are fine for gaming, which makes you come across as being hyperbolic - and if you're being hyperbolic about the gaming stuff, what else are you being hyperbolic about?

Everyone paying attention called this when they revealed Vega, and even long before with the tragic marketing.  Insert the GIF of Raja partying at the AMD event, complete with cigar.  People love coming up with theories as to what critical flaw or failure point caused a given generation of AMD GPUs to suck, and how those will be fixed in the next generation.  From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.  Does AMD need to improve things?  Of course.

And the average joe just doesn't use Linux, if they do, then few of of them actually toy around virtualization, then even fewer of them poke around hypervisors with device passthrough(instead of using emulated devices, which has poor performance and compatibility). It really is the most niche of the niche circle. I'm not looking down on users or playing gatekeeping/elitism but that's just a hard pill to swallow.  But that doesn't mean AMD should be ghosting the issues as people have been expressing their concerns even on datacenter systems where real money flows.  How many r/Ayymd trolls actually know VDI, VFIO and let alone what ""reset"" means?

With how many people this happen with, it is not problem of Adrenalin itself (otherwise it would've been reported A LOT more than i can find).   They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.     From global issues with CPU OC was only one i mentioned. When AMD integrated Ryzen Master, old GPU OC presets did reset CPU OC values to default.

Intel,"lol. Six months late and $300 (60%) over the announced price.  If the dual GPU version was really available for $999 right now (as announced), then Intel would make significant inroads into the local AI market.  As it is, buying this for $800 over a used 3090 is a really hard sell. Compared to a B60, the 3090 is readily available for $1100, and provides the same VRAM, double the compute and memory bandwidth, better perf/watt, and CUDA support.  With the dual GPU cards even at $2k each this does have one single niche - being able to get 144 GB of VRAM in a server at under 1500W for under $10k -  which is legitimately useful for LLM inference.  It's really sad that Intel didn't put in the investment a year ago to have a lot of capacity to produce these now.

Intel,"i'm no expert but i dove in to Wiki      it was a [1GB/s to 3.25GB/s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Link_Interface) interface. For refference PCI-E 2.0 was 1GB/s and 3.0 was 2GB/s BUT per lane so 16 and 32GB/s.  For refference HDMI 1.4 has 10.2Gbit/s  So as i understood it most of the data bandwidth were used for tossing the image output back and forth as only a single card were the one outputting the image (assuming you weren't running tripple monitor widescreen setup on SLI GPU's....) and our image data could more or less saturate the link  someone correct my math if i'm totally bonkers, but 2560x1440p = 3.686 million pixels. each using 24 bit (8-bit color on 3 chanels) which is 88Mbit/s. if you output 60 of those that is 5.3Gbit/s. 1GB/s = 8Gbit/s. Okay okay you wouldn't always throw a full image so lets call it 2.5Gbit. You were still using quite a lot of the bandwidth on the image alone, so from my understanding most of the interface communication was more related to ""who did what"".  and in AFR you would be handing over a full frame.",Neutral

AMD is surely sorely regretting recycling the same 780M and 890M chips for another entire gen, betting that Intel would continue stagnating.  This thing is gonna be a monster in handhelds.  I really, really wanted a Strix Halo laptop, but the lack of SKUs, price and the inflexibility with RAM kind of make it unappealing to say the least, not to mention the power draw compared to Panther Lake is unwelcome. These laptops are gonna be probably the best x86 in mobile has eaten in a very long time.  On top of that, it's almost making the 5050 look like a stupid part in a laptop.

The ultra H 300 has default TDP of 25W, with Maximum Turbo Power (MTP) going up to 65W-80W.

Intel,"Bingo  Strix is also limited by being RDNA 3.5 and no FSR4, so it's rather dependent on raw throughput, and it can't possibly fit in a comfortable handheld that would last for more than an hour and a half under load.  I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage.

And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.  Besides, Intel already has Nova Lake AX in the backlog, or whatever it's going to be called. Practically intel's strix halo. It'll have Xe3P cores, more powerful than Xe3, thus deemed more worthy of the halo treatment.",Neutral

But all I need to know is it's faaar bigger.  >panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus  That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.",Neutral
Intel,"Well Panther uses mixed processes, and hybrid tiles are bound to be a bit less space efficient than putting everything on a single die. And to be fair, Halo GPU uses N4P process while Panther GPU uses N3E So, still not directly comparable.   Gotta say though, Arc's PPA has improved a lot since Alchemist and Battlemage.",Neutral

Case and point, AMD's R9 Fury X. Released with 4096bit bus HBM. Had a total memory bandwidth of 512GB/s. Yet the GTX 980 Ti released with a 384bit bus and 336GB/s memory bandwidth and it out performed the Fury X in pretty much everything.

Amazon [literally warns potential customers](https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/snapdragon-x-powered-surface-laptop-7-gets-frequently-returned-item-warning-on-amazon) about it.  Valve definitely wants a wider adoption rate of SteamOS and ditching x86 is not going to help that. They are **not** Nintendo that can ask devs to target their architecture. It's going well so far because for most games you can just make a standard Windows version, slap Proton and it works within 10% of native performance under optimal circumstances.

Intel,Do we know if we are getting real Nova Lake mobile chips or just a BGA version of desktop parts with a panther lake refresh?,Neutral
Intel,"The DRAM standard between LPCAMM2 and LP-DDR5x is the same - that's the point. LPCAMM2 is a replaceable implementation of LP-DDR5x memory.  But LPCAMM2 is completely different from SO-DIMM. SO-DIMM is DDR5. LPCAMM2 is LP-DDR5x.  You will see Arc B390 designs with LP-DDR5x memory down on the mainboard, and you'll see (some) LPCAMM2 designs, but they'll be far less common.  But you won't see DDR5 SO-DIMM designs - if they claim to be DDR5 SO-DIMM and Arc B390 then its wrong.",Neutral

Intel,"It's not exactly weird. They went PPC before Intel because powerpc was more effective for workloads most people used macs for. The switch to Intel was just because Intel had node leadership and performance leadership. Instead stick to A-chips for low power mobile where intel gave up on servicing. Intel loses node leadership to TSMC for a long time, Apple moves on to everything in-house is a pretty logical progression.  Apple having bespoke solutions isn't new either. they've been doing it since their G workstation days. Their current situation is pretty much on brand for apple, but the difference is the huge mistakes intel made (particularly firing so many top engineers) that led to staff fleeing to other companies, including leadership at Apple processor design.  basically apple did their own thing as usual and did a great job don't get me wrong, not taking anything away from apple. the biggest difference however was intel's CEO and board destroying the company.",Neutral

That said, I’m pretty skeptical about how realistic that is. **With the recent RAM shortages and rising memory costs**, pricing a new card competitively while still keeping margins doesn’t sound easy at all. Memory is a huge part of the BOM, and we’ve already seen how shortages can push prices up across the board.  So unless Intel is willing to take a serious hit on margins (which seems unlikely), I’m not convinced the B770 will land at a price point that truly shakes up the market.

Intel,"u/Chelostyles Thank you for your inquiry regarding the CPU and RAM upgrade for your Dell Vostro 3670. As much as I'd like to provide my technical insights on this upgrade path, I'm not in a position to provide specific suggestions since this involves hardware modifications to an OEM system.  For the best compatibility outcome and to ensure optimal system performance, I strongly recommend reaching out to your system manufacturer directly. They can provide definitive guidance on supported CPU upgrades (i5-8400 to i7-9700) and maximum RAM configurations for your specific model. We don't want to inadvertently bypass any warranty terms and conditions on your system by providing modification recommendations that might affect your coverage.  Your system manufacturer's technical support team will have access to the exact specifications, BIOS compatibility matrices, and supported hardware configurations for your Vostro 3670 model. They can confirm whether the motherboard supports the i7-9700, the maximum RAM capacity (64GB vs 128GB), and any potential limitations or requirements for these upgrades.  This approach ensures you get accurate, manufacturer-validated information while maintaining your system's warranty protection.",Neutral
Intel,"u/I_like_carsyay  XPS 15 9530 hardware does support Resizable BAR, which is why Intel's system detection shows it as available for both your Arc A370M and Iris Xe graphics.

This approach ensures optimal system performance while reducing complexity for users. I recommend checking for the latest BIOS updates from your OEM's support site and contacting their technical support team, as they would have the most current information about how ReBAR is implemented on your specific model and whether any additional configuration steps are needed to fully utilize this feature.     I've posted an article below in case you haven't yet come across it:  **Helpful Resources:**  *  [What Is Resizable BAR and How Do I Enable It?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090831/graphics.html)",Neutral

Intel,"Late to this, but I'm a 13900K owner. I have not had any issues with stability since applying the BIOS update and haven't noticed any performance loss, so I think this is fine. I did not thoroughly benchmark before and after though, partially because of how high peak temperatures were before the update. I am using a Noctua NH-D15 and a contact frame to reduce CPU temperatures.  Up until a few days ago I would have said that thread scheduling isn't an issue, but then I played the game Maneater and it's basically unplayable unless you use launch options to force the game to only P-cores. There's the Intel ""Application Optimizer (APO)"" utility but it seems abandoned and you can't add your own games if Intel hasn't added a profile. I was a big proponent of E-cores but honestly it seems like a half-baked technology that Intel never put the effort in to support properly.

Now I'm not trashing what the B390 will be, because we need an iGPU fight here.  But thinking that the 7600m (non-xt) is only ~15.7% faster than the B390 ((new-old)/old gives percent change) because of Passmark is erroneous.",Neutral
Intel,">I feel like the partnership was an answer to a much broader question concerning both companies, none of it really being an implicit answer to Strix Halo beyond a vague promise to develop custom chips with Intel cores and RTX cores fuse together using nvlink.  They explicitly talk about a client product that will have Intel cores and Nvidia iGPU tiles. It's not especially vague.   >In fact, I might be crazy but I feel like it is more likely that the actual answer to Strix Halo will be all Intel silicon, because Nvidia is very horny for all things ai and all things datacenter.  Despite that, Nvidia has already provided a custom iGPU tile for their Mediatek + Nvidia iGPU solution.   They have both the resources and financial incentive to do this.

I ran my i9-14900k pl on 320 watt and did a cinebench benchmark, temps were ok: average 94c, max 98c with a 360 aio.  That said, go for the cheaper version if you don't need onboard gpu.

Intel,Why not keep pl2 at 253 and 1 at 150/185 ? Did you try undervolting? Most of them can take 50mv offset with 75 /85 needing a bit more stability testing. Can also cap the vr limit and iccmax. I feel like going 150 pl2 makes you miss some performance in games unless you had thermal issues and doing it to keep it from thermal throttle.,Neutral

AMD,"Idk. I have seen serious in depth tests by overclockers, and it seems, 6400 1:1 is the sweet spot. The caveat is, it only makes a serious difference when it's running FPS unlocked and the CPU is near 100%, then the fps gains are very much worthy, like from 120 to 160 and low 1% get better as well. The thing about ram overclocking is that you only really see real gains when the CPU is near max, since the 3XD cache gets full and needs to access memory more (like the other comments clarified).     I like tinkering a little (not an overclocker) and since ram was cheap back then (lol) I got a 6400 kit and run at 1:1. Took time and testing, but I had fun, I guess :P     I think for the most part, the fun part was learning. Now I know a lot more about ram and their settings. However, if I was time constrained and had less patience, I would just run 6000mhz and the lowest CAS I could find at an affordable range.    I play on 4k, doing 6400 1:1 probably didn't even get any fps gains, was just the fun of tinkering and getting my PC to be as good as possible    I avoided Infinity Fabric overclocking and going too low at the secondaries and tertiaries.

AMD,Ain't nobody got time for that and the amount of people that will unknowingly insert instabilities because they don't know enough is just going to be too high.    Reviewers aren't going to review something that an exceedingly small portion of the audience will do.

I guess W11 might be different.",Neutral
AMD,Windows kernel uses 600 MB. everything else is optional.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah no. 16GB is definitely not enough for most people, even with Linux being less of a memory hog.   Most distros definitely don't use less than 1GB when idle unless you remove a bunch of stuff and use very lightweight DEs like xfce or lxqt, and by default Linux is set to use swap whenever memory usage is greater than 60% - which needs a single line of config edit added to the grub bootloader to have it apply persistently.   This is not something your noob user will know about if they switched to Linux recently.",Negative
AMD,"Pepperidge Farm remembers when there were those who argued that throwing a sufficiently fast enough RAM kit (e.g. buy a DDR5-8400 or higher and manually tune it) at a non-X3D CPU could make it competitive against X3D CPUs in gaming.  Well the recent RAM pricing has changed that equation significantly.  EDIT: I'm not sure where to start with finding the post again, but years ago I have seen someone post about their DDR5 kit being run at 9,000 or 10,000 MHz with tight timings and that X3D CPUs were overrated. Turns out they went through multiple 14900Ks on a +$700 Apex motherboard (2-DIMM board specifically designed for RAM OCing) to obtain the result. And they were comparing it against a stock X3D. This was also before the Raptor Lake degradation became widely known.",Neutral
AMD,"It can actually be quite big with non-Vcache chips.  Depends on the specific kit of course, there's more to it than just the MT/s.  Generally the bigger problem with low MT/s kits is that they're some of the lowest quality DDR5 out there and will usually have poor latency as well for overall poor performance.  Like straight up, you can nerf your performance by a whole generation of CPU performance(10-15%) with poor RAM in certain cases.",Neutral
AMD,HUB did some videos proving pretty definitely that DDR5 is a worthwhile upgrade on DDR4 at this point.  It always takes a bit of time for the memory standard to mature and then performance gains become quite real.,Positive
AMD,DDR3 to DDR4 is twice the bandwidth (assuming same timings).,Neutral
AMD,"Even with Zen 2/3, it was still plenty to simply be on 3200Mhz, and anything more was for overclockers/tinkerers.  So not really that much different.    Just like with DDR5, usually 6000Mhz is considered a good sweetspot for affordability and performance.",Neutral

AMD,The X3D cache operates at 2.5 TB/s and DDR5-8400 memory at 67 GB/s per channel.  So you would need DDR5-20000 in an 8 channel setup to match it. It simply is impossible and not even takes into account that much of the X3D performance comes from 10x reduced latency not bandwidth.,Negative
AMD,Friend you're missing a huge asterisks as that uplift is only precent in a very small select number of games.  That reddit is still clueless on RAM scaling baffles me when it's been a discussed topic for as long as I can remember.

AMD,I mean my point is why do such a test and use it as an argument when it's not something most people can or even want to attempt.    I'd still like to see it of course don't get me wrong. Like OCing a CPU on custom loop or liquid nitrogen. Fun to push the limits but lets not pretend it is achievable by most users.,Neutral
AMD,"The amount of people that buy 5090 is significantly higher than the amount of people that tune memory. You could ask instead why they review Intel GPUs.

Next time I have to build a new PC, I'm only going to test XMP/EXPO stability and that's it.",Negative
AMD,"X3D is still limited by Infinity Fabric speed ~70GB/s, so when cache is exhausted (RT, LLMs) the X3D chips are limited by their fabric speed pretty heavily. 14900K will be over 100GB/s with fast ram.  X3D with stuff that can fit in its L3 will dominate, but there are some niches where the old 14900k can out perform due to better available memory bandwidth.",Neutral
AMD,"Honestly i've always overprovisioned my CPU because it's too much of a pain in the ass to upgrade/replace, and by the time i actually upgrade (5+ year cycles) chances are we're on a different socket already so there's no point in upgrading it, so time to get another board+CPU.  That being said, yeah, IMO the PSU is something you should *never* cheap out on. Shitty PSUs take more than just themselves with them to the grave more often than not, absolutely not worth the pittance it costs to just get a good one.

AMD,"Yeah, I recommended a 5600MT/s kit to my brother because it was half the price of a 6000MT/s kit 3 years ago. The FPS for a Ryzen 7600X / RX 7800 XT between those RAM kits were really close, at most 10% but in average 3% iirc.",Neutral
AMD,That actually means you're very much on the same ideal curve.  You're just not as far along on the time axis as some others.  Not a bad place to be really.,Positive
AMD,"Well that's the same as 6400Mhz with DDR5.  Ideally if you could overclock both memory and IF to the same factor, there's a small reward, but 3200Mhz got you most of the way to what DDR4 was gonna deliver for you.",Neutral

AMD,"I hear you, and I raise you my home server running jedec 4800 because I don't wanna mess with it",Neutral
AMD,Sure that is true it depends on the workload. If the workload is load from ram use once and never use again like LLMs (but who runs them on a CPU?) then benefit from X3D cache is none. But most stuff like game engines run a loop thousands of times on the similar data. It does not have to fit in the cache - even if half of it fits this half is already there. So this also benefits the non-fitting half by not competing for memory transfer with it.,Neutral
AMD,"> That being said, yeah, IMO the PSU is something you should never cheap out on.   I did this back in 2015 and now I'm wondering if a PSU ever ages out...",Neutral
AMD,When it comes to gaming i play genres that are CPU bottlenecked so i spend more on CPU than on GPU most of the time.,Neutral
AMD,"Its very interesting to see game engines with x3D. when the model fits entirely inside the 3D cache it runs great, once it exeeds the size and you need to start swapping from memory performance drops off a cliff.",Positive
AMD,"For LLMs or image gen running locally on consumer hardware, you often have to blend the workload and split layers between GPU and CPU (ex: Flux dev FP16 or non quantized models / bigger LLMs) even on a 4090. This uses your CPU and GPU, and then becomes reliant on system RAM bandwidth, while also still giving pretty high performance. It's why people can run huge models on a 4090 and it still be pretty fast. 14900k is better in this case.   Same with RT - in RT games, they seem to miss L3 cache and hit system memory (I don't know why). Granted, most people are GPU bound for RT, so they'll never notice, but technically here the 14900k can also perform better.   Niche stuff that most people won't care about or notice, but still a thing.",Neutral

AMD,"They certainly can, capacitor degradation is a real thing, especially if you are having many transient loads. Also the RTX 30 series and newer are more prone to transient spikes of 2x their rated wattage (e.g. 350W to 600W+ for a microsecond) that can cause Over Current Protection to engage. Not *quite* the same as aging out, but PSUs are subject to the same time decay as everything else and feature enhancement. If you have a newer GPU, it's worht getting a ATX 3.0 or newer PSU, for that plus the native cable to deliver 600W in a single cable for high power GPUs.",Neutral

The 14600K and 285K show similar improvements.  The 9700X also shows good improvement in average FPS, but 1% lows actually decreased.   The 5800X3D shows huge improvements too - from 124 avg FPS to 158; and 1% lows from 89 to 106.   The 7800X3D now achieved \~10fps higher compared to 9800X3D's result in the 33 CPU test video.

We are reaching the point of AMD's Skylake era stagnation where they only release CPUs that offers very little performance uplift over last generation for a lot more power consumption and costs, which is also another reason led me to choose the 7800X3D as my upgrade path from my previous R5 7600.  I think i will be staying on this beast of a gaming cpu until at the least Zen 6 3D or tbh even until AM6 at this point, and i think everyone else with similar gaming performance should as well.",Positive
AMD,"I think the real TL:DR is that you get about 4-5% higher clocks for 25% more power consumption and 10 degrees hotter temperatures than the 9800X3D.  At least when being fully pushed.

AMD,It's still frustrating that Zen 5 seems to \*need\* a lot more than 32MB of L3 to see bigger gains over Zen 4.  At least for gaming.  Basically makes all the Zen 5 lineup except the Vcache parts kind of pointless unless you can get them for roughly the same price as a Zen 4 equivalent.

AMD,The 7800X3D is to these what the 5700X3D was to the 5800X3D. Zen 5 is a pretty flawed architecture because it's gains are limited by some bottlenecks. Zen 6 should alleviate it and addore cores.,Negative

AMD,Such nonsense. It has been 1 release and despite the uplift being relatively low in games compared to other zen releases the 9800X3D is still double digits faster than the 7800X3D. Something that did not happen in the Intel Stagnation Era which went from Sandy Bridge through to Rocket Lake. 11 gens of upgrades.  This is 1 release and a mid cycle refresh because they are getting enough top bins to make it worth selling a marginally higher tier part for a marginally higher price. It is effectively a KS variant but without the huge cost increase.  So saying 1 gen and a KS bin equates to the stagnation era is just absurd.,Neutral
AMD,"Right, but 7800X3D was  450$ on release, every new CPU is going to be terrible value compared to older generations, thankfully AMD isn't Intel so both are on AM5. Prediction time: 10800X3D on release is also going to be bad value compared to 9800X3D",Negative
AMD,"So, AMD releasing a binned CPU for a bit more.... is stagnation.   Meanwhile Intel with the KS series or now the Core 300S aka 200k OC edition, charging 150-300 bucks more per CPU....is innovation in your eyes? Tells me enough lol",Neutral
AMD,"25% more power for 5% more performance looks like a mediocre overclock. Hardware Canucks' review shows how much hotter the 9850X3D is at gaming for barely any performance increase, including the aforementioned power draw increase.  I guess a lot of early 9800X3D buyers might have a sample that can be overclocked to achieve the same or better performance than the 9850X3D, during the launch window they were not binning any CPU whatsoever so there should be a lot of silicon lottery winners out there.",Neutral

AMD,"Yeah I’m hoping to hold onto my 5800X3D until AM6. I know that’s still quite a few years away, but getting in on the start of AM6 and having so many more years of potential upgrades is a lot more appealing than upgrading to one of the last gens on AM5.",Positive

Best part of holding off for that is that if that doesn't pan out I won't be bothered to make a change until the next platform.  If it does I'll make the switch the (x?)x950x3d variant for general compute purposes more than anything (folding @ home mostly).  Either way I'll feel like a winner.

The point is AMD felt innovative with respective performance jump prior Zen 1 - Zen 2 - Zen 3 up until Zen 4 and then Zen 5% comes out and suddenly all of that track record of theirs is broken even the X3D version which everyone liked was not a worthy uplift enough to upgrade from the likes of 7800X3D, and same can be said with 9850X3D compared to 9800X3D - 7800X3D.",Neutral

AMD,"Look at your total system cost, the relative cost of the CPU, and the net impact on performance.  You're looking at a total system cost of... mmm... call it about $3000 for the whole rig. Let's say you're paying $20 more for the 9850X3D than the 9800X3D. That's a 0.7% increase in cost for a ~4% increase in performance, _and_ with that GPU you'll actually be CPU bound enough of the time to make it worth considering.  I would say the 9850X3D is worth it for your rig.  However, it's not a universal truth - if you're running a much older GPU, or have a lower system budget, then something like the 7800X3D makes more sense. On the flip side, if you're playing simulation games like Stellaris or Factorio, then it might be worth the higher end CPU even if you're running older GPUs or lower cost hardware.",Neutral

AMD,AMD really need to put a larger L4 cache on the I/O die.,Neutral
AMD,There's also the potential that Zen 6 may be like the Strix Halo APUs and the higher end RDNA3 parts in that they use Infinity Link (Fanout with 1:1 connections between the chiplets) vs Infinity Fabric (serializes/deserializers which narrow down the communication pathways between chiplets to allow communication over fewer traces).

AMD,"Zen 5 isnt a stagnation per se, nor is the Core stagnant itself.   If it truly were Intels Sky/Kabylake era... A Ryzen 5 wouldnt have been around 10-20% faster in MT/ST every fucking Gen except Zen 5 since that was only a major core and arch overhaul that should have been delayed a year for the overhauled IO Die that comes with Zen 6. Would even say it makes sense its a stagnation in performance in gaming and workloads that DONT use AVX512 instructions.   Stuff that uses AVX512 instructions is a major uplift Zen 4 vs 5 since they broadened the pipelines, as well as doing a true AVX512 implementation.    You could also say, why didnt they use Zen 4/5 Dense instead of the normal Zen Core structure, since it iant missing anything the Big Zen has...  I can tell you, because the performance uplift came from a combination of frequency and architecture itself.  Zen Dense clocks alot lower in some cases, which sure, gives you more cores, but in turn ruins the gains the Arch ITSELF has to offer, which scales with frequency to a certain point.   Then there is also the issue with Zen 5 lacking internal bandwidth and external (DDR5) in 1:1 mode. Which shows up, since a 9950X3D despite lower max boost clock, is faster than the non 3D. Same will be with the 9950X3D2, will be faster, since both CCDs will have access to a big chunk of extremely fast and low latency brick of storage.  Zen 6 will definitely be a massive change, since it comes with a 12 Core CCX, the reworked IO die for alot higher memory speed aka more bandwidth from the get go and a refreshed Arch which takes the groundwork of Zen 5 and iterates on it.   Zen 5 is a stopgap and rework of the old Zen 2/3 Arch.  Its basically what Zen/Zen+ to Zen 2 was. A major groundwork rework, but nothing spectacular for performance.   Imo, calling AMD stagnant like Kaby Lake-Skylake Era is not fair. Especially looking at all the facts, Kaby Lake to Skylake you were lucky to get single digit improvements evey Gen. Which is only true for Zen 5 and only when forgetting that Zen 5 is also used in stuff more than just gaming.",Neutral

AMD,"I’m on the Pro Art motherboard and on a older bios, wondering if I should just leave it as it is",Neutral
AMD,"I have a 9950X3D on the X870e-e R2, have you heard if these issues are present on the R2 version of the board at all? I can't seem to find any reason why they even made a new revision.",Negative
AMD,I bought the same board last week waiting on pricing/availability of the x3d 9850. What m2 slots are you using? The ones covered by the heatpipe are sharing lanes with the x16 slot for some reason,Neutral
AMD,"ASRock has been pretty open about reaching out to AMD, it's just they haven't been receiving any word back. The fact ASUS is involved now, is finally pushing AMD to (hopefully) do something.",Neutral
AMD,"ASRock is taking long because they don't know and can't find the cause. Gamers' Nexus and Wendell from Level 1 Techs are both looking at it as well, more emphasis on Wendell. They can't find anything solid. They can't even reproduce the issue with motherboards that have had CPUs die in them already.",Negative

AMD,"It's Karma, stop kicking puppies!",Negative
AMD,"I updated the BIOS on my MSI board due to memory instability issues, but now there’s another problem with cold boot stutters. I wonder if AORUS/Gigabyte is doing better.  At least ASUS is acknowledging the issue unlike MSI.",Negative
AMD,Friend of mine just updated his BIOS on a Gigabyte x870 which didn't post afterwards. Thought his was another victim of this issue but luckily he was able to do a BIOS recovery and then was able to flash the newest BIOS afterwards. Super strange series of events there and he is a computer guy so I'm sure he didn't grab the wrong file or something dumb.,Neutral
AMD,Why?,Neutral
AMD,"It all depends on numbers.  The Intel issues were big enough that they were noticed by multiple independent third parties, and pretty quickly after release.  And the target reliability can never be 100% perfection, 0.1% of a large number sold can still be a large number of cases.  This is why I'd love people to actually publish numbers, so we can really get an idea of the *real* chances of things going wrong, and not just a collection of anecdotes that may be amplified or ignored depending on the media cycle at the time.",Negative

AMD,My 9950x3d died twice less than 6 months. No overclock only thing I touched was ram expo enabled. On asus 870 tuf,Negative
AMD,>I think it's time for AMD to issue a recall.  How many are faulty vs how many have been sold?,Neutral
AMD,Source on the gigabyte? My search didnt yield anything substantial. Only asus and asrock are dying in bulk. In which asrock bios 3.25 or newer is recommended. Mindfactory rma rate for 9800x3d is close to 0.5% which isnt close to a full recall and nominal.  But my take is that just SoC overvoltage madness that also killed intel chips (which was substantially worse from crash report data)  Edit: found one x870 gigabyte board dead. And in the comments 4 asus motherboards who was RMA'd and bios updated.,Negative
AMD,"They still seem to have a lower rate of reports, which is better than nothing.",Neutral
AMD,"MSI isn’t immune either. My X870 MSI board started having issues with cold boot stutters after a BIOS update, and a lot of people are experiencing the same problem while MSI is ignoring it.",Negative
AMD,It’s AMD lol,Neutral
AMD,"It's possible.  If you run a power-limit-saturating workload with an undervolt, the chip is drawing more current than it does at stock. [Current density drives electromigration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromigration#Electromigration_reliability_of_a_wire_(Black's_equation\))",Neutral
AMD,"Yeh highly highly unlikely, less voltage and lower temps really ain't gonna hurt a CPU.

My current MSI motherboard has issues with randomly stuttering on cold boot, and MSI doesn’t even acknowledge or say anything about the issue.",Negative
AMD,"Wait by ""Sleep Mode"" is that just putting the PC to sleep/suspend thru the OS?",Neutral
AMD,Sleep mode was always fucked due to how much software is allowed to issue random wakes for no good reason. I found it to be a hundred times simpler to just go into idle monitors off mode and leave it spinning.,Negative
AMD,"Sleep is great on my 12600. It used to not wake up rarely in the past, but doesn't do that any more.  But I've also disabled fast shutdown and stopped Windows from updating. So I have a much more stable system.",Positive

AMD,"It's got a decent warranty, no?",Neutral
AMD,I seem to remember ive read something about a particularity/glitch in gigabyte boards and a particular setting in bios that had been giving problems to the point of fucking up some boards for the bunch of people who had to update or modify something in the bios in order to have secure boot and be able to play battlefield 6. I think it was actually 2 settings in there and once you triggered the board would be stuck or some shit like that  I have a gigabyte board and im not planning to update the bios or change anything anytime soon but if I had to I would head down to the gigabyte reddit to ask first because Im pretty sure ive read they have some kind of unique glitch to them  maybe that was the issue your friend was having cause he somehow triggered it,Neutral
AMD,"Intel 13th/14th gen issues hit volume customers, and that's why it gained traction - it had very little to do with the average consumer PC builder's experience, other than it mimicked the kinds of experiences larger datacenter operators and OEMs experienced in their own operations.  Unless the AMD issues rise to that level of impact for any extended period of time, it will likely stay quiet.",Neutral
AMD,Likely intel's microcode killing 13th and 14th gen. It's popular in here to drag 'techtubers' because they say mean things about the mega corps.,Negative
AMD,"So, most weren't using PBO.  I was hoping that wasn't the case, so we could simply not use it and have a bit of piece of mind.",Negative

AMD,Guess we just die then,Negative
AMD,"I hope it isn't AMD because I would be really fucking pissed if I'm sitting on a $3,000 time bomb with an arbitrary fuse.",Negative
AMD,and it was intel not too long ago also.... its almost like they are pre overclocking all the CPU with a boosts and increase voltages to hit peak clock speeds and win benchmarks in the consumer space.  We dont hear about this from either vendor in the server space as they are much more conservative in that regard as stability is #1 priority.  Sadly I think its going to become the new norm.,Negative

AMD,"Thanks, makes more sense now.",Positive
AMD,I never have problem with sleep since 2010s on desktop.,Positive
AMD,"Oh, I do not doubt that poor testing and underinvestment in firmware are common, but that doesn't excuse it.

AMD,of course it doesnt when the sock will randomly run the CPU at 1.55V whatever your settings are.,Neutral
AMD,this is what i did. i set it to 1.22 then disabled PBO.,Neutral
AMD,"Exactly. The issue stems beyond the motherboard manufactures, whether the issue lies within a flaw of the chip or in the AGESA coding for the BIOS.   Edit: Downvote all you want, the issue is on AMDs side when the BIOS updates clearly aren't doing anything to stop the chips from dying.",Negative
AMD,Isn't this stuff the reason they're releasing the 9850x3d?  With the 7800x3d we didn't need a year plus of bios updates or a 7850x3d to fix it since it was genuinely board vendors over-juicing their boards.,Negative
AMD,Everyone? ASRock(Asus) teamed up with Asus to do something? Are we being fr?,Neutral
AMD,"Not since 2007/2008. ASRock was spun off from ASUS around that time period, and became their own company. Both operate under their parent (Pegatron) but are independent from one another.",Neutral
AMD,What does ASUS PR statement have to do with ASRock?,Neutral
AMD,"If you go back and read my first comment, I was talking about ASRock being upfront about reaching out to AMD and not hearing anything back. All you did was quote an *ASUS* comment from the article, which doesn't pertain to ASRock.   So let me get this straight....ASRock, ASUS, MSI, and Gigabyte (few posts but nothing too substantial) are all experiencing issues with the 9000 series CPUs dying right? AMD was blaming motherboard manufactures over the Summer, and each one has released several BIOS revisions that...guess what? Aren't stopping the chips from dying.   Are you going to really sit here, and throw out the excuse that ""Ohhhh r/hardware is just trying to find any reason to blame AMD and throw trash at them!!!"". The fact of the matter is, the motherboard manufacturers don't know what the issue is. So clearly the issue definitely falls on AMD, because nobody knows what the hell is happening.",Negative

AMD,I meant like yes they were spun off but still are quite related. Hell sometimes their boards have very similar defects.,Negative
AMD,did you undervolt or overclocked your cpu?,Neutral
AMD,Now I'm a little worried. I have the X670E-PRO and 9800X3D ... for about 10 months. I have a little bit of undervolt -10mv for a bit of performance boost.,Negative

AMD,"RMA process wasnt bad with AMD, I'd only worry if you bought it used or dont have a valid warranty for some other reason. They ask for proof of purchase and a photo of the product. I gave them a PDF from a downloaded invoice from Microcenter, and a photo of the CPU on its retail box. Turnaround time was 2 weeks.",Neutral
AMD,stock settings are strongly overvolted nowadays.,Negative
AMD,Yeah?? I’m saying static Vcore with a droopy LLC is the only safe way to run CPU’s,Neutral
AMD,"That’s like saying “they are brother and sister… their relation ends at their parents, that’s pretty much it”.  You don’t get much more related as 2 companies than having the same parent company.",Neutral

AMD,6-7% price jump for even 5% performance would still be well under the usual premium charged for Halo products. I'm ok with it.,Positive
AMD,"From what I can see the cheapest 9800X3D right now online (no Microcenter deals) is $469. 6-7% price increase is fine I guess for a rumoured 7%-10% perf jump (usually value decreases for more expensive parts). Then again, I'm sure that the 9800X3D price will drop when this launches, which is welcome I guess. Maybe $400 9800X3Ds? Though that will make the 9850X3D basically DOA.   Checked, and it's at $449 in the Philippines but I guess that's more on our currency dropping in value and stores not updating prices yet lmao.",Neutral

AMD,"That's cheaper than I expected.   I already have a 9800X3D though, so I'm waiting to see if Zen 6 will be worth upgrading to. The rumor mill says they will have +50% cores, so the 10800X3D will have 12 cores and 24 threads, that is going to be upgrade worthy for sure if the price is somewhat similar to current gen.",Positive
AMD,The people who would consider upgrading are priced out of DDR5 so this CPU is DOA.,Neutral
AMD,"Yea, I thought there was no way they'd do 499 -  I mean for one, it's AMD, but a product like this, like a KS, normally has a stupid premium attached.  I'm surprised at anything below 549.",Negative
AMD,"They're hedging against ram prices, good move.",Positive
AMD,>Maybe $400 9800X3Ds? Though that will make the 9850X3D basically DOA.  Products like this are never DOA if they are the best thing available. Plenty of people bought 12/13/14900KS's even though it was the same thing with slightly better binning/clock speeds.,Neutral
AMD,There is zero chance this thing is anywhere NEAR 10% faster unless AMD is putting like twice the power through it.,Negative

AMD,"Yeah depending on your GPU and resolution, and the games you play, you probably get 95% of the gaming performance in real world FPS of the 9850X3D for half the price.  That's money well spent.",Positive
AMD,Well the expensive thing will be DDR5 so the price of this is irrelevant.,Neutral
AMD,"I don’t think there will be much demand, it’s basically just a replacement/refresh of the 9800X3D and most people that wanted one of those already have one.",Neutral
AMD,Amazon drop their stock today and still in stock. That is the price. Delivery date February 1st.,Neutral
AMD,"Nova Lake will basically be a full node advantage.  So in power efficiency, certainty.  In productivity, almost a certainty. You have to go to 9950 to be competitive against the 285HX (although that's on N3B)  In gaming performance, it depends, esp. on how much cache they're going to put on and how much latency their design has.  In terms of price/performance, depends on their yields.",Positive

AMD,All the “tests” of it were just people overclocking 9800X3Ds to match the new speed of this,Neutral
AMD,Are you thinking of the 9**9**50x3D?,Neutral
AMD,AMD’s product cycle for Zen has been pretty consistent at around 18 months. This is confirmation Zen 6 is going to be a little delayed compared to the usual cycle.,Neutral
AMD,"The purpose is that improvements in binning have allowed a clockspeed to only be achieved by a % of 9800X3D's when overclocked can now be achieved by most, so it'll be relaunched with that new clockspeed.  This gives a ""new"" product from AMD to have for the press cycle to cover because we're still several quarters away from Zen 6 (it's no coincidence review embargo for 9850X3D comes the day after PTL's)  It'll also reset ASPs on this product up by $20 without ""raising"" prices",Neutral
AMD,It serves the same purpose as what Intel's i9-KS products did.,Neutral
AMD,> What is the purpose of this product?  Make money,Neutral
AMD,The biggest mistake someone can make is waiting for next generation.,Negative
AMD,sounds like a waste of money to me,Negative
AMD,"imo, the only way that would make sense is if you could use your old cpu in another system.",Neutral
AMD,"The only one that might be worth it is the 9950X3D2 when it comes out, with dual CCD. But even then youre pretty far into niche territory. Youd have to be hitting your CPU pretty hard to max out the 3D V-cache and need a 2nd one.",Neutral
AMD,"Why do you wonder that? Of course you shouldn't. It's not even worth the effort it would take to physically swap the CPU out, let alone the money that will be wasted.",Negative
AMD,People who will spend $500 on a CPU are absolutely not 'priced out' because of memory. :/,Negative
AMD,So people who are already on AM5 but not using X3D yet don't exist?,Neutral
AMD,"I am on 7700X and happy, but I might upgrade to this chip one day",Positive
AMD,"12900K is a different chip (less cache, less E-cores, won't destroy itself, etc.). 13900K/14900K/KS/etc. are the same chip with different binning.",Neutral
AMD,"It wont be 10%, PC's scale more or less pretty linear with performance under normal conditions, a jump from 5.2Ghz all core to 5.6Ghz is a difference of 7-8% at most and that ofc only goes if the CPU is the bottleneck.",Neutral

AMD,"400 with PBO still, you can PBO both chips.",Neutral
AMD,"It's hard to imagine it won't, but that is still rumor.  2-4% gaming improvement and 5-7% productivity improvement isn't exactly a product segmentation step.",Neutral
AMD,8.3 ms vs 0.1 ms reduction in input lag,Neutral
AMD,"Same boat. The 78x3D doesn't get the same praise as the 58x3d, but it's a considerable bump in performance and it uses so little power.   I will run this until whatever the last gen x3d on AM5 is, then probably be able to run that for 3-5 more years.",Neutral
AMD,"Just put 5 times as much DDR1 then, lmao",Neutral
AMD,Zen 6 x3D just needs a 32 GB cache.,Neutral

AMD,"Yeah, the only real market I see for this (other than people strongly affected by FOMO who need the absolute best of the best for their system and upgrade every single time a new part comes out) are people who are just building a new system from scratch and do want the best of the best. And I don't think many people are keen on building with this current market.",Negative
AMD,"I believe they were talking about gaming performance specifically. Since you don't compare 1 SKU to an entire generation like Nova Lake.   But by the time Nova Lake releases, Zen 6 comes under contention as well.",Neutral
AMD,Do you mean 285K? Because from the reports I've seen that's what the 9950x competes with. The 9900x for 265k and such.,Neutral
AMD,"I think Nova Lake is supposed to have an equivalent, bLLC or something like that.",Neutral
AMD,"Nova Lake is supposed to have a large cache variant, although it is not 3D stacked, so the latency advantage of 3D stacking remains to be seen.",Neutral
AMD,Last rumors has Nova-Lake with 144-288 MB of bLLC depending on the model.,Neutral
AMD,"I just want to know if I should wait for Nova Lake or get a 9850. For gaming, ofc",Neutral
AMD,I just saw performance uplift it ain’t worth the return process for it.,Negative
AMD,Maybe so.  All the naming is confusing.  Why would they release a 9950 and 9800 but not a 9850?,Negative
AMD,"Maybe, maybe not. Zen 4 and 5 haven't stopped the seemingly endless Zen 3 releases.",Neutral
AMD,"No? Where did this myth come from, anyway? The idea of constantly waiting for whatever someone thinks the ""next gen"" is, that doesn't make any sense.  I have a 9600X now. A 9800X3D isn't that great when I know that a perfectly good upgrade is coming relatively soon. Zen 6 will also likely be the last gen on AM5, so it's not likely to get better than this. Unless society simply implodes within 2026~2027, we'll be fine.",Negative
AMD,"Nope, I would just sell the 9800x3d for $400",Neutral
AMD,"It's not a matter of how hard you're hitting it, it's the nature of the applications hitting it. Cross CCD latency is [about as ""bad"" as that of going out to RAM](https://www.overclock.net/threads/official-zen-5-owners-club-9600x-9700x-9900x-9950x.1811777/page-53?post_id=29367748#post-29367748) (both are roughly around 75ns or so, vs ~12ns for local L3 Cache), defeating the benefit of the X3D cache entirely. [There are ways to make applications that are able to intelligently allocate their own threads within a given physical CCD](https://chipsandcheese.com/p/evaluating-uniform-memory-access), but as far as I know, the means for that feature set isn't included in AMD consumer chips (there *are* multi-X3D-CCD Epyc CPUs for niche applications). Adding those features to a consumer product would mean AMD undercutting their enterprise products by thousands of dollars per unit.  That's why I'm skeptical of a dual-X3D-CCD consumer part every time it comes up. Even if they do release it, it will have to be aggressively gimped to avoid losing them a ton of money while also being a major disappointment to the people that think they want it. The more likely move would be a 9950X3D with better binned silicon like the 9850X3D is (something akin to AMD's old ""XT"" refresh skews or Intel's ""KS"" models).",Negative
AMD,Says you,Neutral
AMD,"That has nothing to do with what I said. There is a 12900KS, which is  a better binned 12900K.",Neutral
AMD,You wouldn't get a 9850X3D over a 9900X3D or 9950X3D if productivity is the thing you care about.  The 9850 would be for people who would want to pay a premium to have the marginally fastest gaming CPU.,Neutral
AMD,If you care about productivity then this is not the chip for you.  285K is 69% faster MT | 15% faster ST  9950X3D is 76% faster MT | 7% faster ST  Even 265K and 9900X3D are much better options closer to that price range.,Negative
AMD,"is this, like, confirmed?",Neutral
AMD,33% increase in frames v.s 3% increase in frames is another good way to understand why the returns diminish the further you go,Neutral
AMD,"I mean, I don't think thats true. The 7800X3D was unanimously the most praised AM5 chip when it came out and its efficiency was a core reason as to why. It's not as glazed relatively speaking because the 5800X3D was just such an anomaly. It offered 7600X performance to users that didn't want to upgrade to AM5, was very power efficient going against the 12900K, was fairly cheap for what you got AND was dropped mid cycle for AM5 when everyone would've thought AM4 was dead + people were complaining about DDR5 pricing when AM5 launched and this was a saviour.  Like, the 5800x3D really caught a perfect storm. And the 7800 did get surpassed a few years later (even if by a fairly small margin) so it loses that Halo effect for people.",Neutral
AMD,"you need to double the bandwidth for each gen (not exactly so, but a general approximation). So for DDR1 you would need 16 times as much running in 32 channel mode.",Neutral
AMD,"You could also see people who were putting off upgrading from a 7000 series part finally decide to pull the trigger. It's obviously not worth going from the 9800X3D to the 9850X3D, but if you're moving up a generation having a little bump like this can push you over the threshold to buy.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm still rocking a 5800x3d, so yes, I'm considering it. Only if I can get a nice combo deal with the ram though. Maybe won't at all lol",Positive
AMD,"Yeah, likely X3D Zen 6 will be quite a bit after Nova Lake.  So they might take the crown, but that's the one that they have the least chance at IMO.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, sorry, brain fart. I am so sick of the terrible marketing names.",Negative
AMD,wouldnt a side cache introduce same latency issues as going to read the cache from the second CCD? in which case we know this has actual impact.,Neutral
AMD,nova lake is launching in like late 2026 and is a complete unknown  go for 9800x3d/9850x3d,Neutral
AMD,"Just wait, soon we'll have the 9950X3D2",Positive
AMD,"The 9850X3D is just a better binned 9800X3D.  The step above the 9800X3D is the 9900X3D. You get more threads, but lower boost as it's contained within 120 W TDP.  You get 45% more productivity for 7% lower gaming performance or  90% more productivity for like 2% lower gaming performance.",Neutral
AMD,"The Zen 3 parts that are getting released were all manufactured years ago. They just didn't hit requirements, so once enough defective inventory built up, they were released as a new SKU in small numbers",Negative
AMD,I’m in the same exact scenario. I think we can get $400 for our 9800 cpu.,Neutral
AMD,"I mean... yes? That is literally correct, I did say that.  That not withstanding, how do you justify spending ~$100 (provided you get ~$400 for your 9800X3D, and ignoring potential selling fees) for maybe 8% more FPS in the best case scenario? Are you even stressing the 9800X3D with your 9070 XT, or would you land at literally the same performance after the swap?",Neutral
AMD,"No, gaming gains here are irrelevant. Productivity gains of 7% can make enough difference to pay for itself. Productivity is the only scenario where this is useful.",Positive
AMD,Nah but id be very surprised if they weren't like all other Zen 5 chips are able to do.,Neutral
AMD,"Even then, going from 290 FPS to 386 FPS (33% increase) is a much less noticeable change than going from 30 to 40 because it's still a much lower decrease in input lag.",Neutral
AMD,"Makes sense. The 78x3d was certainly very well received. It got buy recommendations from reviewers and it was the top of the line during it's run. I got mine at the low point in it's price history for ~$300, which was a steal imo. I can't imagine anyone with this cpu will feel the need to upgrade (for gaming) for a long time.   I agree that the 58x3d was the perfect cpu for a perfect situation.",Positive
AMD,"Well, then just don't put any DDR ICs on your board, boot up from on-chip memory with a minimal bootloader, and download some more RAM onto the board from one of those webpages.",Neutral
AMD,No problem. Laptop SKUs are especially confusing.,Negative
AMD,Depends on the interconnect no? From what I know infinity fabric is the only thing that prevents cross die memory access for AMD.,Neutral
AMD,"I mean this is the same thing, they just built up enough inventory of good 9800X3D bins.",Neutral
AMD,Productivity more so cares about multi core performance and you wouldn't pick a 8 core CPU with somewhat better single core performance over a 16 core CPU like the 9950 with more than 50% higher performance.  Gaming gains are marginal/irrelevant but they will be the reason people will buy it for and it is also how it is being marketed.,Neutral
AMD,"True, I just think the raw percentages are easier for most people to understand.   Modern computing really is a marvel man. If you would've told 14yo me that one day I'd have a CPU / GPU that crushed basically everything at 1440p 180Hz and wasn't even technically the top end I would've shit lol",Neutral
AMD,"Definitely a steal. That's near 5700X3D cheap for like 30% better performance and more upgrades available.  I wouldn't be surprised if the 7800X3D lasts a decade. Though, the rumoured increase in core counts for the next gen does make it a tad less likely. It's still gonna last a damn long time though.",Positive
AMD,"Also bought it at around its all time low, had no idea. It was in May 2024 if I remember well.  Bought it because the relatively recently released Helldivers 2 was obliterating my ole trusty i7-8700, the GPU was twiddling its thumbs at as low as 35% usage.  I was considering waiting for the 9800X3D, glad I didn't.",Negative

AMD,"Summary:  “While the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 was faster overall, the Framework Desktop was consuming more power than the Dell Pro Max GB10. On average the Framework Desktop over this entire span of CPU benchmarks saw an average wall power reading of 133 Watts with a recorded peak of 227 Watts. The Dell Pro Max GB10 meanwhile had a 103 Watt average with a recorded 164 Watt peak for all of these benchmarks. So while the Framework Desktop performance geo mean was at 1.285x, the total system power consumption was 1.29x higher on average and the peak was 1.38x.  If you are investing in the Dell Pro Max GB10 or any other GB10 platform, chances are though you are running AI workloads and other software fully engaging both the CPU and GPU. The Blackwell GPU with the GB10 offers a lot more compute potential over the Radeon 8060S graphics but similarly the Dell Pro Max GB10 pricing is around $4139 USD as of writing and the Framework Desktop around $2928 USD if going for the same RAM and storage capacity. More GB10 GPU benchmarks are on the way at Phoronix.”",Neutral
AMD,I have GB10 in my lab. The real issue with my unit is thermal throttling.  When it reaches 70C throttling kicks in and the performance drops a lot. Forcing additional air using a mini blower it maintains much higher interference tokens/s.,Negative
AMD,The GPU portion will be the juicy bit,Neutral
AMD,"As someone who's mostly into applied math and stats research rather than hardware, I'm always a bit confused as to how to parse these for my own use cases. Which of these benchmarks correspond to decomposing thousands of large matrices/arrays in parallel using Python or R (which I suppose use LAPACK or something like that in the backend)?",Neutral
AMD,"Not mentioned here, but when you start going concurrent performance testing, via vLLM, the GB10 ends up being 4x to 5x faster than the Strix Halo (which itself can be quite faster with concurrency).",Positive
AMD,"The lack of a real efficiency advantage was baffling given Nvidia/Mediatek are using an N3 node. You'd expect higher efficiency, not the same (Halo has +28% geomean performance at +29% avg power consumption).   Obviously the Nvidia chip focus is more on the GPU though.",Negative
AMD,[That was the prior article](https://www.phoronix.com/review/dell-pro-max-gb10-llama-cpp).,Neutral
AMD,"PETSc is functionally somewhat in that field: https://petsc.org/release/manualpages/   Video encoding is a massive matrix calculation session, but usually using heavily optimized assembly over standard libraries that you'd use.

AMD,"That might simply be due to the fact that Strix Halo has a much wider CPU. It's 16 Big Cores + SMT. So at a given wattage, Strix Halo can run at lower clock speeds and thus match the efficiency of GB10.  It also does not help that GB10 is using a generation older ARM CPU cores, with less cache and a strange cluster arrangement to top it all.",Neutral
AMD,The GB10 devices come with ConnectX card that is probably responsible for some 5-10W of base load.,Neutral
AMD,DGX Spark power management is uhh a tad lacking and comes with... oddities.  It has a tendency of putting itself in really deep power states too eagerly while taking a while to wake back up: https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/connectx-7-nic-in-dgx-spark/350417/51  Wonder how much that might have affected perf results for some subtests. It _should_ have no impact on number crunching style workloads though.,Negative
AMD,Perhaps better optimisation of x86 code?,Neutral
AMD,I think you are underestimating Mediateks architectural prowess here. They know how to make tiny microcontrollers. They dont have good record with CPUs. And Nvidia here is likely not doing the designs outside of the GPU.,Negative
AMD,"I know, it deserved its own thread on here too. I think it didn’t get one.",Negative
AMD,"Video encode uses simd on cpus, but doesn't do much where fast matrix multiplies would be helpful.",Negative
AMD,"GB10 has 20 cores, although it's fair to point out half of those are small-ish A725 cores.",Neutral
AMD,You're forgetting 1 thing. Finflex.,Negative
AMD,"5-10W sounds low to me. Removing the DAC cables only strips off 4W right now, it's more in the 20W range eaten by the NIC.  That said the next major kernel update for it will address things hopefully by allowing the NIC to actually go in a lower power state: https://github.com/NVIDIA/NV-Kernels/commit/18a062fe0c4965eb6a2ddddfe8de8e465d05a98e",Neutral
AMD,The ConnectX card is the big difference maker in value as well. Connecting two is a pretty easy upgrade. If you were going to get only one then Strix Halo would be a better pick if you don't need something Nvidia specific. Even more so before the RAM prices really drove up pricing on the Framework.,Positive
AMD,"> although it's fair to point out half of those are small-ish A725 cores.  More than fair. An A725 in the GB10 has half the ST perf of their X925s, though the gap may close in nT workloads depending on how high each core is boosting there.",Neutral
AMD,Which is offset somewhat by lack of SMT and IPC of an older arm architecture,Negative
AMD,what about it?,Neutral
AMD,"Yep, the GB10's A725 are only paired with 0.5MB L2, that'd be barely larger than 1mm2, i.e. far smaller than Zen5C, similar to Intel's Mont cores  That's the same L2 MediaTek uses for the E-Cores/little-Cores (A720/C1-Pro) in their D9400/D9500  Also the GB10 has a weird asymmetric L3 cache. One X925+A725 cluster has access to 16MB L3, the other X925+A725 cluster has access to only 8MB L3. Whereas [each of Strix Halo's 8C clusters has their own 32MB L3 each](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OGNa!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbc6d88c-c362-4ea6-8a86-f677313342a1_1600x1016.png)  Don't think they've released die shots yet, but the GB10's is probably around 50mm2 (estimated from the D9400/D9500). Strix Halo's CPU probably is about 2.5x larger with about 1.5-2x more transistors once accounting for N3 vs N4",Neutral
AMD,"I mean, the reality is that it is just a quick and lazy refresh right? the two chips are pretty much identical, just with higher clocks.     You'd assume that as a ""flagship"" level chip initially, AMD didn't leave too much performance on the table",Neutral

AMD,Cool beans my over clocked 9800x3d is essentially the same thing. FOMO avoided.,Neutral
AMD,Isn't that a kind of stupid take coming from a channel mostly dedicated to OCing???,Negative
AMD,Sure. Who cares though? It's like saying the 5090 would be a lot more efficient at 450-500W for 5% less performance. People who bought it don't give a shit. People who will buy this won't give a shit either.  Almost everyone would be much better served with a 7500F or 9600X and putting the spare $250 to almost $400 in the 7500F's case towards a way faster GPU. That's the difference between a 9060 XT 8GB and a 9070 XT.,Negative
AMD,"those ""new"" products like Ryzen 9850X3D or Gorgon Point are just stupid and pointless and it's an objective fact  they are only making bad press for themselves, people then saying they release same thing twice under different names",Negative

AMD,50% less likely to fail probably.,Neutral
AMD,Amd the masters of doing the bare minimum when they're ahead.,Neutral
AMD,when they start releasing bioses for it ?,Neutral
AMD,AMD stagnation in full view. Only took them 5 years of minimal competition to turn into an old Intel mirror.,Negative
AMD,Top end of GPUs and CPUs has usually been like this.  The only way companies might not create a product that operates far beyond the efficient range of the architecture is if they lack competition for the performance crown.,Negative

AMD,"Truly AMD's Kaby Lake moment right here lol, undeniably so.. But the sad truth is this product is aimed at people who doesn't care about their money / value and wants the best of the best no matter what, will still buy this, especially over the current 9800X3D which was also a poor value compared to its predecessor 7800X3D that is often on sale around less than $300.",Negative
AMD,"It's not a huge performance uplift, but it's still better than when Intel does their KS CPU's, that only offer 1-2% uplift for $110 more.  AMD gets a little respect for only charging $30 more than the 9800X3D at launch. And simultaneously lowering the MSRP of the 9800X3D.",Neutral

AMD,I wonder how the 9900x3d2 will be,Neutral
AMD,"Still better than when Intel does KS CPU's, with just 1-2% performance improvement. AMD's CPU's are at least efficient as standard, when Intel ""wrecks efficiency"", it's on a CPU that already uses 250+ watts as standard.",Positive

AMD,The flagship is the Ryzen 9 tbh,Neutral
AMD,"Its just the same chip but factory overclocked.  As for leaving performance on the table, remmeber x3D memory usually had heat dissipation issues which made AMD be more conversative on all the x3D chip clocks.",Neutral

AMD,Same silicon,Neutral
AMD,Hopefully this doesn't have the same exploding problems.,Negative

AMD,"Yeah even a slight UV + curve optimizer will get you there. Perhaps at a better power consumption also.  At least you know you are getting a better bin of the same chip, if you are an OC or even UV maniac. And it's not $80+ more.

AMD,A lot of his review content isn't just for some OC audience but relates to usefulness for everyday people.,Positive
AMD,"I'm sure detailed testing videos will follow, it's just a short day one review which is supposed to be informative for people eager to find out if they pull the trigger or or not on buying.  I think his second or third video dedicated to the 5090 was also showing the efficiency gains simply by reducing the power target.  And he has a point. High end hardware releases are just stupidly inefficient. GPUs have been like that since Ampere and RDNA2, Intel went crazy with Alder Lake and threw sanity out of the window with Raptor Lake (S) and this just points out how pointless this CPU is for 99.5% of people, it's just a factory overclock.",Neutral
AMD,the statement is equivalent to there's no oc headspace on the silicon so it's piss poor efficiency. that's not stupid at all.,Negative
AMD,"He said in the video he ran out of time to do that, but it is coming in the next video.",Neutral
AMD,Yes. He has to twerk for Zaddy Bu and Jensen (by shitting on AMD) otherwise they won't give him free shit,Neutral
AMD,"I mean... there is a reason why OCing is done PER CHIP and PER YOUR SETUP no?  you tweak your own chip to perform the best under that condition with your desired parameters, some does outright ghz battle, others prefer lower volts and heat for xyz perf, others want a certain level of performance and then tweak the other stuff.  when you do something like this, you have to hit EVERY CHIP in EVERY SET UP with a hammer to try and squeeze out that bit of performance, it can be on some dinky air cooler that barely cool the thing, or an AIO that can cool it fine, or its on a custom cold plate for the chip in a custom loop and maybe even de-lid and all that.  its more like hey, this is kind of stupid, if you want to OC, do it the proper way with this kind of tuning and if you DO need 25% more power to hit 4% gains, maybe reconsider.",Neutral

AMD,It's a good plan.  No one will be building systems for the next 2 years thanks to ram and storage prices.  A zen6 drop in for existing systems is all we can hope for.  And zen6 on AM4 would be above and beyond.,Neutral
AMD,Are you expecting them to release a new architecture every year? Since when has that been the standard?,Neutral
AMD,"Eh, to be fair they're not advertising this as a new generation like Intel has done multiple times.  9850x3d's name alone shows that it's just a tuned 9800x3d and the price matches that.  The #1 best of anything always has a premium since you can't get to that level of performance otherwise.

AMD,"Just built my new high end pc yesterday, loving it so far but I’m still setting it up and getting everything to work properly.  But I spent 700-800 euro more than I would have a few months ago, mainly due to RAM, 64GB cl30 6000mhz. That was with me going crazy to scour everywhere for products that hadn’t hiked in price yet, managed to get a 4tb nvme for the original price although it was the gen5 so it was still expensive, got my PNY 5080 for pretty close to the lowest price it ever was at (1200 euro instead of 1100 euro). RAM was 680 instead of 200 but it’s still hiking so got a relatively good deal as most RAM had already increased beyond that.  The rest didn’t really increase much in price. Searched as much as I could and managed to get some well known quality components for lower than normal price.  So, I spent around 700-800 more now, but ig I had waited a month or two, I’d have to spend 1000-2000 euro more for the exact same build in addition to that…   crazy that a mere 64GB RAM is getting as expensive as a 5080…",Positive

There will never be a time when it becomes 3x as fast. Even from the 8-core 7700X, you need to jump up 65% to get to the 9800X3D.  It is not good value by any measure. It just doesn't cop any flak because it is the best of the best for people who want nothing but the best.

Forget about specific wattage figures - both sacrifice efficiency such a small performance improvement, you have to measure it to detect it.  The performance and efficiency we see shouldn't even require testing - as soon as we got leaks of a 9800X getting a mild clock speed bump, we already knew exactly what this part was gonna be.  But also, so what? Neither Intel nor AMD are forgoing other products because products like this exist. They're just bins of existing production.

If they want the best high end value that still gets high fps and can go head to head against the best and is only marginal slower? the 7800X3D simply is a far better deal out of the other options, even HUB said this very same thing on the conclusion of their 9850X3D review.",Neutral

I’m not the target audience for these technologies, but the way people gush over them puts me right back to my original statement.   I’m blind.",Negative
AMD,DLSS 4.5 wins the majority of times but also has some issues of its own.  FRS4 and DLSS4 are generaly worse and trade blows depending on circumstances. FSR4 does some stuff better. Even close to DLSS4.5 while in others its even behind DLSS4. There's even cases where the choice literally comes down to prefference.  Either way I think at this point all 3 upscalers are more than good enough for general use purposes and your average person will not really notice most artifacts in them without really focusing on them.

I dislike that approach, cause you can use RIS 2 or rCAS via ReShade to make FSR 4 just as, or even more (over)sharpened, but there's no good way to remove the oversharpening DLSS 4 and 4.5 introduce.  AMD needs to clean up the fence and stair stuff though. Those are very obvious problems with the upscaler, and improve the ghosting in future iterations.  DLSS 4.5 also has some problems with global illumination flickering in dark environments, which oddly weren't mentioned here. Not sure HUB is aware of those shortcomings of DLSS 4.5.",Negative

AMD,"Yep, it's been over a year and we still have to rely on a third party software in able to use it. I'd say too that is the current biggest drawback of FSR 4 right now is only supporting very minority RDNA 4 only GPU architectures, compared to DLSS's much bigger all generations of RTX GPU from 20 - 50 series generations.

AMD,"You're perfectly normal. There's a reason all these comparison slow down and zoom everything (not that I've watched this one, but I assume it conforms to all the others).",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, diminishing returns is for sure happening, especially as better techniques have so far been going side by side with a need for more compute power.   I think we are going to continue to see new models that improve things, but I think this 4.0/4.5 dilemma is always going to be there, a ""pick your poison"" in the type of artifacting you're willing to accept in order to eliminate the other types of artifacting.   The Digital Foundry assessment kind of demonstrates this when they surmise that the ""over-sharpening"" in some titles may be a side effect of training the models to eliminate ghosting.",Neutral
AMD,"I'd put DLSS 4 pretty decently ahead of FSR 4 as a current 9070 owner upgrading from an RTX 3080, having a lot of time spent looking at both. FSR 4 feels much more comparable to DLSS 3, I really hope AMD brings us something big with FSR 5.",Positive
AMD,">Either way I think at this point all 3 upscalers are more than good enough for general use purposes and your average person will not really notice most artifacts in them without really focusing on them.  This is probably true on 4K but on resolution like 1080p - 1440p i personally can still easily distinguish the difference between these upscalers, heck even with DLSS 4, the 4.5 is a noticeable visual upgrade when comparing the newer 4.5 Preset L / M Ultra / Performance mode vs older DLSS 4 Preset J / K Balanced / Quality mode.",Positive
AMD,"I also think that DLSS 4.5 is a step in the right direction, but there are a few stuff that needs to be fixed, which most likely will be in DLSS 5.0",Positive
AMD,"I've tested it in Cyberpunk on the 9070 XT and FSR4 is noticeably better. A couple times I installed OptiScaler which defaults to XeSS output and forgot to change the setting at first and thought WTH is wrong with setup this looks like crap, then remembered to toggle FSR4 output in OptiScaler. It's really not even close.  Edit: I just took an imgsli to show the difference, but it's hard to make out a lot from the screenshot. What you'll see is that FSR4 is generally more detailed, but it's subtle. Anything in movement though, which of course the imgsli does not capture, is much more detailed on FSR4 with no ""TAA blur"" where XeSS is extremely soft as soon as you move. https://imgsli.com/NDQ1Nzcw",Neutral

AMD,> but there's no good way to remove the oversharpening DLSS 4 and 4.5 introduce  DLSSTweaks has an option for that.,Negative
AMD,"The oversharpening truly is horrible and I don't see it being mentioned enough. HU also disappointingly called 4.5 ""even sharper"" when it's just ""sharpening filter"" being applied with little actual texture clarity being introduced. Rachet and Horizon examples are especially outrageous at how much of a downgrade 4.5 is if you don't want any of this being applied (all other improvements put aside).",Negative
AMD,Its not oversharpened. Its just that you are used to everything being blurry before we got DLSS to fix that.,Neutral
AMD,"27:01 *""I have heard from some people that would like us to look into Preset L with DLSS 4.5 as well so hopefully at some point we'll be getting to that looking at it compared to preset M and also FSR4""*  HUB will test it when they have the time. When that'll be who knows.",Neutral
AMD,"It looks sharp, but not oversharpened IMO, at least in few examples I've tried. Anecdotal - in RDR2 on 1440p Preset L made Ultra Performance (480p internally) look pretty adequate, even if with some noticeable artifacts here and there. But overall image coherency is astonishing, and I can see myself playing that way if required.",Positive
AMD,"Game dependent. Even when you set the in game sharpness to 0, DLSS 4.5's artificial sharpening filter may still introduce oversharpening and ringing artifacts in some games. It's a mixed bag really. I'd say if the game already looked sharp enough with DLSS 4.0 then 4.5 will definitely look oversharpened. If you don't wanna worry about it just stick to preset K until NVIDIA adds a sharpness slider or tones down the sharpness in a future update.",Neutral
AMD,"Video will give you a good idea already.   Just dont use Balanced/Quality.  Performance mode seems to generally be ok in most games, though can still be slightly oversharpened in certain games.",Positive
AMD,"1440p monitor here (i use my 4ks only for productivity because they are low refresh rate). It looks fine, better than native for me.",Positive
AMD,"Yep, it does really not look good from videos. I don't know if it's genuinely less noticeable in person or people just love oversharpened images. I have a feeling it's the latter, hence every TV and phone camera oversharpening every image by default.",Negative
AMD,I don't think AMD cares too much about the GPU gaming division anymore,Neutral
AMD,"This has been a never ending story with DLSS and FSR lol. Even Intel, a newbie in the DGPU industry managed to beat AMD in the upscaling game.",Neutral
AMD,"Funny, the 117p upscaled to 1080 actually looks playable on DLSS 4.5",Positive
AMD,"But once you get to a good enough stage, any more wouldnt sway people much",Neutral
AMD,This is a massive hyperbole considering FSR4 already trades blows with DLSS4 in most cases. Its even better than DLSS4 in certain instances.  You comment would be more fitting for when AMD only had FSR3. That one really was a generation behind.,Neutral
AMD,"And the problem is that fsr4 is built on a hybrid between CNN and transformer, and we know the CNN model is limited, while dlss's full transformer model has very high potential",Negative
AMD,"It feels wrong to say this, but: kudos to NVIDIA for taking that mess of AA techniques and setting a new standard regarding visual quality, along with a performance boost.",Positive
AMD,5070ti was $300 more in your area?,Neutral
AMD,"I have two 9070XTs and had a 5070Ti for a while, and the two upscalers prioritise different things like DLSS looks better on the horizon and fine detail in far midrange, but FSR4 looks better close to the camera especially in fast motion. Nvidia have other advantages like less flickering shadows in trees in some games. But in a blind test most people will not see the difference between FSR4 and Dlss4  I personally preferred FSR4 in third person games and dlss in first person games, but generally I turn off upscaling, or use downscaling in those anyway. Edit: also the oversharpening on Nvidia is too much for me",Neutral
AMD,Overpriced is an opinion,Negative
AMD,2kliksphilip video?,Neutral
AMD,"I'm running L balanced or performance at 1440p on most games with a 5060 ti 8gb. The card has plenty of tensor core power to run the heaviest DLSS model. Then framegen gets my 60 fps up to my monitors 200hz.  Honestly DLSS is a godsend for low vram cards, as the newer models allow much lower resolutions while somehow looking better than older models at quality. It gives the card something to use its muscle on instead of just being vram constrained and running at 70% utilization.   I still have to turn textures down sometimes but the lower resolution from DLSS is often the difference between medium and high textures running smoothly.  Everyone dumped on the 8gb card but if you look at what cards are actually going for now (not the msrp) it's actually not bad. The 8gb version is available for $330 while the 16gb is $520. That's a $200 difference and in well optimized games there is literally no performance difference. For heavy games you have to compromise on textures vs the 16gb version, so that's what you lose for your $200. For $330 and combined with dlss it's not terrible, especially if you want an esports card it will easily get you 200+ native fps on cs/fortnite/valorant etc.",Positive
AMD,"Huh? it has no way to inject FSR 4 on vk because it's Vulkan, not because of AC. People are running Opti with VK spoofing and dx11-on-12 just fine. FSR 4 with dx11 on 12 also works, but wonky to my eyes and I can't put a finger on it",Negative
AMD,I've been using optiscaler in that game just fine. The devs don't really care you can use it.,Positive
AMD,"Been using OptiScaler with Diablo 4 for 80 hours across 3 months and no anti-cheat issue. Of course there's a risk, but I honestly have not heard of a single confirmed case of somebody being banned for anti-cheat detection of optiscaler.",Neutral
AMD,You can update dlss to the newest one in the nvidia app,Neutral
AMD,"I wonder what will happen when PSSR2 comes to consoles. That should significantly expand support and might even get FSR 4 some much needed attention when implementing it. Currently, FSR suffers from issues in its implementations not due to the quality of the upscaler itself but because devs won't fine tune it like they do DLSS.",Neutral
AMD,>FSR4 will probably be pretty well supported going forward  Will it? Games keep coming out with DLSS but not FSR and this does not seem to be stopping.,Neutral
AMD,">but I think this 4.0/4.5 dilemma is always going to be there, a ""pick your poison"" in the type of artifacting you're willing to accept in order to eliminate the other types of artifacting.  But if we look back to the DLSS2/FSR2 days, it's pretty clear that whichever 'poison' you pick, things have definitely still improved a lot and you'll be dealing with less artifacting overall.   So long as progress keeps going, I think the actual compromises you have to make going with one or other will become increasingly negligible as well.",Neutral
AMD,The returns are in extreme scales. There were tests done where they upscaled from 480p and DLSS 4.5 handled that just fine. Even upscaling from 117p looked playable. The returns are now in how far we can scale rather than image quality.,Neutral
AMD,DLSS 4 is definitely sharper but FSR 4 is more consistent for me. A few games have issues with transformer DLSS. Not really an issue with so many models available on the NVIDIA side though.,Neutral
AMD,We have enough video evidence to believe FSR4 is closer to DLSS4 that we don't have to go with your anecdote or vibes.,Neutral
AMD,"I'd probably put it as:  DLSS Transformer Gen 2 > DLSS Transformer Gen 1 >> FSR4 >> DLSS CNN >>> FSR 3.x  Imo overall FSR4 is decently better than FSR4, but it's definitely not on the same level as DLSS 4",Neutral
AMD,FSR5 is coming already?,Neutral
AMD,"Who upvotes these anecdotes that everyone knows are just wrong? Every single comparison by HUB or anyone else between DLSS3 and FSR4 has put the latter far ahead but sure I guess we ignore the testing and trust you ""as a 9070 owner"" lol  In most cases FSR4 is as good as DLSS4 and there are occasions where it is as good as 4.5",Negative
AMD,"That's not true, FSR4 is significantly superior to DLSS3. You just like the sharpness of DLSS4... Turn on RIS2 Adrenaline in the global profile to about 50%.",Neutral
AMD,"As someone who finds disocclusion artifacts very annoying, FSR4 places massively ahead of DLSS 4 for me. DLSS 4.5 does look like a decent step up from FSR4 though.",Neutral
AMD,"He said the average person. If you're posting on a tech enthusiast forum and watching videos about upscalers, you are not the average person.    Ever talk to a truly casual PC gamer? They buy prebuilts and don't even attempt to mess with visual settings. You could show them DLSS 4.5 vs TAA side by side and they'll say something like ""ehhh it looks a bit sharper I guess"". This is not a dig at them btw, they just prioritize vastly different things when playing games.",Negative
AMD,XeSS on Intel is better but still slightly behind FSR4 (I think),Neutral
AMD,"Doesn't HUB already disable sharpening in their videos? Pretty sure they've said they set it to zero in all their comparison videos. If it was a default options, wouldn't DLSS CNN be oversharpened too in their 3 vs 4 comparisons, since they use the same settings there?",Neutral
AMD,"It is. If you compare it to brute force supersampling, it doesn't look like that. All the vegetation has clear oversharpening grain artifacts, they are very easy to spot if you've dealt with them before.  There's no way you can tell me the TLOU1 and HFW foliage isn't oversharpened. It looks horrible. I'd honestly prefer it being a bit soft than oversharpened.",Negative

AMD,"It's not Playstation, they have their own implementation libraries for PSSR, even though the underlying model and algorithm will be shared with FSR/Redstone.  It's Xbox. When they move to be just a windows PC - using PC versions of games with PC graphics settings, there should be a big push to get FSR4 on everything to make it ""Xbox"" ready.",Neutral
AMD,"For the most part, yes.  Occasional new games dont have FSR, but most do.",Neutral
AMD,"Oh yeah, when I say diminishing returns, I just mean in the scale of inconsistencies will likely always exist no matter how much power you throw at it, and we will likely never see a leap with DLSS 5 like we did with past models. But by the same lot I can see DLSS 5 or 6 being a case where you need to really focus on select cases to still see shimmering or incorrect particle effects.  Realistically, we've already past the point of ""good enough"" as far as I'm concerned. In most games already, the issues are minor enough and a good tradeoff of forced TAA that I am always trying to decide whether to play in Native or DLSS depending on the title. Three years ago I wouldn't even consider it.",Neutral
AMD,the evidence suggests FSR4 is a bit better than DLSS3 but not encroaching on DLSS4.,Neutral
AMD,"Not yet and they're probably gonna call it something else. FSR4 was already renamed to ""FSR Redstone"".",Neutral
AMD,"No, they just mean whatever comes next.  They will obviously keep improving FSR.  Reconstruction is going to be a mainstay of 3d graphics going forward now and clearly has a lot of value.",Positive
AMD,"Not true. Every review put it at ""Between 3 and 4 but closer to 3"" from what I remember.",Neutral
AMD,They upvote it because they like the way it makes them feel.,Neutral
AMD,"Not true, FSR4 is slightly superior to DLSS3, but closer to it than DLSS4.  Sharpness is good. Sharpness used to be known as actually being able to see the details. That is before TAA smearing vaseline on the screen became popular.",Positive
AMD,"Some games DO NOT allow you to adjust the sharpening filter that devs apply for DLSS. Some games allow it in settings, others bury it in the config files for the game and for some it's hardcoded and has no setting or config. DLSSTweaks (maybe even SpecialK) allows you to change it no matter what.",Negative
AMD,Some games ignore your sharpening settings. Remmeber that all those settings we have used to just not be accessible by players and ran on developer defaults. Some developers still dont want users to have a choice.,Negative

AMD,"I prefer DLSS  model M at 1440p over  most of the native TAA implementations . I don't even use DLAA anymore , as it just uses more resources and I don't notice any difference vs DLSS quality",Neutral
AMD,"And they have been steadily losing dGPU marketshare for equally long.   It took them this long to get an AI upscaler out and didn't even bother to implement it for older GPUs, so people need to use 3rd party injectors",Negative
AMD,which came after Sony kicked AMD in the ass to get on and enter the 2020 decade finally.,Neutral

AMD,"So no non-""premium"" laptops with AMD APUs or handhelds with AMD APUs will support FSR 4 until 2029?  That seems quite pointless. If there's any laptops that would need upscaling the most, it'd be the lower-end ones with *less* iGPU performance. The ones doing 60 are fine as is.

AMD,"What's crazy to me is that one of RDNA3's biggest issues was how inefficient it was in utilizing its theoretical compute and bandwidth advantages.  And RDNA4 fixes that!  You'd think this would be perfect for a bandwidth-limited processor like an iGPU.  My best guess is still that they didn't realize how good RDNA4 would actually be, and perhaps thought their RDNA3 issues would take more to deal with.  The fact that the desktop lineup is basically only one GPU die, and then another GPU that's essentially just the one copy/pasted and glued together, along with this constant reuse of RDNA3.5 for mobile/APU's tells me they really didn't invest much into RDNA4's success at all.  Which is especially lousy for people who are really enjoying the PC handheld stuff nowadays.  I'm not one of them, but still, I'm sure RDNA4 would have been a nice improvement on this side of things.  But now it seems like Intel might be able to come in and scoop up attention for people wanting something newer and better.",Negative

AMD,"Quoting myself:  > My guess, based on what AMD has said about RDNA4 and UDNA, is that they didn't put the R&D into cutting RDNA4 down any smaller for iGPU usage. So far RDNA4 only has 2 die configs, 64 and 32cu. The 32cu config is exactly just 1/2 of the symmetrical 64cu config. And if you look at the die diagrams, it would take significant redesign to cut the size down further, far enough to fit into the space of 8-12cu RDNA3.5 spaces. >  > My guess is that UDNA is being designed for all sorts of configs, but has caused problem after problem for them...

And for the low end APUs, even if they were a newer RDNA version, they wouldn't be fast enough to run FSR4 well.  (not enough compute power).

AMD,Depends what is their actual intent. They can move HX 370 to a lower price point and release RDNA 5 new thing at it original price point. That way you get more performance for budget options and more performance at the high end. Both companies refresh old generations within their new generation to have lower price options available.  Also it may be that they want to prioritize raster performance instead of DXR or fancy AI upscaling for their lower tier solutions. RDNA 3.5 got a lot of ISA changes also present in RDNA 4 but not all of them so it looks like some tailored solution.,Neutral

If the current IT scene was not ridiculously hostile for us end-users then these times would be exhilarating with powerful ultrabooks, mini PCs, handhelds, consoles with real 4K60 support, VR/AR sets and higher fidelity&quality graphics with ray/path tracing.  I am not against software based upscaling but I am more in favor of affordable pure (computation/rendering/storage) capacity.  To be honest neither Strix Halo nor very expensive IPL/B390 devices do not appeal to me.

AMD,Surely who have no idea what's FSR and DLSS  (loads of people),Negative
AMD,"Well DLSS4/4.5 running on older GPU's makes sense in that there's no real work that needs to be done for it.  You just run it on FP16 instead of FP8.  It's slower, but it ultimately works the same way.    Though it's still bizarre because it does seem AMD has \*already done\* the work to get FSR4 working on FSR3, even it might have been more effort to do so.    I can also see that maybe FSR4 on an architecture with a bigger performance penalty might not make as much sense in a mobile device where you really need upscaling to be efficient to be worth it.",Neutral

AMD,"Those are Strix Halo competitors. Intel is not using small Nvidia GPUs here but yeah   (Small and medium = Intel, high end = Nvidia is what it seems and it will be a winning strategy, AMD will be the worst option in laptops soon)",Neutral
AMD,"Nothing “inherent”, but perhaps not worth the effort.  RDNA4 adds more transistors over RDNA3 and improves RT performance in an “area inefficient” method. (Second intersection engine) Out of order memory returns also is RT centric feature.  So on a product where you don’t care about RT, rdna4 gives little benefit for its increased transistor usage, but it did still improve raster somewhat.  Whereas RDNA3.5 vs 3 focussed exclusivity on mobile perf/watt features given that it’s not available on desktop.  Don’t think of RDNA3.5 as a sort of “half measure” between RDNA3 and 4.  It’s more of an independent evolution over 3 adding mobile centric perf/watt features and dropping the features that improve “scalability” for large configs.   There is also the market, where despite all of us wanting to see these “large iGPU” products, most of the mobile stuff really doesn’t care.  Krackan (8core 4WGP) vastly outsells Strix (12C 8WGP).  And the largest RDNA4 on mobile would be 8WGP again due to memory BW. (half configuration of 9060XT)   Intels iGPU is VERY impressive given how lacklustre their desktop iGPUs were.

So far whether it's RDNA3, 3.5 or 4 as well as new Zen architectures *and* manufacturing nodes, progress in this regard has been very slow.  Unless something changes about target price or power envelope of the Deck, I don't see it having any possibility of releasing in immediate future.",Negative

AMD,"Mixture of that, software dev and do we have a definition of 'premium APU'? 3.5 is perfectly adequate for low end laptops and CPU iGPUs that exist as a fallback for when there's not a dGPU around, why add potential validation headaches?  Edit: Anything more then a 3.5 in my 13850X3D that I buy when it's EOL/used a few years down the line is a waste of time IMO because it's just adding extra validation work and thus waiting for me before it's launched and EOL/used when it's going to be running with a decent DGPU",Neutral
AMD,"I still remember AMD’s marketing from a few years back, dragging Intel for “forcing you to choose between cpu and integrated graphics” but not giving you both at the same time.

AMD,"Just because AMD will still be selling chips with old architecture doesn't mean they'll keep supporting them software wise unfortunately, like they were still selling the Zen3+Vega APUs as part of the ""Ryzen 7000 series"" when they kicked Vega support out of their latest drivers.

AMD,"AMD has never had the market share Intel had. They're *just now* getting to the share that Intel established in the early 2010s.   Intel held that market share for nearly a decade.

AMD,"> If Intel were at the top of their game, AMD would be giving you the newest rdna  Pretty sure that's not the problem. The problem is RDNA4 was designed (physically) as a single die layout. They have a 64cu die, which looks like an hourglass, and 32cu die, which is 1/2 of the hourglass. It's clear that from the start it was a stop-gap design for the desktop market.   They've said it's also the end of ""RDNA,"" and the next uArch will be UDNA, a ""merger of CDNA and RDNA.""   So they didn't design RDNA4 to be modular beyond 64/32cu designs. They intended UDNA to be the follow up, and I previous wagered that since it's a ground-up uArch (like RDNA was to GCN), they're building it from the ground up to be used in any applications.   The issue is UDNA is taking longer to cook. Is that intentional? Who knows. It could be that they pulled resources to push Instinct Compute development, could be that they're having Development Hell problems, could be anything. I don't doubt AI market bullshit is to blame.   But either way, UDNA wasn't likely to be in this years APUs either way, even if UDNA dGPUs were to release.",Neutral

They *really* need to get their engineering & finances together to make it work if they actually want to grow.  >Intels iGPU is VERY impressive given how lacklustre their desktop iGPUs were. But I guess that’s expected when you’re using TSMC N3.  Battlemage (and soon, Celestial) launched a lot of technologies (that are, as far as I know, new and unique to Intel) and implementations (of things other vendors have had for a while). It really did put them much closer to parity--and they never had the memory bandwidth limits RDNA seems to have anyway. They really could have put in a larger GPU in if they wanted to--it seems like they will--and AMD is now announcing they won't be changing anything. TBH, I don't know what exactly possessed AMD to announce they are going to let Intel rest and recover during their nadir for the next 3 years. Only developing 1 or 2 actual iGPU's and leaving them up for the $1600+ market segment just means almost everything below that will be using Intel instead. Like... there's no imagined configuration where a dGPU model that fits in below that price would be CPU bottlenecked enough to justify reaching for the RDNA 3.5 parts, *and* using Intel means they get a better iGPU & more profit anyway.  Unless the margins on their RDNA 3.5 parts are razor thin (and TBH judging by Minisforum's PC's that's not the case!), there's just no world where they're going to be gaining market share.",Neutral

Not to mention that the Steam Frame is using a Qualcomm chip so they're already split on working with both the AMD and Qualcomm drivers, adding Intel into the mix would probably just cause more of a headache.  Although it's not like Valve is opposed to doing things that wouldn't directly benefit their own devices, like the guy leading the work on getting the GCN 1.0/1.1 GPUs (as in the Radeon HD 7000 series plus the Radeon R9 200 series plus rebrands) to move to the latest Linux driver and enabling Vulkan out of the box (rather than using the same old driver as the TeraScale stuff) is from Valve (https://indico.freedesktop.org/event/10/contributions/429/attachments/246/332/xdc2025_old_gpus.pdf) so if Intel's GPUs gain enough momentum they may very well decide it's worth investing into.",Neutral

It was halted in 2024 during a memory bust, and resurrected to be delivered in 2028 100% due to the desire to catch up to the AI datacenter demand.  - SK Hynix fab cluster. $90 billion USD of memory fab capacity in 2027 and 2028 phases.  - The Micron $100 Billion megafab coming live in 2030, but the smaller $15 billion Idaho fabs are coming live this and next year.  - The CXMT massive Shanghai HBM fabs coming live later this year, and their $42 billion DRAM expansion is underway. They also aim to aggressively take over 15% of the global DRAM market by next year while the big three are leaving a gap in to prioritize data center.  Everyone is saying ""the biggest risk for the market is that we overshoot"" signaling to others to stop building, but they themselves are building because what they're scared of is missing on supplying a massive demand at historically high profit margins.  The global DRAM bit demand growth is currently hovering in the 20-25% range (per Micron and IDC), despite the dramatic headlines.

It puts Intel's fabs 2+ years behind.  18AP is likely to improve to get to maybe the best of N3, but 18AP was supposed to originally compete with N2 and that isn't going to happen.  Now the hope is that 14A competes with N2, but N2 is coming this year and 14A isn't coming until early 2028.  That keeps Intel at nearly 2y behind TSMC, despite their plans to regain node leadership.  It's good that 18A is now a process that's 'ok', but I'm sure Intel hoped for more and so did the market.  14A may be more exciting and rumours are that progress is smooth, performance is pretty good, clients are taking a serious look and so on but still, ideally it'd be launching this year or early 2027.",Negative

AMD,"ST perf has basically been flat for a while now, and even Apple's tablet chips are like 50% ahead. nT perf is in the same ballpark of Strix/Gorgon Point, despite being on a node that's ostensibly 1-2 full gens better. And the cores themselves are basically just minor tweaks of the ARL cores.  So if you basically took the same cores on the same node and made an ARL compute die out of it, it would barely budge the needle, if at all.

Intel is an entire 2 nodes ahead. and achieving . . . performance wise the user experience from an AMD HX 370, a 288V, and a 388H are going to be identical . . . You will need to get your stop watch out to be able to tell a difference. And Being that they are at similar power levels, it means Intels 388H is matching the power efficiency of AMDs 4nm HX370 under load . . . that is . . . not . . . great . . . so the CPU portion of the chip is . . . lackluster.  the IGPU is great though. that thing is a beast and if intel builds future products with better GPUs like that one? They could have something special.  AMD's medusa point comes later this year on TSMCs N2. this is going to have to hold its ground against that when it hits sometime later this year. So . . . we will see . . . AMD is moving to a new INFO packaging technology. They are going skipping from 4nm to 2nm. and they have a big architectural upgrade happening. Any one of those things would probably be good enough to place AMD measurably ahead of intel on the CPU front.  Intel may still have battery life performance over zen6 though.

AMD,"> The CPU is essentially rebranded LNC and SKT on 18A  They're derivatives, but typically that means a few percent IPC, and some significant focus on power reduction and clock speed improvement. Also, they changed the core config (4+12 better for MT than 6+8) and the SoC is way better. So if anything, I think this is a very bad look for 18A.

AMD,"> Their products will remain competetive, even if they are stuck on N3 equivalent node.  Let me illustrate. A full node gap is something like 10-15% perf. In other words, similar to the advantage X3D gives in gaming, but in almost every workload instead of just a subset. By adding something like 60mm^(2) of 7nm silicon, AMD's able to bump the retail price by ~$100. That's fantastic ROI. And then on top of that you have the exceptional marketing value of the halo effect.  Intel's looking at the same fundamentals. N2 is expensive, but the silicon cost is dwarfed by the premium it gets you in the market. So the only thing that would allow them to stomach an N-1 node is if they had some other advantage(s) that would still let them maintain clear leadership *despite* the node. Right now, they don't have anything.   > Isnt intel once again experimenting with larger caches?  Yes, and bLLC *could* even have an edge vs AMD's V-cache.

A few years ago I bought the prior year's Samsung S80 TV for half off by getting a floor model. No new TV could match the price to performance of the deal I got...but the deal I got is not scalable to the wider consumer market.

Perf wasn't affected by the memory latency, but if we're talking about SoC power (vs core power), then LNL made significant strides in power budget available to compute. That's one of the biggest factors at lower TDPs (and light loads), actually, because SoC power doesn't scale down as well.   > 5% performance improvement in 1T could be explained by the new SoC/updated core. The subsequent 10% power reduction has to be process node  Could you link the data you're using to compare here? Because +5% perf *or* -10% power iso-process would be very consistent with a tick, even modest by historical standards. For reference, their past ticks were WLC (SNC tick), RPC, and RWC (both GLC ticks). Obviously, very difficult to tease out the process contributions, but you'd think after fairly big reworks with both LNC and SKT, they'd have some room for refinement.

Built and booted first time without issue and cost me not much over a third what I would pay now for it in this economy.",Positive
AMD,"for 9800x3d you will need a new motherboard and ddr5 ram which at the moment is vary expensive so it is hard to recommend.   Buying used 5800x3d is not a bad idea if you can get it for fairly cheap. The are the parts that are among the hardest to destroy, so if you can get it from a ""trusted"" seller, you are good to go.  You said that it is similar price to 9800x3d... for 5800x3d I wouldnt pay more than 250$.   Good alternative is 5700x3d which is a bit slower than 5800x3d but are selling for quite cheaper. Both 5800x3d and 5700x3d are the best gaming cpus you can get without changing board or ram.       The third option is 5700x. It is an amazing value cpu since they are selling for around 90-130$. It is quite a bit slower than both 5700x3d and 5800x3d chips but it is miles ahead of what you currently have.       Any of these three options would be a good choice for reducing or eliminating the bottleneck you are seeing in some games...",Neutral
AMD,Make sure you update bios before switching as old boards might not work with new cpus using old bios.,Neutral
AMD,"Went from 5600x to 5700X3D last year, good upgrade for gaming. Anything from 3-5 series is better than your old CPU and is a good upgrade. Make sure your mobo can support it via bios update before switching.",Positive

You could get an R5 for similar performance for a bit cheaper, but if it were me I would look to a full 8-core (single CCD) Zen3 which will basically max-out your AM4 system (until your next full-build) for an average consumer/productivity on a budget.",Positive

I found a 5800XT for about 200 quid which is within my budget so I'll probably just pull the trigger on that then. Cheers.",Neutral

AMD,"Moving to 4K will put more load on the GPU, but will also result in lower frames per second.  Did you use something to determine that your 2700x is indeed holding you back?  (Do NOT rely on internet bottleneck calculators).  Did you use HWMonitor or AMD Adrenaline to determine that CPU was at full utilization during gaming?  According to [PCPartPicker.com](http://PCPartPicker.com), the 5600XT is available for $155 and the 5800XT is available for $200.  Single thread performance of the 5600XT is only 2-3% less than 5800XT.  Not enough to justify the $45 price increase for gaming.  If you were using Davinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere, or Blender, it would be worth it.  Then again, only you can decide how much it is worth it to you.  (A 5700G is in the middle price-wise, but is actually worse for gaming than either, since it sacrifices half it's cache to include the iGPU.)",Neutral
AMD,I went from 2700 to 5700x and it is a very noticeable upgrade. In hindsight absolutely kicking myself for not spending the 100 extra for the x3d but it is still holding up fine.,Positive
AMD,"Go get 5700x, its should be work just fine.  On average 1080p, it has 10-20% performance loss compared to its x3d counter part.  On higher resolution, the gap become closer.",Neutral
AMD,"I run OBS from time to time to record sometimes but thats about it. My budget is anything under £300, but obviously better value is better value. The games I play have ingame graphs showing various usage and my CPU sometimes spikes to triple digit numbers which has more or less confirmed to me its the CPU (ive also had the System Monitor open and it goes to the moon).  I have seen sources say that moving to a higher graphic output lile 4k or even 1440p would lessen the load by shifting it to my gpu but even then i feel like its probably worth it to upgrade the cpu anyway before they go the way of RAM (even more than they are).",Neutral
AMD,"Lessen the load, yes, but then the GPU becomes the bottleneck and you get lower framerates.  The reason the CPU utilization is lower is because you are generating fewer frames because the GPU can't output the same number of 4K frames/sec as 1080p frames/sec.  I mean if you have 100% CPU utilization and 15% GPU utilization, maybe you might still see the same number of frames., but if you have 100% CPU utilization and 50% GPU utilization, switch from 1080p to 4K results in 4x the work for the GPU.  While most people don't recommend bottleneck calculators, they can can show you RELATIVE performance.  While I wouldn't necessarily trust the actual frame rates and bottleneck percentages, they do show you want kind of shift you might experience going to a higher resolution.  The table below assumes a Ryzen 7 2700 and RX 6800 16GB playing Cyberpunk 2077 at medium settings.  As you can see, CPU becomes less of an issue, but FPS goes down as the GPU workload increases due to increased resolution.  |Resolution|Avg FPS|Min|Max|Playability|In-game Bottleneck| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1920 × 1080|**63**|54|72|Good|CPU Bottleneck (47%)| |2560 × 1440|**57**|49|66|Okay|CPU Bottleneck (36%)| |3840 × 2160|**43**|37|50|Average|CPU Bottleneck (16%)|",Neutral
AMD,5070 one is the no brainer.   extra storage is very easy to add later and the CPU can be upgraded to anything on the AM5 platform. The 14700f is more or less the best of the best for that socket. Give me expansion and upgradability any day.,Positive

AMD,"5070 is the best, although I think it went up a bit on Price closer to 600€... Check 5060TI 16GB, should be below 500€ still or even the 9070.",Positive
AMD,it would probably handle it at 100% load with a 650w. he's already pulling 460w and to have headroom he would need up to 690w. I have my 5070 OC along with my cpu OC and had a 850w PSU that would BSOD while gaming. I now have a 1000w PSU that has no issues but could have gone with an A-tier psu and possibly be fine but I wanted to make sure. just with the spikes from my CPU and GPU were hitting 500w combined. I wouldn't recommend a 650w with a 5070 unless you are not going to do any OC at all.,Neutral
AMD,You only get the newer tech of fsr4 or dlss4.5 and better RT out of both cards. You won't get much more fps in 1440p,Neutral
AMD,is the upgrade worth it?,Neutral
AMD,"So the spikes from your cpu and gpu were hitting 500w... sounds like a lot less than 650w. Your bsod could've simply been a bad psu, or maybe just a bad connection. Either that or you've got the most power hungry 5070 on the market and are cramming as much power into your cpu as possible. Like I said. 7800x3d + a manually oc'd 5080 on a 9 year old 750w psu never skipped a beat once (not entirely true, the newest nvidia drivers DID crash my pc once or twice until I stepped down the driver version).",Negative

AMD,CPU was spiking to 220w and the 5070 was spike at 270 with a c tier 850w atx3.0 psu. This was using Msi afterburner while gaming. Plus I have 10 case fans. My whole build comes out to about 600w on partpicker. If you take that and multiply by 1.5 (headroom) that comes out to 900w to soak up for spikes and since my OC are set high but within reason I opted for a 1000w because it was an A tier psu that was the same price as many 750 or 850 psu,Neutral
AMD,should i just wait for a sale on the 5070?,Neutral
AMD,"Just because a psu is only rated for 650w doesnt mean that's all it can handle. Thats just what it can handle sustained. Psu's are able to handle spikes multiple times their rated wattage, however the amount of headroom depends on quality of psu.",Neutral

AMD,"When I overclock my RX 6650 XT too far it crashes with a green screen.  It sounds like an OC profile configuration error like perhaps you saved an aggressive overclock through AMD Arenalin.  First thing I would try is a 100Mhz underclock on the GPU and see if it happens.  If you aren't getting the speed promised by an RX 7600 then I would consider an RMA.  The green screen is a very big tell that its an overclock crash, in my opinion.  Anyone with an AMD thats stress tested it in Heaven could tell you that.  Also Heaven is a good benchmark to run in a loop and play with the GPU frequency sliders to check for stability and artifacts.  Mine typically makes zero artifacts and just crashes.  It can't even tolerate even a mild overclock like 2703 core -> 2725 core is about the best it can do.  Mine has 2300mhz ram chips (Its an RX 6650 XT so very similar) so I actually run mine at 2499core/2300 ram and I get like 95% of the performance for 75% of the power.  So it typically draws like 125watts in that configuration and I'm happy with that.  My default never crashes though (2703Mhz), I would be suspicious and potentially RMA the card if that were the case.  You can \*maybe\* try reseating the GPU as maybe it has power delivery issues through the slot or cable.  I'm 100% certain though that green screen crashes are AMD GPU errors, like what you would see from too aggressive of an overclock.  The good thing is its definitely fixable with an underclock.  The bad thing is you might need to RMA the card if its not stable at defaults.",Negative

AMD,"The only way to know is to do whatever it is you're going to do on the PC and look at the ram usage.  If you get 32gb and your games/work + any open software and stuff never get past 15gb, then the extra 16gb stick is literally doing nothing and was a waste of money.  (keep in mind browsers allocate more ram than they use, so don't count those as they allocate it, but give it up when something else requests it, and they put hold on tabs that are not in focus releasing that from ram if idle long enough, etc..).  Just assume ""browser"" is going to use like 5gb MAX unless you have open browsers on like 3 displays all playing videos and HTML5/js games at the same time.   I doubt minecraft or sims 4 needs more than 16, and probably leaves plenty of headroom to do other things at the same time within reason.   Buy a 16gb kit, install it, play your games and look at ram usage, if you're maxing it out or identify a bottleneck, return it (so buy somewhere u can return), and get 32gb kit.",Negative

AMD,"5600X vs 5800XT, the later is going to be maybe 2% faster. The 5700X is going to split the difference between them.

AMD,There is no reason to buy the X CPUs anymore.  They are pretty expensive compared to the XTs that just just came out.  The XTs are better anyway because they have a slightly higher boost clock.,Negative
AMD,I've found a few RM750x for under $100USD and would upgrade to that before getting a new GPU & CPU from outside the set budget,Neutral
AMD,"Fully depends on your local prices, if you can grab the XT for a similar price, why not, but for gaming these CPU's are within margins of each other, other than the 5700x3d.",Neutral
AMD,I don't know much about usd pricing or anything but for most games a 5700x will be good enough maybe a 5800x and I think you'd at least want a 7700xt or 9060xt but if you can push it to something slightly better I would,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, if you are buying locally that could change things.  I assume most people will be buying online and online prices tend to be higher for the X than the XT.  Yeah, I'm glad a snagged a 5800X3D when I did.  Aside from the X3D stuff anything from a 5600 and up performs really close in games.",Neutral
AMD,From my understanding you are definitely on the right track.,Positive
AMD,"Oh yeah for sure, the 9060xt 16gb is a great card that offers a ton of new features along with a nice jump in performance and pretty good drivers.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah 9060xt (the more vram the better though) would be a great starting point. If you can find one used or at a good discount, I’d recommend the next tier up and go with the 9070xt. Nothing wrong with the 9060xt though, it’ll still kill at 1080p and keep up well at 1440p.  Unless you want to jump to AM5, just upgrade to a 5600 series cpu or something like that that’ll fit your budget",Positive
AMD,"9060 XT 16GB and 5060 Ti 16GB (if you can find it below 500) are both decent upgrades if you want to go for it, roughly 70 or 80% faster respectively. Also the FSR4 upscaling is quite a bit better, so you can draw a bit more extra performance there, or if you were already using FSR3 then the quality of FSR4 is a noticeable improvement.",Positive
AMD,"9060XT, but make sure it's the 16Gb version. Great card for the price, though it doesn't look like it's $350 these days.",Positive
AMD,I upgraded to a used 6700xt and love it. Sell your 5700 and you’re already half way there price wise,Positive
AMD,9060XT 16gb brand new is around $400 so they’re not too bad. If they can snag a used 9070XT for $500 that would be perfect,Positive
AMD,"A 750w PSU is the recommended minimum for a 9070 xt. OP only has a 550w PSU, so they should stick to the 9060 xt.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm thinking I need to upgrade my CPU as well, it's a Ryzen 5 3600. Do you have a good recommendation for a sub-$120 cpu upgrade, specifically with gaming in mind?",Neutral
AMD,I just bought a steel legend 9060 XT 16gb last week for $400 brand new on Newegg,Positive
AMD,Correct. I only suggested it because they had been considering a PSU upgrade. The 9060xt is the winner for sure if they stick with their plan to keep the current psu.,Positive
AMD,"Not sure if any are under $120, but your options to consider are 5600/5600X/5600XT/5700X/5800X/5800XT. There are some cheaper 5000 series models (5500, 5700, 5600G, etc), but all are of a different design that make them not really any better than a 3600.  You also probably need to update your motherboard BIOS before installing any of those 5000 series CPUs.",Neutral
AMD,"My suggestion would be to get the new GPU and crank up the eye candy and enjoy that for a couple years to save up for a big CPU/MB/RAM upgrade. Where you will maybe dial down some of the eye candy for fps.  A perfectly balanced system is over-rated. Alternate, which way the system is unbalanced over time.",Neutral
AMD,"just get a 5700X, DDR5 is way too expensive to recommended an AM5 upgrade",Negative
AMD,If you can find a used 5600x that’s a great cpu for that GPU,Positive
AMD,"I got mine a few weeks back already, but found an open box Hellhound for $285 at MC.",Neutral
AMD,Would the Ryzen 5 3600 not be seriously bottlenecking the 9060?,Neutral
AMD,Sadly I don’t have a microcenter near me so my only option is Newegg unless I wanna pay Best Buy’s outrageous prices,Negative
AMD,"Hard to say. Your monitor might be the bottleneck. 4K/60fps the CPU will not be the bottleneck. 1080P/240fps the CPU is a bottleneck, but by bottleneck that is maybe 120fps which is still pretty good, and you can max out the eye candy. At 1440P, it is probably pretty close to balanced.  Then, in a couple of years, you get a Zen 6 X3D and keep your 9060XT, and your 9060XT is the bottleneck. But, you are maxing out it's frame rate. Enjoy that for a couple of years, then buy a 11060XT and flip the bottleneck again, maybe, it might take a couple generations to max out a Zen 6 X3D without a flagship GPU.  I like avoiding the full upgrade CPU/MB/RAM/GPU. So, I want unbalanced, so when I upgrade the GPU, I get an improvement, and then a couple uears later, I upgrade the CPU and get an improvement. If my system is balanced, I can't upgrade just one or the other and get a benefit.  Is it worth keeping an eye out for a really good deal on a 5700X3D or other AM4 5000 series X3D CPU? Yes. Is it prerequisite to getting a 9060XT (or even 9070XT) and seeing a difference you can enjoy? No.  And, per my hint above, a monitor upgrade to go with the GPU, might be a better quality of life upgrade than a CPU. I don't know how good your monitor is.",Neutral
AMD,It's [this one](https://www.amazon.com/AOC-CQ27G1-DisplayPort-adjustable-Zero-Bright/dp/B07V39QHMY) if it helps,Positive
AMD,"My guess after skimming some benchmarks, with eye candy cranked, a 9060XT will still be the bottleneck at 1440p. Dialing down some settings, I would guess a 3600 may not get to 144fps in every game, but will probably exceed 100fps pretty consistently.  Like I said, I would do the GPU upgrade and just keep an eye out for a good deal on an AM4 X3D CPU. If you find one great, if you don't, I think you will still be happy.",Neutral
AMD,Title is the wrong way around 😔  I was really worried that you were going in the wrong direction there for a second (jk),Negative
AMD,That's fine,Positive
AMD,You messed up your title. I thought you were devolving,Negative
AMD,"You messed up the title.   I think most modern Prime boards are kinda crap. The B850's VRMs got really hot in Hardware Unboxed review: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFqd7lnXlIk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFqd7lnXlIk)  You're overlooking that the RAM price can stay stupidly expensive for more than month or two, but noone really knows.",Negative
AMD,"If you have access to a microcenter, just get whatever 9850x3d bundle they have, maybe pay for the upgraded motherboard if it's nicer.",Neutral
AMD,What are you worried about overlooking? AMD does the job perfectly fine and will save you money.,Positive
AMD,Yeah I read through the whole post then changed the title and what’d ya know that one thing I didn’t check was the mistake 😂. I’ve been wanting to switch to AMD for a while. Just seems to be the best idea for gaming in my opinion.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah thanks I just noticed. Yeah. I might just go with the AORUS Elite then. I know that RAM prices will stay mostly the same but can always hope, I don’t need to upgrade right now anyways so I figure just waiting a bit wouldn’t hurt.",Positive
AMD,"Sadly I’m based in the UK and we don’t have a MicroCenter, wish there was.",Negative
AMD,"Making sure I wouldn’t make a mistake I’d regret, like someone else mentioned I probably wouldn’t want to get a Prime board. Good to hear the parts make sense at least. Thanks.",Neutral
AMD,"Understandable. It’s always the most obvious bits that are overlooked.   Unfortunately, I can’t really contribute in any meaningful way to the discussion. Anecdotally however I switched to AMD in 2024 and have never been happier with my rig. All the best with your new build :)",Negative
AMD,"Yeah I haven’t really heard any bad things from people switching to AMD. Thanks for your anecdote nonetheless, still helped.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm biased towards air cooling; I'd stick with the NH-D15.  When you're using the PC, you're not generally gawking at it's internals",Neutral
AMD,"nh d15 is so fucking overpriced for no good reason, a peerless assasian is around 4-5x cheaper and is barely worse. anyone who tells you to buy one is a D1 shill, idiotic or stuck in the past and shouldnt be giving advice   https://gamersnexus.net/megacharts/cpu-coolers#200W-normalized-100",Negative
AMD,"D15 is just wasting money, only buy it if you're a die hard Noctua Fanboy/girl.  Thermalright Peerless Assassin / Phantom Spirit offer similar cooling performance for a fraction of the price.",Negative
AMD,"I am using a Noctua NH-U12A with a 9800x3d.  Good ram clearance, cool, quiet.  No regrets, I would recommend this over an AIO for reliability and maintenance.",Positive
AMD,Noctua has never done me wrong,Positive
AMD,Phantom Spirit 120 and call it a day. Noctua if you care about looks/silence,Neutral
AMD,">NH-D15  You can spend 1/4th up to 1/2 of the money of a Noctua cooler by getting something like a Thermalright Peerless Assassin/Phantom Spirit... or Frost Commander 140. Total height matters, you'll have to check the specs on the case on max height.    >However, I won't have clearance for my RAM  Most coolers have cutouts for taller RAM, and you can always reposition the front fan a little higher to accommodate.",Neutral
AMD,"oh, i thought you had a D15 already, didnt realise you're weighing up options.  What are you using now, and have you considered undervolting?  Even setting the proc on eco mode will bring down temps significantly.",Neutral
AMD,Scythe Fuma 3 is a decent air cooler that lets you see your RGB RAM  If you don't care about seeing your RAM then get a Thermalright Phantom Spirit,Positive
AMD,Depends on price of said aio. Noctua air coolers are insanely overpriced. Peerless assassin 120 is same performance but only 30 bucks,Negative
AMD,"Go with the aio, air coolers are loud and an eyesore.",Negative
AMD,Prepare to be downvoted by people who justify 100$ for 2015 technology,Negative
AMD,Do you know what kind of temps you get with it?,Neutral
AMD,https://gamersnexus.net/megacharts/cpu-coolers#200W-normalized-100  noctua is barely better in noise normalised test. fucking embarassing for how much they charge,Negative
AMD,The AIO I’ve seen are cheaper than the Noctua,Neutral
AMD,I'm away for a few days before I could get any more data points.  Playing BF6 it runs at 63C at indicated 32% cpu utilization from the steam overlay.  I don't think I have seen it over 70C but would need to benchmark it again.,Neutral
AMD,"If aesthetics are important, go aio. Never buy noctua. The 30 dolla versions perform the same",Negative
AMD,"If you’re going to stay on AM4 I’d save up for a 5600, you don’t need a new motherboard.",Neutral
AMD,Do not buy a new AM4 motherboard. That defeats the whole purpose.,Negative
AMD,Don't buy a new motherboard or ram if you're gonna get a 3600 or 5600x     What motherboard exactly do you have?,Neutral
AMD,"Don't spend money on mother and ram, put that money into the CPU, don't forget to update the bios.  Changing the motherboard is not going to give you any improvement, and going from 2400mhz to 3200mhz does not give a significant performance change, what will do is the cpu, 5600, 5500x3d or 5700x  Add a 1TB HDD to relieve the SSD, so you can put your files and install programs and light games, so that the SSD is left for heavy games.",Neutral
AMD,"The difference between a 1700X and a 3600, in games, is pretty significant. I'd just get the 3600 first; you have enough RAM (though it is a little slow) and your motherboard is perfectly fine. Upgrade the RAM later, if you need more capacity or if you find a real good deal on DDR4-3200/3600 stuff.",Positive
AMD,"If you can get a 3600, or really any 3/5000 chip that isn't an APU or cut APU, for reasonable money I'd say do it.   The ""good"" part of AM4 is being able to do that; buying another AM4 motherboard would be a bit silly, and the only benefit you'd really have from a motherboard upgrade would be to add a second M.2 and/or gain PCIe Gen 4, but neither of those make meaningful impacts on a 3060.   I'd also look at the 3700X if available for a modest cost difference vs the 3600, just because it lets you keep your core count and guarantees a system that's better everywhere than current, rather than better-or-the-same as a 3600 would be.",Neutral
AMD,I'd be going 5600 at a minimum,Neutral
AMD,I did buy a 3600X for my 1700 replacement just to make it work with Windows 11.,Neutral
AMD,You can find 5800x 8 core for 140€$ ... Don't buy 6 core CPU,Neutral
AMD,"I'd really try to aim for a 5600, but if not, a 3600/5500 would be a solid upgrade.",Positive
AMD,"As someone with a current R5 3600 I would buy something newer, and prioritize an AM5 platform.  Im trying to hold out one more year for an upgrade, we will see if that comes to fruition.  Its starting to show some signs of aging.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, it is a great processor. Try to find one on Facebook Marketplace or AliExpress for a good deal if you can. Are you sure you also need to upgrade your MoBo?",Positive
AMD,Probably get a 5600 and keep your current motherboard and ram   Yes Ryzen is memory sensitive and will be faster with faster ram. But the uplift from 3000 series to 5000 is larger than that ram upgrade and probably cheaper just update your bios,Positive
AMD,The 5600x shouldn't be much more expensive and definitely worth it.,Positive
AMD,"at least get one of those if you are gonna upgrade 5600,5600x,5700x,5800x,5800xt those are better than 3600 and are a diminishing return in the am4 platform you could get the 5800x3d thou but the price is expensive for them so just get one of the cpus i listed below",Neutral
AMD,"Cause everybody is going after 5000 series, the 3600 is really affordable.  It's an upgrade so go for it.  I wouldn't bother upgrading your motherboard, put the money towards a better CPU and/or the 3200 memory.",Positive
AMD,A brand new 5600 non-X is like $170. Probably around $100 on the used market. Would be a massive upgrade to your 1700X even without any other upgrades. Although getting a kit of RAM in the 3200 or 3600 speed would also help with performance some. (EDIT: but not a HUGE deal if you dont upgrade your ram)  Your motherboard would just need a bios update and you can plop that sucker in. You'd have to check your motherboards support page tho - as some early boards remove support for 1st gen Ryzen CPUs after a bios update to support newer CPUs. But IDK which chipset that was on.,Neutral
AMD,"There’s quite a bit of improvements from 3 series to 5, so try for 5600 if you can.   You can pretty much reuse everything you have just make sure to update your bios to a version that supports 5 series.  Most x370 and b350 boards should have them.",Positive
AMD,"Look used as well, but a 5600 would be better. The 3600 is not bad though. Both are definitely a good upgrade over first gen ryzen.",Positive
AMD,"Look used as well, but a 5600 would be better. The 3600 is not bad though. Both are definitely a good upgrade over first gen ryzen.",Positive
AMD,"with a coupon you can get a 5600x for 80 pounds on aliexpress, much faster than a 3600 which costs around 50 pounds on ebay",Positive
AMD,"In order I would get a 5600, then upgrade your ram to a faster speed, then upgrade your GPU. Those x370 boards are really nice and will be great for a new CPU.",Positive
AMD,"Get a 3600, or a 5600, plus a ram upgrade if you really want.   Do not buy a motherboard. Your motherboard will support either option with a bios update.",Neutral
AMD,"I had a 3600x, it started showing it's age. Playing games with discord on the background was starting to stutter.  Today I would not get a CPU worse than a 5600. Check 2nd hand market, the price difference might not be that big VS a 3600.",Negative
AMD,"I'd get the ryzen 5 7600x plus the peerless assassin heatsink   2nd hand cost is less than £200  I've just upgraded from that myself, and it had no issues playing Battlefield 6",Positive
AMD,Says right there X370 slr plus.,Neutral
AMD,Yeah agree with this comment just going to provide a list of the chips to avoid  These are the zen3 Apu chips.  https://www.techpowerup.com/cpu-specs/?f=codename_=Cezanne  The Ryzen 5 5500 this is a 5600g without the igpu in some games if loses to a 3600 due to low cache  The 5700 non X it's a 5700g without the igpu   Anything with a g or gt E.G 5600g 5600gt 5700g  These are the regular zen 3 chips and would all be pretty respectable upgrades  https://www.techpowerup.com/cpu-specs/?f=codename_=Vermeer,Neutral
AMD,not in my country. i just checked the 5600 is 145 in euro,Neutral
AMD,where to find this price? thank u,Neutral
AMD,6 core is plenty heck HUB just did a review of the 5600 and it holds up well in the majority of games. A few exceptions but the GPU will also limit performance.,Positive
AMD,"Not really, its still running strong. it was only as most of the cpus are part of the upgrade kit",Positive
AMD,how do i get a coupon,Neutral
AMD,"> 2nd hand cost is less than £200  Plus the cost of a motherboard and DDR5 RAM, compared to like $50 for a Ryzen 5 3600 though. It's better, but whether it's worth it is pretty subjective.",Neutral
AMD,The issue with that is you're making the jump to am5 and ddr5 which is definitely gonna cost more than a 5600x,Negative
AMD,If it's the MSI board then it supports all the at up to the 5800x3d on latest bios so no need to grab a 3600 when you can get anything from the 5000 gen,Neutral
AMD,aliexpress,Neutral
AMD,theres like a 15 pounds off above 99 voucher where i am from. should be on the love delivers event main page. or maybe you could use a welcome offer if you have one.,Neutral
AMD,DDR 5 ram is going to be an issue with the skyrocketing prices,Negative
AMD,Ok I had no idea.  I don’t suppose my Auros B450 in my second rig supports anything above my 2600.,Negative
AMD,You'd be good with a 5000-series CPU as long as you update your BIOS.,Positive
AMD,"Thanks, I realized I was being lazy and looked up the CPU support for it, curious why the 5000 x3d is not listed. I can look this up as well but thought it was strange.  Also, correction that I’m running a 3600 in this machine now, too many PCs in the family lol. I’m curious what others thoughts are on 3600 with my 5070 for 1080p gaming (240fps targets) and video editing. Would 3600-5000 be a significant uplift?",Neutral
AMD,"You'll need to check benchmarks for the games and programs you're interested in. If I remember correctly, there's roughly a 40% uplift from a 3600 to a 5600, but whether or not that's meaningful depends on what you're doing.",Neutral
AMD,"The best would be a 5x00x3d CPU hands down, but they're expensive. A 5700x for example is a good upgrade over the 5500 as it has 2 extra cores, a better architecture and more cache. Expect an uplift in performance of about 20-30%.   The ram should be matched for better performance but it is also very expensive.",Positive
AMD,"PCIe 3.0 doesn't make much of a difference, don't worry about that.   If they still have X3D chips at prices close to MSRP, those might be worth it. Otherwise get the 5800x or 5800XT.   Also, you'll want to upgrade that 4GB stick to another 16GB one to have 32GB of RAM.",Neutral
AMD,"Depends what is a reasonable price to you. What platform you choose depends on your expectations and budget. On am4 for gaming, I would only consider the 5600, or the 5700x3d if you can find one for a good price.",Neutral
AMD,"5700x.  Yeah the 16+4gb ram isn't ideal and will probably hold bad performance to an extent.  Motherboard might not be good enough to stably support the 5700x but PCIe 3.0 shouldn't a big problem as it is a x16 slot. (If you were getting a 5050, 5060, it 5060ti 8/16gb it would be a different stor6)",Negative
AMD,The only real bottleneck here is the ram Just run 16gb You can get a 5600 if you want to but the best for am4 is 5700/5800x3d I'd honestly just run 16gb and call it a day,Neutral
AMD,Bro. Don’t use mixed  RAM in a gaming pc,Negative
AMD,7600x3d combo from microcenter,Neutral
AMD,"5800x3d, 5800xt. Or grab a microcenter bundle of amd 9600x/9700x/7800x3d.",Neutral
AMD,"At 1440p with your RX 9070 XT, the GPU is still the main driver for performance, but your current Ryzen 5 5500 can start to bottleneck in CPU-heavy games, especially ones with high frame rates or simulation workloads. Moving up to a Ryzen 7 5700X or 5900X will give you more cores and threads, which is helpful for multitasking and modern gaming, but the difference at 1440p is not as dramatic as at 1080p, because the GPU is doing most of the work. The memory configuration you have (16+4 GB) is not ideal. Mismatched DIMMs can impact performance, particularly on AMD platforms where dual-channel operation is crucial. Even if you upgrade the CPU, that memory setup could hold you back slightly. Ideally, a matched 32 GB dual-channel kit would squeeze the most performance out of a 5900X or X3D CPU. As for the X3D chips, they excel in gaming due to the large L3 cache, but at 1440p and with your PCIe 3.0 board, the real-world benefit may be modest. They are expensive and hard to source, so unless you find a deal, the value proposition isn’t great compared to a standard 5900X or even a 5700X. Jumping to AM5 now would solve the memory limitation and future-proof you for PCIe 4.0/5.0 and DDR5, but it comes with significant cost due to new motherboard and RAM prices. If you’re price-sensitive and the goal is mainly to get a modest CPU improvement at 1440p, staying on AM4 with a 5700X or 5900X is reasonable. You’ll reduce bottlenecks for CPU-heavy titles and keep most of your investment intact. So in short: for 1440p gaming, upgrading to a 5700X or 5900X gives you a tangible benefit without the high costs of AM5/X3D. Don’t stress too much about PCIe 3.0 or DDR4; your GPU will still be the main factor for FPS. Reserve AM5 for when you’re ready for a full platform overhaul.",Neutral
AMD,"5800X, 5800 XT or 5900X, whichever you can get a good deal on. But 5700X would also be a good upgrade.  The AM4 X3D CPUs sell for ridiculously high prices and aren't worth it. At least last time I checked prices were craaaaaazy and supply limited.",Positive
AMD,"You can get a 5800x3d as x3d chips are good for gaming, if AM5 is too expensive due to RAN prices",Neutral
AMD,What's your budget,Neutral
AMD,Best one that you can actually buy for a reasonable price - 5800XT or 5700X.,Positive
AMD,"Was in similar dilemma as you last month before, bottleneck is too much and im playing 1440p .. ended up upgrading all, just happen finding a bundle deal for motherboard cpu and ram so went for that upsetting the ram crazy markup prices .

AMD,5800X,Neutral
AMD,5800x,Neutral
AMD,"If you are doing video editing and 3D, the extra cores for the 3900 would be worth it imo.",Positive
AMD,5800x if you're going more for gaming. 3900x if you're going more for the video editing and 3d design.,Neutral
AMD,"The question is why you need to upgrade. The 5800X is the better choice, but neither will give you earth shattering performance improvements except the 3900X and only where AVX2 isn't heavily relied on but many cores are needed. At least the 5800X won't be a downgrade in gaming.",Neutral
AMD,"Have you had troubles with your 5600X? A lot of people tend to assume that you need a lot of cores for productivity work, but realistically it rarely makes a big difference.  If you must upgrade, the 5800X is still the better choice. The only time the 3900X comes out on top is when you are utilizing all the cores which is very rare. For the rest of the time, the 5800X will be faster (although the 5600X should be nearly the same way).",Neutral
AMD,I would save more for a bigger upgrade. Both of these wouldn’t give too much of a performance increase,Neutral
AMD,"how much of your income does come from productive, professional 3d design and video editing ? Can you wait some additional seconds if your buildchain for your programming is not scaling over 12 but only 8 faster cores ?  Personal bet is, get the 5800x and call it a day",Neutral
AMD,5800x has~30% faster single core perf vs the 3900x. The 3900x has 50% more cores but they clock down a bit when running at full tilt.   Both are performance peers for mt but the 5800 is a bit ahead on ST.,Neutral
AMD,5800X has much faster single core performance and will still be reasonably close to 3900X in multicore. 5800X also has a much better AVX2 implementation where 3900X will show its age. 3900X will also be a significant downgrade from the 5600X in gaming.,Positive
AMD,"depending on the resolution you're already there with a 3070. A better GPU will give more fps, but not as much as you would get with a far superior CPU.  Basically 9850x3d + 3070 to 9850x3d+5070 would probably be a 55% improvement at 1440p, but with your CPU you maybe would only see like a 40% improvement going 3700x+3070 to 3700x+5070. Maybe less, maybe more, Depends on game and I doubt anyone could tell you exactly. Your 3700x just already is holding you back in some games unless maybe playing at 4K.  Edit: [https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-ryzen-5-7600x/19.html](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-ryzen-5-7600x/19.html) just to give a sense of how your CPU stacks up with just an RTX 3080, and the 7800/9800X3D CPUs aren't even on there.  I wouldn't go over an RTX 5070 or RX 9070, and a Ryzen 5600/5600x/5700x/5800x are probably worth looking into no matter what GPU. RTX 3080 is the weakest I'd consider, or 4070.",Neutral
AMD,"You would be better off upgrading the CPU first. the 3070 is already probably near the top if not the best GPU for what you have before you start bottlenecking from newer hardware. If you're on a budget, the 5600X is a good upgrade (5700X if you dont mind spending a bit more.",Neutral
AMD,">what GPU would be the best to use without running into bottleneck territory?  In what games? What resolution?  Some games can be bottlenecked by the GPU, some by the CPU, so it depends on the games you are trying to run at higher settings.",Neutral
AMD,"For a ryzen 7 3700X, you want GPUs that won’t hold it back too much. An RTX 3080 or a 6800 XT are good upgrades   They’ll boost your performance without stressing the CPU too much. If you wanna see some benchmarks and prices, gputiful’s a good site for checking out the best graphics cards at the moment.",Positive
AMD,"Thats assuming they want to build a whole new setup tho, which by what they said doesnt look like they are looking to do so.",Neutral
AMD,"Definitely not looking to upgrade into a 5000 series card unless I were buying an entire new system. I noticed the 4000 series cards are running less than I expected ($600ish...I haven't been keeping track lately) and that's what prompted it. The monitor is a Samsung curved 27"" 256mhz, running 1440 normally.",Negative
AMD,"Running some fairly graphic-heavy games at 1440 (256mhz 27"" curved Samsung monitor). Star Citizen, MSFS 2024 are probably the biggest hits and where the FPS drops going from medium to high settings are the most noticeable.  I brought the whole thing up because I noticed 4000-series cards are running $500-600 and wondered how much improvement we'd get. If I have to replace the GPU, I might just end up getting a whole new build and make this computer a backup or alternate. Seems like a waste when it still does so well in *most* games.",Neutral
AMD,"Excellent, thanks.",Positive
AMD,"Well ya. I'm just trying to explain that it's not like there's some magical limit for his CPU where a more powerful GPU won't give him more fps on average.  5800x3d/5700x3d would be a huge  improvement, they're just absurdly expensive because everyone is buying them since DDR5 ram costs way too much and many people had B450/B550 boards.  A 3700x is bottlenecking already and given GPUs are now over MSRP and we have no idea on the guys value of more fps, it's not easy to say what a good GPU is. Maybe an RTX 5070 or RX 9070 at best I suppose, still gonna be some big bottlenecking even at 1440p potentially.",Neutral
AMD,"I would rather not. If I have to change the CPU/mobo, I'm inclined to just built a whole new system :)",Neutral
AMD,"Also just saw this, if you're trying to run star citizen of all games, you need a new setup in general. Any upgrades to either side isnt gonna see a noticable improvement in any of those 2 games you mentioned cuz you're gonna be affected by lack of fps one way or the other",Negative
AMD,right so you just need to upgrade to the 5000 series. 5700X3d/5800X3D(if you have the money for it) Oh just saw your comment about the CPU. My point is that it makes more sense upgrading the CPU instead of the GPU in order to get more FPS. The 3070 is a fine card in itself for 1080p- medium 1440p  as long as you temper your expectations,Neutral
AMD,"Oh boy, here we go again.   There's a reason I out right refuse to recommend Asrock boards on AM5.",Negative
AMD,"I have an AsRock B650 board with my 7800x3D, no issues.   It's Zen 5 that's affected, Zen 4 is fine.",Neutral
AMD,Yeah my 9700x died from a B850 pro rs after a couple weeks.  I went back to a gigabyte board and have had no issues except for laughably weak m.2 screws.  Real.  Just look at those screws wrong and they snap in half.  I’m surprised the tension from the angle of the pcb hasn’t sheared it off sending it through my side panel… /s,Negative
AMD,"This is literally not news. A) its not a secret. B) Following the flood of 9800X3D reports, as one might suspect, others reported that more CPUs were effected. Its like if your car has a recall for a bad transmission, they find that the clutch was damaged.  Is the clutch torched because the trans, or did it just happen to fall in line with what would be normal failure rate.  The reason we don't see more bad clutches... I mean CPUs with other brands is because they are not being dug into, not to the degree that Asrock has been. The Mods over on r/ASRock have done a down right divine service tracking reports.  Now, while I like Asrock products, I will not pretend you should buy any 9000 series with any 800 series board, until fixes are concrete. But anyone pretending that they should be avoided until the end of time, is a fool because every brand has issues. ASrock isn't even the first to nuke X3D CPUs.",Negative
AMD,Also since 3.40 bios memory compability got worse. And you have to enable ln2 to boot system everytime otherwise ig T might not boot.   I am like very dissapointed. Still my 9800x3d is alive after over a year. So i cant compline much.,Negative
AMD,How new are these reports?,Neutral
AMD,Can someone on a asrock board confirm what auto expo voltage is for VSOC? I really highly doubt this is vsoc voltage related…,Negative
AMD,Is it only limited to ASRock motherboards or any brand overall? I'm kind of worried because I recently built a PC with a 9600X and an MSI B850-S motherboard.,Negative
AMD,Its not a X3D so its got to be a Zen 5 Issue.,Neutral
AMD,How do 7700x look in this regard? Was looking at a 9600x or 7800x3d but 7700x looks more appealing now,Neutral
AMD,I noticed that the AGESA 1.2.0.F is causing the issue for AM4 CPUs. I thought my Ryzen 7 5800X3D died because I am having my CPU debug led lit up in the motherboard. But when I downgraded my BIOS to 1.2.0.E it came back to life and never had the issue. There is something in the latest AGESA update that is causing the issue. Looks like it does not only affect AM5 but also AM4.,Negative
AMD,thank goodness i didn't buy asrock when building my AMD system last year. if this would have happened to my 7600X i would lose my mind.,Negative
AMD,many so many new org and people on reddit are experts in engineering and software for this subject.  oh wait they are not.,Neutral
AMD,this happened to me with the 9950x3D.,Neutral
AMD,I traded my 9800x3d to a dude I know for his 7800x3d and 100 bucks.,Neutral
AMD,ASRock went from one of the best brands to something you avoid. They need to fix this ASAP,Negative
AMD,Common. Denominator.,Neutral
AMD,Still AsCrap problem?  There should be a PSA not to use any Asrock AM5 boards for any reason.,Negative
AMD,"Have we had any such reports for 7000 series chips on ASRock boards?   Also Asus boards have started killing 9800x3ds too, I hear",Negative
AMD,Even if it's only am5 this will damage their reputation for years  I was going to get the ASRock nova board with my 9809x3d and then all the dead CPU reports come out ..I waited to see if it was fixed ... Then just went a different brand.  And now I'll never go ASRock in the future,Negative
AMD,"Same, had some issues with being able to boot computer  everytime I updated my 4090 but eventually fixed that and it’s been smooth sailing",Neutral
AMD,How goes the Gigabyte control center? for me it caused blue screen crashes.      Yes that brand and some ausus boards the screws are a joke i like the rare times you just get a screwless m.2 slot.,Negative
AMD,So 600 boards are fine?  I’m rocking a rig strix b650e-f and was going to upgrade from a 7600 to either a 7800x3D or a 9800x3D.,Neutral
AMD,">This is literally not news  In other subs one can still see random claims that the dead CPU issue was ""fixed"" through BIOS updates, it's therefore good that we are made aware (and reminded) how reality is. Even if just to help others make a sensible purchasing decision for their next motherboard.",Negative

AMD,"All of them have this problem: MSI, Gigabyte and Asus. Most likely it's an problem with CPU rather than a motherboard.",Negative
AMD,You can look at the mega thread on /r/AsRock   It's a Zen 5 issue. More 9700x and 9600x CPUs dead than 7800x3Ds or any other Zen 4 CPU. Mostly dead 9800x3D.,Negative
AMD,Biggest thing with Gigabyte Control Center is don’t let it install Norton.  Fuck that shit! Mine works fine for changing my rgb.  That’s all I use it for.  I’ve got a 9070xt red devil and fixed blue light speakers so I’m stuck with the Spider-Man color scheme until further notice (I’m not complaining).  I could plug in a cable to change the color of the gpu but why bother.  Blue ram and speakers and red case fans and gpu.,Negative
AMD,"A ROG board? Not asrock...   I mean, ironically with a 7000X3D CPU its a worse combo (asus was the other company that recently was nuking such CPUs when they launched). But, that's by and large old news. As the other comment noted, across the baord 9000X3D CPUs have a higher rate of failure. How high, we do not know, AMD is being tight lipped about that.  Personally, I am rocking a 7800x3d in a X870e Asrock mobo. As the failures of 7000 series seems to be ""normal"" ie of no special concern(and that asrock board had features that would have cost 1.5x to 2x easy with other brands). I am also plugging a 7600X3D into an Asus B650e-I mobo for another build.",Negative
AMD,Get the 7800x3d. The failure rate is pretty low on that one and is pretty stable. I would say avoid the 9800x3d for now as it seems like the combination of the cpu and motherboard is causing these failures.,Negative
AMD,I got an asrock taichi lite b650e with 7800x3d for 2 years. Absolutely zero problems with it. Amazing gaming performance.,Positive
AMD,"Not as bad as I suspected.    Still a problem, but nowhere close to enough to keep me off AM5 in the future.   Definitely avoid asrock AM5 boards though. It's not just the dying cpus, there are other issues I've seen as well.",Negative
AMD,"Nope. You can see from literally other subs their motherboard is just fine with zen 5 cpus, its just Asrock kept having this problem.  Tom's Hardware said its due to Asrock incompatible PBO config. I don't know to much about that but I'm hoping for the best for my Gigabyte b650",Neutral
AMD,I never messed with power color for awhile but you can check the sides of the pcb for a rgb switch some of those brands have them my asrock does. Or you can get tweezers look for the rgb cable you can get lucky and see it on the side of the card wiggle it out. Its all up to in the end just though i pass on some info.      I had rainbow puke ram could not get colors to set so glad before the crazy price hike i got new non rgb ram.,Neutral
AMD,I un-installed gigabyte control center and all my issues went away. I use signal rgb now.,Positive
AMD,I kept seeing Asus was in second place behind asrock and that ROG is still Asus but their “gamer” line or something like that.  Wasn’t sure if people just lumped rog in with Asus stats at that point.,Neutral
AMD,"There's a lot of bias in those numbers to be fair, we don't know the relative market share of each brand nor the total number of cpus out there.   While it does appear ASRock is more likely to be involved, it's still a tiny % and very hard to draw any solid conclusions.   A single retailer said they sold 8700 9800x3ds in a single day, back in Jan '25.   There are probably tens of thousands of ASRock AM5 systems out there by now.   Fwiw my B850 steel legend/9800x3d has been running great for over a year, but that said it's perfectly reasonable to want to use another brand.",Neutral
AMD,"Sorry, what I'm trying to say is that it's an AsRock issue specifically with Zen 5, Zen 4 it seems based on the number of cases is not affected.",Neutral
AMD,The gpu has a header for the rgb.  I just can’t be bothered after my last build bit the dust and I spent countless hours trying to diagnose the problem (asrock mobo and zen5) during my busy season at work.  I was working 10-12 hours a day 6 days a week at a tire shop here in Alaska.  Then spending my off time trying to get it to work.  My case can change the fan rgb with a button push (montech air 903 max).  I have 32gb cl30 Corsair vengeance and haven’t had problems setting the color.,Negative
AMD,"No.   There is a company that holds stock, or owns both Asus and ASRock(I forget). That's why people say they are the same brand nowadays.   ROG is just a ""model"" of ASUS. Like how RAM is Dodge. That's why it is Asus ROG -product-.",Neutral
AMD,It does appear to be a small percentage and mine has been running fine for about a year on an Asrock board. But had I known at the time of purchase I would've picked another brand.  I've tried to stay on top of the bios updates at least,Neutral
AMD,I did take this into account. It makes AM5 a much better platform than lga1700 in that way. This to say that I don't like intel bros claiming AM5 is more unstable than LGA 1851/1700.,Neutral
AMD,I had a old old drr4 kit still works just rgb puke can't complain.      Montech nice never new about the rgb button they got now.      All you had to say alaska tire shop the amount of tire changes would be exhausting on its own no doubt. Put on those hours fuck man hows the body?,Positive

AMD,Oh i did the customer side fixing pcs fucking hated talking to many.      You take care out there maybe i will see you on gold rush? :),Negative
AMD,This just shows what tests from other reviewers have also shown.   For gaming the extra Cache of AMDs X3D CPUs can almost completely negate the bottleneck that comes from slower memory.,Neutral
AMD,Dumb question because I don’t really know anything about PC’s: are there motherboards out there for AM5 that actually support DDR4? I thought you were essentially locked to DDR5 on AM5 mobos?,Neutral
AMD,"No, AM5 CPUs themselves inherently do not support DDR4.",Neutral
AMD,"I’m so stupid, I read DDR5-4800 as DDR4 lmao",Negative
AMD,I read it like that as well,Neutral
AMD,It's probably because before the RAMocalypse you never heard of DDR5-4800. It was always at least 5000-something MT/s.,Neutral
AMD,I’d stick with what you have,Neutral
AMD,The 5080 one would be 600 more for about 15 percent more performance so have to ask yourself if it's worth it.  And just noticed its not a X3D so would lose a little cpu performance in more CPU bound games.,Neutral
AMD,"stick with what you have.  though if you *do* end up getting a prebuilt, make sure to reinstall the OS.  Prebuilds come with a whole slew of bloatware installed.",Negative
AMD,Thanks! Do you see any issues with the glass case not having good heat circulation ?,Neutral

AMD,The vast majority of Americans don't live near a Microcenter so it's not something most people can take advantage of.  This is more a case of you being lucky that you get to travel.  Most Americans don't get any paid days off or vacation days.,Neutral

AMD,First of all almost the whole world uses a different currency when it comes to trading and guess what it's American dollars.  A gpu that's 1000 bucks isn't 1000bucks in the other parts of the world. More like 1200-1300.,Neutral
AMD,"tariffs are not state dependent.  I paid over $1,000 in tariffs last year alone.",Neutral
AMD,"What does this comment have to do with accessibility to goods?  You are off on a tangent about paying more that Microcenter when not even most Americans get those prices.  FYI a $1,000 GPU ain't $1,000 in the US anymore anyways thanks to tariffs and shortages.    You certainly have a privileged picture of the US being able to come here on a vacation that most Americans don't get to take advantage of the low prices and then just assume all Americans can do the same.  Must be nice.",Negative
AMD,Last year that makes sense.. I don't feel I'm feeling the tariffs near as bad if at all this year comparitevly.,Neutral
AMD,I have a privileged picture of the United States because I've been fortunate enough to travel to more countries than there are States in the USA.   It's not about the prices even but the abundance of choices you have even.,Positive
AMD,Most people don't because they aren't direct importers.  The effects will ripple down the chain and increases prices for customers.,Negative
AMD,"Point out to me the abundance of choice Americans have and I'll demonstrate to you how that's either not true, an illusion, or prohibitively expensive.  Let's start with price.  Upfront price in the US doesn't include tax and the actual effective tax rate in the United States (the percentage of total income paid in taxes) is comparable or higher than many EU countries (without the benefit of strong social services).  That's before adding in the whole tariff nonsense, which is a regressive tax on the middle and lower classes.  You complain about prices in places outside the US but everyone living in the states is geting nipped elsewhere in the pocketbook in order to have those lower prices (and the US doesn't even have lower prices than the EU anymore after tariffs so it's a double whammy).",Negative
AMD,That's what I'm saying. I am that customer and compared to last year that is not trickling down to me. I agree last year it did but in comparison I don't feel any of it right now so I'm not sure your original point about covid and tariffs applies right now.,Negative
AMD,again the issue is not the money. its the abundance of goods you have access to the united states. not everyone has money i know that. its the same everywhere else.  but nobody on this planet has the same access to goods like Americans. since this is the pc subreddit. how many FE cards are available in the united states and the rest of the world? just compare? or how many FE cards make it to the American market and let say any eastern European nation?   id advise you to visit any part of the world and than compare the states.,Neutral

AMD,"Cost is definitely a big factor - I made the switch within the last few weeks and honestly I have wondered repeatedly why I didn’t do it sooner.  I’m about to move to a much smaller apartment, so we’re trying to get a lot more space efficient, ultimately meaning  no M-ATX tower for me.  I’m currently using a Densium 4+ which is 5.5L, and can fit up to a 220mm GPU (which why ultimately I couldn’t get the 9070 XT Reaper, as it’s 3 fan opposed to the 9060 XT Reaper 2 fan.   I posted a review (if you look at my profile) with some of the pros / cons, since the review I changed GPU (my 6600 XT pictured in the review died lol) but the core of it still applies.

AMD,Nice! I think I'm sold on a Corsair 2000D if I can make the switch. I've always loved the style and dimensions overall since space isn't really a factor overall when it comes to my desk but I was actually shocked at how the Repair sized up overall. It ended up being the same size as my 2 fan Sapphire Pulse 7700XT somehow.   I would like a smaller overall build but I'm reluctant on the itx tax lol.,Positive
AMD,"Again it's reddit which tends to be an AMD echo chamber. Comparing the cards at current prices doesn't even make sense, can't find either for anywhere near MSRP atm.   But back when it was $600 vs $1000 I agreed with most people that 9070 XT was the better buy at $600. But for me $400 more gets better performance across the board in raster and especially RT/PT, along with the entire Nvidia feature stack, so it was worth it. Really just comes down to how much people value features like RT, DLSS, and frame gen.",Negative
AMD,And they're right. They'd be wrong if they said the 9070xt was faster. But nobody's saying that,Neutral

Creating one 9950X3D2 will cost two 9850X3Ds in practice because really good CCDs don't just magically appear. There's a limited supply of very good bins.  Even if 9950X3D2 (the dual V-Cache one) exists, it's not for gamers. It'd be for parallel workloads that require cache and execution consistency. That'd be better under a Pro variant that offers enterprise security features for workstations or even under EPYC 4000-series that can combine higher frequencies and cache use in database operations that are hitting system RAM a bit harder than usual.

There's also a +10c delta hurting the 9850X3D compared to the much cooler and power efficient 9800X3D.

AMD,"Yeah if you want to actually check the performance increase of an overclocked 9800X3D you should run a 720p test or lower, but the thing is the vast majority of 9850X3D buyers are running their games at 1440p or higher on a 4080/90 5070 Ti/80/90 or AMD 7900 XTX / 9070 XT.",Neutral
AMD,You also had active cooling on that ram.,Neutral
AMD,"those are DDR3 voltages, nobody other than people with watercooling daily 1.5+v",Neutral
AMD,"sorry, I also replied to this other comment you just made, if you're happy with it then just keep it, even if doesn't make any sense for anything 5080 and below.",Neutral
AMD,"> if it was then they wouldn't have needed to bump the stock core voltage to 1.3v  The spec VID range for all zen 5 CPU's, vcache or not, goes up to 1.42 VID. There is no voltage range change on the 9850x3d.",Neutral
AMD,"I mean I agree - I have no idea if my 9800X3D can handle the higher speeds as I'm content with it stock (still under the cheapest TR dual-tower I could find at MicroCenter, haven't gotten my custom loop built yet).  I think it's more just that these CPUs can reliably handle the speeds, whereas not all 9800X3D CPUs could.  Also still wondering about the memory controller, but I understand that that's an insensitive thing to ask about these days lol",Negative
AMD,"And the result will be obvious: almost zero difference in performance.  If you have a speed limit of 60 mph on the highway, don't be surprised when the ferrari drives at the same speed as a toyota.",Negative
AMD,"Mm. I started out with 1.5v. Ran that for a short while. Then 1.55v and a 120mm fan, hanging from the case with zipties. If voltage would have killed RAM instantly, it would have killed it with or without fan/cooling.",Neutral
AMD,"BS. Very few watercool their RAM. All you need is ANY kind of fan blowing on the RAM when going past 1.5v. And that is not to keep them alive, it is to keep them stable. RAM will spit out bit-errors way before they die. Normal DDR4 is rated for 85 C. Generally, it is best to keep them under 50-55 C if you overclock them.    DDR3 default is 1.65v, yes. What do people that OC ram on DDR5 run? Is it 1.4-1.5v? And default is 1.1-1.2v. Of course, XMP profiles for even DDR5 often runs at 1.4v. Have you heard of millions of RAM sticks dying?",Neutral
AMD,While running medium/ light loads (gaming) the core voltage now jumps to 1.3v+ while the 9800X3D stays around 1.1v,Neutral
AMD,"The memory controller is also the same, they're not developing a new IMC or upgrading the current one just for a factory overclocked 9800X3D, they're doing that for Zen 6. We've had 9850X3D users here stating that their CPU can't handle certain RAM configurations that they could achieve with a 9800X3D. It's just a silicon lottery. You might swap your 9800X3D for this factory overclocked CPU and get a worse IMC compared to what you had.  If the memory controller was any better AMD would have marketed the fact non-stop while charging extra money for it.",Negative
AMD,"DDR5 is irrelevant here, I'm talking about DDR4 voltages - and honestly I'm barely acquainted with DDR5 OC. DDR4 EXPO/XMP generally doesn't go over 1.4v and I don't know where you get the idea that many people daily 1.55-1.65v.",Negative
AMD,"Especially DDR 5 and crazy so dual rank DDR 5 is next level sensitive to temperature for single errors (classic 10k Karhu single errors)  So you're dead on, at least on AM5, no one in their right mind would daily sticks voltage high enough to kill them.",Negative
AMD,"The CPU's won't use more VID than they need to hit the maximum frequency that is on their boost table, even if it's safe and available.  For the 9800x3d out of the box, that means that whatever voltage that it takes to hit ~5225mhz is the maximum that you'll see. You may have had a 9800x3d which would be happy at 5500mhz with normal gaming voltage, but since 5225 was an arbitrary limit, the CPU would sit at 5225. It will then use the voltage that it thinks that it needs for 5225mhz, rather than using the full voltage.  Removing fmax and other limits so that you only hit the voltage/reliability limiters exposes the actual voltage range.  Likewise, applying an fmax limit to another CPU like the 9850x3d or the 9950x3d's vcache CCD brings behavior in line with 9800x3d (just deleting all of the frequency options near the top of the curve).  If you're riding the safety limiter at 1x scalar, then about 1.34 VID on zen5 (x3d or standard) is typical in games.",Neutral
AMD,"Ah, cool. I wasn't sure if they improved over a stepping or whatever else (been known to happen).  Yeah I'm aware that they're redoing it for Zen 6, which will be perfect timing-wise. Zen 5 can't really make use of faster memory outside of niche cases.",Positive

AMD,advanced users that tweak and run active cooling on ram sometimes forget the average casual users don't run fans on their ram and what they are doing applies to a very small percentage of people.,Neutral
AMD,I'm doing scalar x1 and never seen anything beyond 1.15v,Neutral
AMD,"I didn't know they made DDR4-4800/5333 sticks, do people actually run these in ""regular"" builds?   Browsing OC-centered sites won't give you a realistic image of the general population, most people don't OC much and run at <1.5v (they're also afraid of the numbers turning red in the BIOS).    >Where do I get the idea? Watching RAM OC content like Buildzoid, being on the Overclocking subreddit, overclockers.co.uk etc for the past 10-15 years.   Cool, I've been on the internet for a little while too :\^)",Neutral
AMD,"If that is the case, then your CPU is restricted in software to a maximum boost frequency which is well below its capabilities, and it just never botheres to use a medium-high voltage because it's always running at a frequency which is stable with a low voltage. The scalar will allow for ~1.34 VID and there is hundreds of mhz of stable clock gain between 1.15v and 1.34v.  The 9800x3d can buy +200mhz via the PBO controls, but otherwise you need async eclk to fully bypass AMD's frequency lockouts.",Neutral
AMD,"I grabbed one in a Micro Center bundle.  The pricing works that way (though is comparatively the same).  I didn’t need it and know it doesn’t matter, but I needed a bundle anyways and we have 3x AM5 systems in the family, soon to be 4.  Everybody gets a bump.",Neutral
AMD,Opinions on 9850x3d? Even for people who dont own a 9800x3d this refresh chip takes a pretty huge hit in efficiency for its minor performance uplifts.  I was planning on upgrading to this but considering I build in SFF is might just be better to pick the 9800x3d instead (especially with the price drops)  Id say this itteration is mid. Luckily it doesnt cost much more but thats about it,Negative
AMD,"I'm jealous of these bundles with CPU, RAM, and mobo you can get in US here in UK there is nothing like that.",Negative
AMD,.44,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, IMO the margin doesn't justify the gains, just like most modern TDP-boosted chips. It certainly has its place, though, and I imagine it does better than the 9800X3D when given the 9800X3D's power budget.",Neutral
AMD,waiting for zen 6 still rocking a 7500f,Neutral
AMD,If the 9800X3D didn’t exist I’d imagine no one would be really talking about the power draw of the 9850X3D for the level of performance delivered.  What will be interesting to see is how well it undervolts. It’s such a highly binned version of this chip I would not be surprised if it can be made to run cooler than a 9800X3D if set close to 9800X3D performance.,Neutral
AMD,"MSRP vs MSRP it's fine ($20 more). With the 9800X3D at $449 though, that's a much better value. I think with how the prices change, the value of each other will fluctuate. At most I'd pay 10% more for up to 5% performance bump. For comparison a 5090 is 3x to 4x the price of a 5080 at 50% higher performance. A 10% price increase for a halo product is nice, but not essential.   Hidden value king from this though is definitely the 7800X3D. Can sometimes be found even cheaper than a 5800X3D.",Positive
AMD,I wouldn't pay more for it than the 9800x3d,Neutral
AMD,In Canada we have similar bundles but the pricing is insane on all parts right now.  Its a major turn off.,Negative
AMD,"I just built a 9800x3d over the weekend 449 at microcenter. Coming from intel the 9800 power usage is amazing. I could return and get the new 50 but I’m not worried about it.  If it was already out sure I probably would have gone 9850 but I’ll take my power draw win and enjoy it for a long time. I’m so used to seeing high temps and fighting throttles, this cpu is awesome.",Positive
AMD,Amazing dedication. Im not so patient apparently even though I have a 7700x haha,Positive
AMD,"Hmmm. True, I'll wait and see if there anything that comes out with more testing. But frankly stock for stock, Id pick the cheaper one right now. After a point, a better cpu doesnt net huge gains, speaking for myself at the very least",Neutral
AMD,"don't do it unless you're playing on a 5090 at 1080 high settings, wasted power efficiency and thermals for barely any gains at 1440 high/ultra.",Negative
AMD,Nah I don’t plan to. I’m on 3440x1440 with 7900xtx and quite happy. Looking forward to running the 9800x3d for at least 4 years.,Positive
AMD,Should I return my 9850X3D and get the 9800X3D? It was a tiny price difference.,Neutral
AMD,Linus said the trade off isn't that bad at all,Neutral
AMD,"Yep, and if you didn't get a lemon then you can always manually overclock it if you wanna have a 9850X3D for free, I've sometimes set my 9800X3D to 5700 MHz at 1.25v and it's rock solid stable with the same power draw and thermals than the factory overclocked 9850X3D, but I'm playing on a 4080 at 1440p ultra settings so the difference was laughable, I reverted back to PBO+100 and scalar x1, incredibly power efficient with per-core curve optimizer and gaming at 41-47c.",Positive
AMD,"if you don't care about the increased power draw and thermals then no, it's not the end of the world and will just hurt it in the summer time if your cooler is mediocre, but I wonder why you decided to go with that CPU to pair with a 6950XT.",Negative
AMD,Looks like you bought it lol,Neutral

From the moment it was announced and AMD revealed its internal benchmarks, it was clear that we were dealing with a CPU that offered marginal, single-digit performance increases over the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. Even when being charitable to the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, it fails to meet muster.  It’s a worse value than the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, consumes more power, and just barely claims a new top slot in our gaming rankings. The extra juice isn’t worth the squeeze here. That’s even more true when you factor in PBO, which itself can bring up the clock speed of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D by 200MHz and likely close the performance gap"" /Quote",Positive
AMD,Well that depends if your cooling is overkill enough to not matter. Otherwise its 10c° or more in heat,Neutral
AMD,I haven't changed my flair yet. I upgraded my GPU too a couple of days ago to 9070XT. My CPU cooler is the Peerless Assassin.,Neutral
AMD,Hahaha yes I couldn't resist. It's a freaking monster.,Negative
AMD,"you won't see any difference compared to a 9800X3D, but who knows, maybe you will get a 5090 or 6090 at some point, but if you have deep pockets for a 5090 or 6090 then you should have bought / waited for a 9950X3D-2 instead.",Neutral
AMD,The 5090 is on a league of its own. It costs 4000 euros minimum here compared to the 9070XT which cost me 799. I have the money for the 5090 but I really cannot justify it in any way shape or form considering I mostly play CPU bound games.,Negative
AMD,"just enjoy your new CPU, it should be a noticeable difference compared to the 7700X playing those CPU-bound games at 1080p high, or 1440p with DLSS. More playing, less Reddit doom-scrolling.",Positive

AMD,"it's fine, just fine",Positive
AMD,Maube it scales better with tuning? Like UV etc?,Neutral
AMD,I'm more curious for when the dual v-cache comes out how much better will it perform compared to it's normal counter part,Positive
AMD,"It runs 10-20w more and it also runs 5-10 degrees hotter than the 9800X3D for 3% gains?? It even? Yeah, no thank you. I’ll stick to 9800X3D until zen 6 comes out",Negative
AMD,"Well, I'm considering upgrading from 7700X so performance difference would be great!",Positive
AMD,I upgraded into AM5 with this processor coming from a 5800x3D. Big difference for me all around but I agree probably not worth it coming from a 9800 or maybe even a 7800 chip,Negative
AMD,"1080p testing has its place, you kinda want to know how it performs when not gpu bottlenecked and you can be more sure of future performance viability in realistic situations.   However showing higher resolutions equally has its place, because real performance is important too and if you're acting in good will towards your audience, you wouldn't want them to run and purchase something that they don't really need.   It's like you'd be testing a car, put it on a dyno and claim it's the only relevant metric, and completely disregard real track testing.     Both are equally important",Neutral
AMD,Way better reviews out there.,Positive
AMD,How come der8auer and other media outlets manage to test this cpu (and show essentially the same outcomes) at meaningful resolutions/settings (example: 1440p ultra with raytracing) while amdunboxed show these idiotic 1080p medium settings scenarios? Completely unnecessary.,Negative
AMD,Soo pointless,Negative
AMD,"It's 6% faster in counterstrike, and 7% faster in battelfield 6  Using averages includes cherry picking semi gpu bound games. Averages are a damn lie.",Negative
AMD,Is the performance hit also 2-3% on the 9800x3d and 7800x3d?,Neutral
AMD,I mean I upgraded from a 10 year old cpu to 9800x3d and there's practically zero difference at 4k even then so.... yea,Neutral
AMD,Just check benchmarks with the 9800x3D and +3-5% lol,Neutral
AMD,It runs hotter and uses 20% more energy for maybe a 5% gain in fps if even,Neutral
AMD,"Their reaction is meant to be like ""what's the purpose of this release really? Only 3% improvement at 1080p, why does this even exist when the 9800x3d already exist.""",Negative
AMD,You must be a very fragile person if a tech review hurt your feelings...,Negative
AMD,"By that line of reasoning every GPU test should also be done with a 7500F and slow RAM, but somehow I never see people argue for real world scenarios there. These real world scenarios people want are at best separate videos, which they have done a few times at least. It doesn't belong into a component test. It's a waste of time and effort to show you a bar graph where every bar is the same length.  It's also very easy to get the numbers you want from a GPU review of the GPU you have. These are your real world results for 4K. It's the GPU limit 99% of the time.",Negative
AMD,I like 1080p testing because it reflects the internal res i play at (960p from 1440P+DLSSQ),Positive
AMD,The fact that people still do not understand cpu testing in 2026 is wild to me. You use 1080p resolution because it is a CPU test not a gpu test. Higher resolutions tests tell you nothing about the cpu.,Negative
AMD,"Well, 1080p is the ideal resolution for CPU tests as it drastically reduces GPU bottlenecks and benchmarks the CPU, providing variable control.",Positive
AMD,"If a RTX 5090 takes 8 millisecond to render a frame at ultra settings, but the CPU only takes up 7.3 milliseconds, then ultimately the fps will be based on the ""slowest"" performing part which is the 5090 in this case.   I recalled in games of the idTech engine, you could see separate CPU & GPU render time, showing which component is the main bottleneck.",Neutral
AMD,Because they want to test the cpu and not the gpu. You need to remove the bottleneck as well as you can.,Neutral
AMD,"I mean this is to show performance delta when cpu performance does matter. If you want native results for gpu bound scenarios at high resolutions, you'll find you can pair a 7500f with a 5090 and be happy enough. Plus having extra cpu headroom certainly helps once you upgrade gpu in the future and real world results would use upscaling which makes it more cpu bound again.  TLDR; this benchmark isn't to show what the end user experiences but the difference in raw gaming potential that each of these cpu's can achieve.",Neutral
AMD,"Pointless to upgrade from other AM5 x3d chip, ok if you're buying into AM5, because premium over 9800x3D is small.",Neutral
AMD,More supply of something faster is always welcomed,Positive
AMD,It's 30$ more for 6% faster in counterstrike and 7% faster in battlefield 6  whats the problem?,Neutral
AMD,"A population of people on here will snap it up to upgrade their 9800x3d ""because I like it""  rinse and repeat ad nauseum. Happens with each and every upgrade.  Same deal will happen with the 9950x3d2 or whatever bullshit 1% improvement that gets.  35% extra power usage it looks like from 9800x3d -> 9850x3d, so probably thermal throttles much easier.",Negative
AMD,"Averages are data, but you should really look at the game you play and see what the real world benefit is. 7% faster is worth the 50 to 100 bucks i lose by selling my 9800.",Neutral
AMD,9800X3D Super,Positive
AMD,It exists to hold them over till Zen 6 releases because nova lake comes out at the end of this year,Neutral
AMD,They absolutely do. 1440p or 4k dlss performance with crazy raytracing is still insanely cpu intensive and not as braindead as 1080p medium which shows nothing.,Negative
AMD,Might as well do 720p low then. No reason to do medium 1080p. It’s just arbitrary hardware unboxed incompetence as usual.,Negative
AMD,"The 9800X3D is way below MSRP now so premium is actually pretty big, at least where I live.",Positive
AMD,"Don't worry, with these ram prices there will be plenty of supplies.",Positive
AMD,"I personally have to see around ~150-200% performance boost for me to upgrade. If im upgrading, im upgrading everything.

Companies hate my 1 trick lol. 35% is nice if you dont have any cpu near 2 yrs ago. Just not worth the price imo. But I guess more power to them.",Positive
AMD,"My point is the new cpu is actually legit 6 to 7% faster   But the problem is that the 9800x3d is already gpu bottle necking many games   And thats a major problem with averages, they don't show how fast the cpu actually is, it shows how gpu dependent games are.   If new more cpu heavy games come out in the future, or you get a faster gpu in the future, the faster cpu will have more longevity than the slower one   For you, and many new buyers, its worth it, but averages don't tell you that   15 game averages just don't work to show how fast a cpu actually is",Neutral
AMD,U have no idea what u are talking about,Negative
AMD,Actually 720p can decrease performance nowadays.  Edit: also 1080p is still the most used resolution. 720p is outdated. 1080p is more than enough to test cpu performance without gou bottleneck. In many cases you could even test on 1440p with minimal gpu bottleneck.,Negative
AMD,Win - win to me :),Positive
AMD,"This is true, although am5 has been around long enough where there are plenty of people in the market for a cpu upgrade, but dont necessarily have to upgrade their ram.",Neutral
AMD,"thats kind of just a given with benchmarking in general.  CPUs and GPUs are not these single order pieces of machinery that spit widgets per second.  some will handle some things better, even within the same very game!  if you really truly care about your $500 purchase, find a benchmark using the game you play or software you use.  its just, thats not practical for every single game.  i personally play at 4k and 5k, and as you can imagine benchmarks at those settings are incredibly rare.  most times it doesnt matter!  but in my performance bracket, 5% upgrades are rare, and I jump on them. PC gaming is what I spend 14 hours a day doing, it matters to me. :D",Neutral
AMD,Except he makes more sense than the 1080p low defenders. Useless numbers vs real world usecase numbers.,Negative
AMD,One thing a lot of people don't realize is 4k dlss performance is actually 1080p,Neutral
AMD,"Basically every pro / competitive player in relevant games like CS, Valorant, Fortnite, Cod / Warzone , R6 siege, PUBG, Rocket league, Apex & League plays on 1080p low or even 4/3 & 16/10 resolutions like 1440x1080, 1280x9060 & 1680x1050.   That's a significant part of the market for high end cpus. The hard to swallow pill is that 1080p low isn't even low enough quality testing for the people who actually get real value from cpus like the x3ds and 14900k.",Neutral
AMD,"Funny how I never see you people complain about GPU testing with the fastest CPU and RAM available. Where are all the real world considerations then? These are component tests, not real world demonstrations.",Negative

AMD,The most interesting part of this review is the inclusion of DDR5-4800 which proved almost as fast as their regular test setup in most of the gaming tests.,Positive
AMD,Pretty sure I read the review embargo is going to be lifted tomorrow 1/29 lol,Neutral
AMD,"I don't get the constant mentions of the 9800x3d, as if this was ever going to be an upgrade for 9800x3d owners.  ""It's just 4%!"", ok, but to the target demographic, people who are finally coming into AM5, this is a good cpu for the extra 30$.",Negative
AMD,This uses more power for tiny performance increase. Pass.  So when is zen6 coming out?,Neutral

AMD,How much better is it compared to the 7800x3d?   Worth upgrading or am I fine,Positive
AMD,Was it released today ? Can’t find any listings,Neutral
AMD,At least it'd still let me retire my 2700x.,Neutral
AMD,And yet Intels KS cpus got a better reception for half the uplift. Its not an upgrade for 9800 owners its an upgrade for eveyone else. Of course some of them will buy it but thats what people with more money than brains do. I've been one of those.   Its a great cpu at a tiny premuim over its brother. Meanwhile Intel charged a much larger premuim and was praised more for it. I dont get it.,Positive
AMD,Oh no Steve is getting old!,Negative
AMD,"Still gonna roll the dice and see if I get a better IMC, my 9800X3D has no problem doing 5.75 with a 106 eCLK and +200 PBO but the IMC will not do 6400 1:1 under any circumstances.  Upgrading is not worth 500 dollars of course, but to me it's worth the 150ish it'll cost me after I resell my 9800X3D.",Neutral

AMD,Would that mean even the 9800X3D and 7800X3D performs almost the same with 4800MHz ram?,Neutral

AMD,"exactly. if this was an option a month ago when i built my pc, i of course would have gotten this instead of a 9800x3d... but i’m not going to upgrade to this now.",Negative
AMD,"I don't think the intent is to show it as a poor upgrade from the 9800X3D (though, it is true).  >people who are finally coming into AM5, this is a good cpu for the extra 30$.  Or even from people upgrading within AM5. The 7600/7600x to the 9850X3D is a pretty notable jump in CPU performance.",Neutral
AMD,"It is kinda insane seeing people think this is not worth it. The target audience pair this up with at least the 5080.   Paying $30 more to get 4% more out of something that costs 1k+ is basically a **no-brainer**. If looking strictly at MSRP, practically no one with a brain will buy the 9800X3D over the 9850X3D.   The only question becomes how much discount you can get with a 9800X3D.",Negative
AMD,"Imagine we upgrade to this instead of 9800x3d.  Won't there be a higher risk of cpu failure, given it's probably under higher stress?  I'm still not confident about the 9800x3d failure reports...",Negative
AMD,"Depending if the newcomers are pairing their CPU with a 5090 or not, the very moment you use the 9850X3D with a 5080 or a 5070 Ti level GPU at 1440p high settings the difference between the 9800X3D and the factory overclocked part becomes null.   However, the factory overclocked part will still be much more power hungry and will run hotter regardless of the performance. In that case buy a 9800X3D and use those 30 bucks to buy a game on Steam.  I know most of you can't help yourselves and will still buy a 9850 to pair with a 4070 Ti or a 9070 XT just to say ""I have the latest"", even if it's just a 14 month old CPU which has been overclocked back at the factory.",Neutral
AMD,"all other things equal, i agree.   ~~since 9850x3d isnt bundled currently whereas others are, you can get more than $30 savings moving to AM5. at least a new mobo and especially if you require DDR5 the difference grows.~~ Microcenter has already dropped bundles, nvm",Positive

AMD,Any cpu bound game will. We got plenty of tests out there showing a 10 to 20% increase depending on ram speed. X3d chips reduce the value of fast ram due to the larger cache and less need of moving data from the ram to the cpu constantly.,Neutral

DDR4-2400 vs DDR4-3200 was a 20% performance difference in game. Single channel vs duel channel was an additional 20% performance difference on top of that. Now imagine the difference DDR-2133 vs DDR-3600 would have on an AM4 CPU.

AMD,"Yes, thank you.  Will correct.",Positive
AMD,"not even worth upgrading over the 7800X3D in my opinion, im looking forward to zen 6 or zen 7",Positive
AMD,No one knows that except for AMD. There have been reports on more than just the 9800X3D failing (seen 9600 and 9700 as well).   If the reason for the failure is related to what is required to get higher clock speeds then maybe; alternatively the failures could be something totally different like a manufacturing defect that impacts a certain percentage of chips. Alternatively maybe it’s just an Asus / Asrock thing.   Maybe the 9850X3D will be more reliable since it is a binned 9800X3D so best of the best silicon.,Negative
AMD,I think that's the whole purpose of 9850X3D - to fix the issue 9800X3D has. They just didn't want to admit it's their fault.,Negative
AMD,"> Depending if the newcomers are pairing their CPU with a 5090 or not, the very moment you use the 9850X3D with a 5080 or a 5070 Ti level GPU at 1440p high settings the difference between the 9800X3D and the factory overclocked part becomes null.  You say that as if most people aren't running their games using DLSS or FSR, at either Quality or Balanced these days (especially DLSS 4 or DLSS 4.5 in the case you don't use RT, it's almost a no brainer to run Balanced instead of quality).  Meaning those benchmarks at 1440p native are meaningless.  You have to look at 1080p benchmarks to know what kind of benefits your CPU will give you when your GPU is running lower internal resolution.  That's not to mention every game is different and some are just CPU hungry, while others are much more GPU limited.  So yes, even for a gamer at 1440p high settings, there will be benefits.  It's 30$, the power and heat differences are negligeable.  It's still not worth upgrading from the 9800x3D if you already have it, of course, but for a new buyer looking at that CPU, it's not a wasted 30$ at all.",Neutral

AMD,"All chips suffer with slower RAM, just not as much as people imply. X3D hits that problem less frequently because of the cache but that doesn't mean it will never do so. Some of the tests in this very post (and yours) even show that.  If you care about performance don't get RAM with garbage latency. Having an X3D doesn't save you from that statement.     Edit: Techspot's examples are even a rather extreme 50% worse latency with a flagship GPU. You're going to notice smaller gaps on the kinds of systems that might have non-X3D chips in them, especially if they aren't running base jedec speeds even if the memory is still below 6000 (or 8000).",Negative

I can't imagine upgrading from the 7800x3D, which is still an amazing chip.",Positive
AMD,"Nah, a new product is released to increase profit, not to fix issues they don't want to admit that exist with design flaws.  This product is most likely aimed at increasing prices, by setting a new higher profit margin, at nearly the same cost to produce.",Negative
AMD,"Yes, but it still depends on your GPU, 1440p ultra settings DLSS Quality on a 5070 Ti and you won't see any difference between the 9800X3D and the factory overclocked version they sell at a premium. No matter if you're playing space marine 2 or cyberpunk with path tracing.   You need to understand that the 5090 is orders of magnitude faster than anything else in the market and Hardware Unboxed found a 4% difference on average at 1080p medium settings on that beast of a GPU. Just turn PBO+200 on a 9800X3D and that difference will be down to 1 or 2%. Now imagine you have anything else than a 5090, it's hilarious that some people expect double digit performance improvements on a 5070 - 5080 running DLSS.   The only thing you can expect is that the factory overclocked 9800X3D they're selling with a fancy new name will run hotter and will draw more power. It should be such an easy purchase decision but nowadays FOMO rules everything and you make excuses and false expectations out of thin air just to get the newest... even when the newest is actually a 14 month old factory overclocked CPU.

AMD,"I agree.  But for new builders like myself that isnt already on AM5, totally worth it.",Positive
AMD,"As a counterexample, I'm moving from 7600x to x3d and was waiting for the reviews before pulling the trigger.  I decided to go for the 9800 in the end, we're talking about some 10 celsius difference in gaming with a 360 aio for 4% performance in 1080p, which is not worth for me.",Neutral
AMD,I am not even sure if the 9800x3d is worth it over the 7800x3d. 120€ for 10€ performance. The 7800x3d is a pretty good deal atm. Now another 50€ for 3 to 4%... nah...,Negative
AMD,Yeah the 7800x3d is still a great cpu.  I've been running one for the last couple years and I'll be set for the rest of AM5 imo.  The only thing that could tempt me to upgrade to another AM5 cpu would be if they release a 16 core x3d chip that has the extra cache on both ccd's.,Positive
AMD,"That is true, even if the difference won't be exactly groundbreaking, barely noticeable I would say... you want an actual upgrade then wait for Zen 6. This is, if you have to buy right now, you might want to assess whether you prefer an ever so slightly faster CPU for those games or maybe a cheaper, much cooler and efficient processor.",Neutral
AMD,"Are you playing your games at 720p on your 9070 XT at medium settings? Then congrats, you can get 5 additional frames if you get a 9850X3D instead of a 9800X3D, but it will run hotter while drawing more power.  On the other hand, you can get a much cooler and efficient 9800X3D and use the 30 bucks to buy a game.  A lot of users are completely ignoring the fact that most reviewers are using a 5090 at 1080p to review the factory overclocked 14 month old CPU. Are you buying a 5090 and playing at 1080p ?",Neutral
AMD,"None, just that for a bit more you can get a fully new CPU that might very well have a better memory controller, so in good faith you should be open about the capabilities of the used part you're selling (not just the IMC, but also that it was overclocked for X amount of time.",Neutral

That's just not true.  The 5070 Ti is quite powerful enough to where it can get bottlenecked by the CPU, especially once you start pushing DLSS usage.  It's highly dependent on the game.  Not all games are Cyberpunk 2077 with full Path Tracing.  People already gave you CPU bottlenecked examples of games, and that's before we even factor people using DLSS 4.5 at Balanced or even performance because DLSS 4.5 without RT is just really that good.  > You need to understand that the 5090 is orders of magnitude faster  I think you need to calm down and understand that the 5090 is not the only thing bottlenecked by CPUs.  The problem with HUB, GN, Jayz and others is that they completely ignore DLSS and FSR as a thing when benchmarking and have made people unable to understand how upscaling can in fact increase CPU usage through higher framerate and thus more frame preparation.  > The only thing you can expect is that the factory overclocked 9800X3D they're selling with a fancy new name will run hotter and will draw more power.

Its a bit similar to the Intel problems, where they were the ones pushing way to much power into the cpus, and Intel being the one not enforcing stricter rules.  It could be coincidental that AMD itself proclaimed 4800 DDR5 only being slightly slower, but thats the opposite  everything AMD used to do when DDR5 wasn't as expensive, even sending 8000 Kits with the boards because that would give you 1% more performance in that single usecase instead of using a good 6000 kit.  I mean 4800 kits aren't that much cheaper than most 56/6000 kits, and the usability if you change your system would be worse for that 4800 kit.  The thing that people won't do when using 4800 kits, is enabling xmp/expo.  There also have been multiple tests by outlets, which have shown how the power consumption goes up, sometimes a lot, just enabling xmp/expo, which makes sense if the voltages are way higher.  Everyone just assumed the voltages set by the boards were safe, now it seems the were on the edge the whole time, and when the process nodes are shrinking, higher voltages get more problematic.",Negative

AMD,honestly the general rule with BIOS updates is if your system is stable and working fine then there's not much reason to rush into an update. what i've learned over the years is that BIOS updates are more for fixing specific issues or adding compatibility for new hardware rather than preventive maintenance. from what i've seen the issue seems primarily tied to the 9800X3D and specific board configurations but ASUS hasn't been super clear about the full scope. if you're running a non-X3D chip and everything is stable i'd probably wait until there's more clarity or unless you actually need features from the new BIOS. the rollback restriction is concerning so i'd only update if you're experiencing actual problems or ASUS specifically recommends it for your exact setup.,Neutral

AMD,"I own a highend x3d cpu, if you check the temps it can soar suddenly before the fan can pick up and dissipate the heat  so if you have bad motherboard capacitors, a bad psu, insufficient cooling and bad silicon luck I can completely see how the cpu can pull too much juice to boost or overclock and slowly kill itself  it's made even worse for the two cccd cpu's they pull more power and the sandwiched chips retain more heat, undervolting doesn't help because the chip ramps up higher seeing it has more headroom  most users don't want to run it in eco mode to limit the amount of power it can pull, I would say the bios defaults for these boards is overly agressive on the pbo/auto overclocking, the sudden ramp in voltage and watts causes a spike in temp that physically damages the chip if high enough, repeat it enough times and the chip and/or motherboard fries itself and fails the POST check  some motherboards claim it's great for overclocking, but when you look at the physical number of vram chips and capacitors, and calculate the power, current and resistance you quickly see if it were actually to pull the amount of power a high end cpu can boost too, the heat would overwhelm the system",Negative

AMD,They launched that one so everyone needing a new CPU after the last one burnt up will get a slight upgrade when they replace it.  Imagine if they made a CPU that didn't have a builtin self destruct. They'd only be selling a new CPU every time the consumer felt like buying one instead.,Neutral

AMD,This is the last thing I want to hear after just recently putting together a 9800x3d build. I am on a Gigabyte board though and not seeing their board pop up in this mess.,Negative
AMD,Correct. Cropped up first on ASRock boards but now the issue is spreading across brands. Earlier CPU batches seem to be most affected.,Negative

AMD,The voltage spike thing is also why I got a beefier PSU than required.  I think a lot of people here use 850W with maybe a 5070Ti. The spikes would probably cause the PSU to hit above limit after other components are accounted for when running a 9800x3d. I upgraded mine to 1200w after my 850w one melted (not cpu related) and seems like it’s handling my EPYC 4585px well enough. A power spike on an under capacity PSU could kill chips.   I’d suggest at least 1000w for 9800x3d/9850x3d and at least 1200w for 9950x3d. If you use a 5090 nothing short of 1300w would work.,Neutral

AMD,"V-Cache seems to make it more fragile due to the copper pillars (TSVs) that need to stay in alignment. CCDs also use SoC when communicating to IOD via GMI. VDDG CCD and IOD should also not exceed SoC voltage. I run my 5800X3D at 1.050V SoC and VDDGs are 1.025v. But, 5800X3D only has a voltage tolerance of 1.2V, with 1.1V being nominal during actual running. Hynix DDR4 kits always required higher VSoC to work properly. I hated that and switched to B-Die before getting my 5800X3D. The 9800X3D allegedly has a VSoC tolerance of up to 1.3V.  There is still the possibility of these being slightly defective and bonding process created a slight misalignment that wasn't caught in QA. Seems to cover any production fab and date (based on reports), so not sure if that's it.   Something is causing these failures and I'd center on poor voltage AND current controls (or overly aggressive when EXPO is enabled) on the motherboard. A millisecond voltage spike probably won't kill anything, but a current spike in conjunction with that extra voltage? Yikes!",Negative
AMD,"2x asus b850e rog strix, 2x 9700x both chips dead after bios updates back in April/may. Both begin way overvolting after bios updates.  Msi x870e edge ti + 9700x and no problems.",Negative

AMD,"Same, I ordered a gigabyte for my build, I hope it works",Positive
AMD,"""now issue is spreading to other brands""...     no... the issue has ALWAYS appeared on other brands, in fact the initial issues originated on an asus board to begin with. It's just that due to copious amount of bias and willfully blindness, almost everyone INSISTS that asrock was the only manufacturer, apparently the posts prior.. during and after the claim was made that asrock was predominantly the the one and only...  ""but the stats show asrock has...."" even the creator of that stat collection admits and clearly states that due to the individual posts being recorded that numerous, tons of posts were put under the ""asrock"" counter even though it was shown NOT to be an asrock board, to the point of putting the disclaimer that it's bias against asrock.  Honestly people need to get this out of their head that somehow this was an asrock problem, it never was, it was a universal problem. As far as what the problem is, even gamersnexus's own board they received that supposedly claimed 2 separate 9800x3D's life, having been put through their ringer, showed actually exceptional results of doing precisely what it was supposed to do and very well, and they've had that for what, 3 months now with ZERO problems reported which further suggests that the rule holds most likely true, user error being the primary likely cause.",Negative

AMD,had a asus b650 tuf gaming plus  board since 2022 with a 7800x3d and upgraded recently to a 9800x3d.  electronics are funny stuff,Positive
AMD,"Soooo, failure rate is supposed to be 0% across the board and if it isn't there is some major fault somewhere?  I hope you understand that electronics are bound to die prematurely or arrive DOA from time to time. QA problems, unknown issues, shipping, bad handling, etc... ASUS failure rate from the links you sent was pretty normal considering the popularity of the brand and sales they achieve. It started getting out of hand recently.  Just because the megathread includes non-X3D as well doesn't mean that they get fried the same way as X3D does. They are literally including them because that's how statistics works. You won't just ignore things. Whole point of including the non-X3D is to prove that X3D is the problem. The link you sent includes 165 X3D failures and 16 non-X3D failures. You shouldn't have counted either, they summed up everything near the end of the post.  It's good that you like to use ""evidence"". Now all that's left is to add the context and you'll have the objective picture.  Also, I'm sorry that you took my feelings comment personally. I didn't mean that. That's why there is no need to take this further, good luck to you.",Negative
AMD,Damn. What about the mobo? Is that still working 100% normally or did that get fried too?,Negative
AMD,"Amps never stay the same. Wattage is voltage x amperage. In order for wattage to increase, amps must rise when voltage is static. If you undervolt, by definition, you must pull more amps.",Neutral
AMD,That is correct.,Neutral
AMD,"Like you said, its pretty normal for the amount of Asus boards, and overall, it still is with the amount of boards they sell.   The second megathread has 80 x3d to 51 non x3d failures. Seems the issues is becoming worse. It went from  <10% and increased to 64% of what we have recorded.  Which is why i brought it up, the statistics are relevant and point to something within the whole line of 9xxx cpus, potentially a board manufacturer, but again the only real commonality is the 9xxx line.  If you want to ignore data thats fine, but saying to add context when we dont know the problem is a problem.   Having context implies we have the whole story to make sense of the details, at the bare minimum, having context means we can make sense of the details on its own. We cant, there is no context.  Like i said, we just dont know what the kryptonite is yet, thats the major fault. I never said there wasnt one, as qell as never said theres a problem, only that something is going on.   Again the only one seeming to base things on feelings, is yourself. The only one guessing has been you, stating its only on x3d with 800 chipset. When we have evidence its not only x3d, and not only 800 chipset. You scoffed at multiple brands, i showed you its not. You claimed asus only started this 3 weeks ago, i showed you they didnt.  If you want to keep spreading misinformation, do so. Ill keep basing things on my ""feelings""",Negative

The 7950x is below MSRP too with the bare minimum of searching. The 5950x pricing varies more, but it's out of production and the last 16 core processor that can take DDR4 RAM.   >just look at how prices of mini PC's and raspberry pi's have gone up by like 2-3x after AI bubble hit to the point that you have minisforum sell mini PC's with no RAM and storage included  Everything that uses DRAM has had the costs go up. For a low price lower margin product that will inflate the price more. If it's harder to secure a stable supply of a component and the price of said component goes up a ton the economics of a $30-40 dollar SoC goes out the window.   Anything using DRAM or NAND will have the price increase or the margins worsen.

AMD,"I've been thinking for a while that the problem is actually something like bad solder paste application where the socket is soldered to the board, like the mask was offset or too much was used or something and once enough current goes through the bad solder joint it creates it either melts and goes where it's supposed to or melts and goes where it shouldn't. It's the only thing left that makes sense to me after seeing some of these boards still work after the socket was replaced with no apparent defects that could be found... maybe there's no defect found because repairing the board to where it can even be tested wipes out the evidence of the issue. I don't think I've ever seen anyone do electrical continuity tests on all the pins in the burned socket to see if there are any pins bridged that shouldn't be beyond shared common VCC or ground. It would definitely be more widespread if it was an AMD production issue but it's pretty clearly limited almost completely to ASRock. It's simply logical to suspect that when all the boards still work when testing, the minimal repair to the burner area required to even test them is fixing what was wrong to begin with.",Neutral

AMD,Whatever GN has done. The fact are still there. ASrock boards still had major issues when other board brands doesn't. ASrock can't even fix this with a quick bios change like Asus did.,Negative
AMD,"It could be a design flaw that is inherent in the CPU, and that Asrock motherboards just make it more apparent. The fact that AM5 CPUs have died for all motherboard vendors does make me think that.",Negative
AMD,"They are popular but ASROCK is not selling more than MSI, Gigabyte or ASUS. The Taichi models were popular because they had provided very solid offerings for a good price the last few generations.   Even if they sold a lot, go to another sub and see how many reports of sudden processor failure that you find. You’re going to be hard pressed to find a mention of it on other subs because it’s hardly ever happening with other brands. Even ASUS (who has come into the spotlight recently) didn’t start having any issues until basically a year after the processor was released. That leads me to assume that they may have released a buggy update of some sort for their motherboards.",Neutral
AMD,"I barely see any CPU killed by MSI or Gigabytes this gen. Also, I don't believe Asrock sells more than those two. In most of countries Asrock aren't even an option.",Negative
AMD,">They do offer more features  I think this might be the cause. My asrock board has *way* more options than I've ever seen on a motherboard before. I've had it for a year and a half now and still don't know what a lot of them do. It makes me wonder if people are messing with options they don't understand, which is actually frying things.  my system: asrock x670e taichi, amd ryzen 9 7950xt, amd asrock rx 6950xt. it's been great so far, only a single issue having to do with resuming from sleep with a keyboard.

AMD,"Sure, show us the data to support your claim.",Neutral
AMD,"Only the Asrock subreddit has a dedicated mega thread for these failures, which could make the issue seem bigger than it is in reality. Ryzen CPUs have died on other motherboards vendors as well, so I think that this issue is AMD’s fault.",Negative

AMD,"I'm very hopeful for Intel on this gen and Nova Lake I'm very excited about.    Intel in benchmarks though was always hit or miss due to cache issues and lack of avx 512. Canned benchmarks they did good on, but a lot of apps were starting to get avx512 optimized more and they would lose HARD there. Not only that but there were certain games where it was just catastrophic, and not due to windows e core issues.    Look at Homeworld 3 CPU benchmarks (I know it sucks).",Positive

AMD,Intel's been down this road before. It's not worth it. 14900HX is the only reminder you need. How fast does it need to be before we start talking about just putting a GPU in? If I'm getting a laptop why would I get a power hog collapsing star? It's called mITX.,Negative
AMD,Spinning a delay of building a competitor into this? Good try,Negative
AMD,"To completely compete with Strix Halo (really just the graphics side) would require intel to increase the die size just like AMD did. In practice, even in gaming, it isn't worth it. Yes, you get between 20-30% more performance with Strix Halo up to 65W, and then pushing 80w+ Strix Halo opens up further to closer to 40-50% better performance. Thing is, it just doesn't make sense to create a large APU with those power requirements for full performance in today's market... especially at the prices of Strix Halo products. You can just get a solution with a dGPU at those prices.  I just wish Intel would push for Linux compatibility. Panther Lake is being held back by the suck that is current Windows 11 imo.",Negative
AMD,"Hmm, that's a shame.  I really like Strix Halo.  They're niche, no doubt, but with NVIDIA having DGX Spark, and AMD releasing a ""competitor"" later this year, kind of surprised Intel is going to ignore the compact AI development market.",Negative
AMD,"From what I've seen today on reviews, they really trade blows at different TDP ranges. I'm yet to see benchmarks that come out with the 70 something percent gains Intel claimed.",Neutral
AMD,"LPDDR tends to be more power efficient than GDDR, especially when shared with the CPU. Not to mention you lose less power to communication. In other words, an iGPU will always be more power efficient than a dGPU.",Positive
AMD,It still might not be a competitor because it's going to be expensive as hell. If one wants the bleeding edge chip they have to fork it out.,Negative
AMD,The 70% claim is against Strix Point which is the similarly sized offering from AMD. It only trades blows with Strix Halo because that's a far larger (and expensive to manufacture) chip whose gpu portion is as large as a desktop RX 7700. More cores at lower clocks means better efficiency.,Neutral
AMD,iGPU?,Neutral
AMD,"It’ll use less power, and it’ll do less work per watt too.",Neutral
AMD,"By ""this"" I meant the quote. As much as Pantherlake is great, I don't believe they were able to pull an AX launch off in time but simply didn't",Negative
AMD,It only trades blows at low power. Once you get higher wattages in it does not. But efficiency wise I think id trade my strip halo for an extra hour or battery gaming even with the lesser performance as I won't feel it much in the type of games I play. Panther Lake is a strategy gamers dream chip. Thin and light that can play the games at 1080p for 3 hours on battery.,Neutral
AMD,This is more based on die size than work per watt.,Neutral
AMD,Nah,Positive

AMD,"Seems like it got deleted, don't know why.",Negative
AMD,"Unless you want better battery life, reliable wake from sleep, better cpu and multi-core perf.   Apple proved you don't have to be gaming first to be successful.

AMD,"The node helps, obviously, but you still need to design a product that works. The choice of node is not a magical solution.  Arrow Lake had flaws that showed themselves in certain workloads due to design. They \*did\* still get an overall efficiency boost but thats not a high bar given what they were coming from.",Neutral
AMD,"Intel 7 was competitive in peak performance, but lacked efficiency. Also note that arrowlake utilized N3b which was notorious for poor yield and over complexity and quickly replaced with N3e in Apples line of products. Arrowlake also followed the 13th/14th gen debacle and Intel reduced ring bus clocks significantly to play it safe.  Most notably, going from a monolithic design to chiplets leads to increased latency which reduces gaming performance and makes it harder to hold higher clock speeds. Monolothic designs will always be faster in a 1:1 comparison but chiplets make up for it by being modular and cheaper to scale, something intel hasnt been able to really take advantage of until Pantherlake.",Negative
AMD,"They were experimenting with tiles and it’s an early iteration. Not to mention they have more experience with their own fab.   Arrow lake smokes 14th gen in compiler workloads.

AMD,Not really. It loses against the 288v in the first test and wins against in the second test.  There is no direct comparison against the Ryzen 7 350 and I don't know how you even reached the conclusion that the Ryzen 7 350 is more efficient than lunar lake?

The Ryzen 7 350 is actually included in their list and ranks dead last in the multicore comparison so there's that and in the single core comparison Lunar Lake generally performs better than both but once again the Ryzen 7 350 is beaten by panther lake.  They even include a nice graph for different PL which also happens to include the Ryzen 7 PRO 350.,Neutral
AMD,"You are discussing SKUs. The reason lower stack PTL has fewer Xe cores is because they are nearly 2x efficiency.   However, should you take a higher SKU and configure TDP to 20W (or even 15W to account for external memory) it will be more efficient than Lunar. Lunar Lake is great, but PTL is much better.",Neutral
AMD,You'll see but not even in your wettest dreams the Ryzen will be beaten. Intel remains Intel after all.,Neutral
AMD,"It needs to be at least 2x as efficient to be as powerful because it has HALF as many cores. It isn't, therefore the GPU will be weaker. You can do that same TDP configuration on Lunar Lake. Not sure why that matters.  ""Nearly 2x more efficient"" translates to ""nearly as powerful"". But not quite.",Neutral
AMD,It is 70% faster. You’re comparing different SKUs. Compare top Lunar Lake to top Panther. How the TDP is configured is up to the OEM,Neutral
AMD,"We don't know how efficient those 28W Panther Lake chips run at 17W. Just because you can run it at such low power does not mean it will work well. It will certainly be much less efficient if it were to be run that way otherwise Intel would be gloating at how powerful and efficient their Panther Lake GPU is at 17W. The fact that they don't means it is well below their sweet spot of efficiency. You are basically starving it, similar to stalling an engine.",Negative
AMD,"The fact that it can even compare to AMDs halo product, which the avg consumer can’t afford is a win for Intel. Intel has plenty on leg room to expand the GPU too.",Positive
AMD,This suffers from bandwidth bottleneck. Strix halo is Quad channel while panther lake is dual. An igpu would benifit greatly with a quad channel,Negative
AMD,"This thing is absolutely nuts  AMD BTFO unironically, I'm floored. I never, ever would have considered an Intel chip before 2025, now this is the most obvious laptop part ever. AMD is surely sorely regretting recycling the same 780M and 890M chips for another entire gen, betting that Intel would continue stagnating.  This thing is gonna be a monster in handhelds.  I really, really wanted a Strix Halo laptop, but the lack of SKUs, price and the inflexibility with RAM kind of make it unappealing to say the least, not to mention the power draw compared to Panther Lake is unwelcome. These laptops are gonna be probably the best x86 in mobile has eaten in a very long time.  On top of that, it's almost making the 5050 look like a stupid part in a laptop.

The ultra H 300 has default TDP of 25W, with Maximum Turbo Power (MTP) going up to 65W-80W.

AMD,"Bingo  Strix is also limited by being RDNA 3.5 and no FSR4, so it's rather dependent on raw throughput, and it can't possibly fit in a comfortable handheld that would last for more than an hour and a half under load.  I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage.

AMD,">GPU's will take all the bandwidth you can feed them.   Didn't deny that. But 12 Xe cores is presumably considered the sweet spot, that's all I'm saying. And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.  Besides, Intel already has Nova Lake AX in the backlog, or whatever it's going to be called. Practically intel's strix halo. It'll have Xe3P cores, more powerful than Xe3, thus deemed more worthy of the halo treatment.",Neutral

But all I need to know is it's faaar bigger.  >panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus  That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.",Neutral
AMD,"Well Panther uses mixed processes, and hybrid tiles are bound to be a bit less space efficient than putting everything on a single die.

Case and point, AMD's R9 Fury X. Released with 4096bit bus HBM. Had a total memory bandwidth of 512GB/s. Yet the GTX 980 Ti released with a 384bit bus and 336GB/s memory bandwidth and it out performed the Fury X in pretty much everything.

AMD,"Check the Just Josh interview! Dude criticizes exactly that to an intel executive... For me, they should drop the ultra naming scheme altogether... it hasn't stuck yet... they should go back to de i3/i5/i7/i9...use the X for the B390... and an S for the 16 core variants...",Negative
AMD,Apple always nails the small stuff,Positive
AMD,"Just because it sounds similar to Apple does not make it ""bad"".  I chose ""S3"" because they literally market them as ""Series 3"" (sounds awfully similar to M-series 🤨). Could fiddle with it but my idea stands:  Different core count = different name, Better gpu = add X",Neutral
AMD,"Nope, its the Ultra 5 338H: [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/245531/intel-core-ultra-5-processor-338h-18m-cache-up-to-4-70-ghz/specifications.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/245531/intel-core-ultra-5-processor-338h-18m-cache-up-to-4-70-ghz/specifications.html)  The Ultra X7 and X9 are listed as such on Ark: [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/series/245528/intel-core-ultra-series-3-processors.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/series/245528/intel-core-ultra-series-3-processors.html)",Neutral

Cause they can market the 338H to you, and then sell you the 336H at a fraction of the cost, and if you are not very tech-savvy, well, that's too bad for you.",Positive
AMD,"Yes because PC manufacturers want a ""choice"" to get a CPU with 100MHz higher clock speed as if that will make a difference in a mobile device at all.

AMD,"I see, that does complicate things.",Negative
AMD,Why are you getting downvoted 😭  For consumer products it makes complete sense to go for more simplistic naming schemes,Negative
AMD,"It still should have the X IMO. They're still bothering to call it a B3xx chip rather than just ""Intel Graphics"" like the <=4 Xe chips. The handheld chips running downclocked GPUs get the B360 and B380 names as well. Those should all be Core Ultra X.  As of right now only the ending 8 differentiates the 338H from the small-GPU SKUs, which IMO is not clear enough. Also, if the X became the standard for all big-GPU chips, that ending digit can be used for something else, such as noting the actual GPU performance within the stack. Perhaps just using the 6-9 from B360-390 or something like that.",Neutral
AMD,"You are placing way more importance into the naming than any normal customer would.  The names that matter to normal customers are Core Ultra 5, Core Ultra 7, Core Ultra X7, which is what you will also find on the stickers that Intel has the PC manufacturers put on the device. The model numbers are just for the PC manufacturers and customers who want the exact SKU.  Seriously, your obsession with this is weird. Just accept that the naming is not meant for you and move on. Not everything has to be like Apple.  > If you think ""vPro"" is so important, processors with it should have entirely unique names.

AMD,">We need to stop looking at the Core Ultra 9 285K through the lens of a typical generational refresh  That's all what consumers care about. They don't care if ARL on paper or on theory is some great reset. Perf, power, and cost is what's important.   >he 285K is suffering from the acute growing pains of decoupling the compute complex from the uncore in a way that creates a distinct latency penalty that enthusiasts are mistaking for regression.  It's not being ""mistaken"" for a regression, it quite literally is one.   The problem is also that AMD also has disaggregated their compute from their IMC, and yet has *better* latency on *less advanced* packaging.   >The controversy here isn't that Intel failed to push frequency; it is that they deliberately chose to execute a hard pivot away from the monolithic brute force strategy of Raptor Lake to a disaggregated chiplet design that prioritizes area efficiency and performance-per-watt over raw, latency-sensitive throughput.  Nothing about ARL's current design prioritizes ppw or area efficiency over RPL's design from a chiplets vs monolithic perspective. ARL isn't enabling higher core counts from going chiplets, that seems to be left to NVL according to rumors. And chiplets carries an area penalty over monolithic designs anyway.   >The removal of Hyper-Threading from the Lion Cove P-cores is the most contentious yet logically sound decision engineers could have made given the thermal constraints of modern silicon.   This makes no sense   >By removing the simultaneous multithreading logic, specifically the duplication of architectural state and the complexity required in the reorder buffers and schedulers to handle two threads, Intel was able to physically widen the core and increase the L2 cache per core to 3MB without blowing up the die size  SMT costs Zen 5 less than 5% in area btw. Just throwing that out there.   >The result is a P-core with significantly higher IPC than Raptor Cove  It's not though. This has been a significantly worse ""tock"" in terms of IPC uplift compared to something like SNC or GLC.   >but this raw single-threaded throughput is being masked by the interconnect latency.  Maybe gaming or some benchmarks are, but for the large part, no.   You can see this two ways, LNC's structural gains (core width, ROB capacity, etc etc) have smaller gains, percentage wise, over their predecessor versus something you would see in GLC vs SNC, or SNC vs SKL.  And also LNL's uncore is dramatically improved over ARL, and yet you see the same unimpressive IPC gains over MTL/RWC (which is the basis for ARL's mid mem fabric).   >the architectural overhead of the Foveros packaging means that ring bus latency is higher.

AMD,Designing a consumer product line around the niche of top of the line workstation is not a good decision for the average consumer.  I only once met a person with video production workstation that has more than an I7 or R7.  Previous gen I5 were amazing combo of multi core and single core . They rivaled amd r7 in preformance . Now a person wanting mid level cpu's would pay preformance tax due to it being made for the few people needing extreme amount of cores since those people would not buy dies that actually were designed for it like Xeon.,Negative
AMD,"this is a lot of words, being honest this writing feels like ai (but in good sense, right to point without a bunch of bs)   i would agree this architecture is very much limited by d2d and without 200s or just pushing d2d can be kinda underwhelming in performance but for sure as first gen product is very solid and makes me personally excited for nova lake as it seems they plan to fix and improve on their current architecture  also i believe clockspeed difference was merely responsible to 13/14th gen failures which were caused by excessive idle voltage.  i would say adding DLVR was kinda smart as well as it reduces your power consumption significantly at idle especially with proper tuning.

AMD,"AMD had a very similar experience with their first generation of Ryzen CPUs. One of the differences here is Intel had a competitive product prior to their architectural shakeup. Had Intel totally croaked for years and not been competitive in the CPU space the narrative would be completely different and everyone would be singing their praises.  Aside from that I think the biggest problem with this new architecture is simply there's little reason to buy in. It was only recently (if memory serves, I could be wrong on this) announced that the next generation of CPUs will share this platform and later ones will be on a new socket. When AM4 was announced we knew that it would persist for multiple generations and now with AM5 - why would you buy a board that will be obsolete when its time to upgrade when you could buy into a platform that will support your next 1-2 CPUs? Especially with the old intel socket performing just as well on a more mature platform, for most end users this first core ultra series just isn't worth investing.",Neutral

AMD,"IMO corrupt tech sites and tech YouTubers are behind ARL’s failure for two reasons.   The first: AMD MCM processors without 3D cache are bad for gaming, and it’s hard to find this information in 90% of charts to warn intel about the consequences of going down this path, even though they should have done their own tests and experiments.   The second: in my own tests, the 265K was 15% faster than the 9700X on launch BIOS. Through BIOS updates, that gap extended to 20%, making it only 7%-10% slower than the 14700K. Yet on some very questionable charts, the 265K is shown as slower than the 9700X.   For experienced users, RPL CPUs’ temperatures can be lowered by 20°C by turning Hyper-Threading off and undervolting. For inexperienced users, ARL is better, as it runs 20°C cooler out of the box.   I believe that in 2026 we deserve raw, unedited video benchmarks that start from the desktop, show full system specs, then enter game-by-game benchmarking—no more charts with zero evidence to back them up.   When I tried to confront HUB with my benchmarks, I got blocked to cover up their lies and corruption. If they truly cared about which CPU is faster, they would share their in-game benchmark scores and discuss them in a scientific way, but that’s not their goal. The numbers go up and down for the highest bidders.   Lastly, I believe Nova Lake, with its expected 144 MB cache, will be faster than Zen 6 X3D by 10–20% as 9700x in real world is 20% slower than 265k and if both got the same IPC uplift NL will end up on top.

I will go with Intel because of reliability (I know about chip degradation) but for me I bought 13900K from first day I undervolted using offset and but Max turbo frequency to 5.5Ghz . so my chip never tried to boost 5.9Ghz with crazy voltage.  Next is the most important is Everything just works. The boot is faster. wakes from sleep. its a more mature. I have another amd pc with r5 2600, where I found some stability issue.

AMD,"285K seems to have fantastic workstation performance, I didn't think much before selecting Intel over AMD parts for work to be honest, considering the efficiency gains. We landed on 265K, it benches very favorably compared to AM5 parts in nearly every workload except for gaming, and even then, that's mostly the X3D parts, and even then, that's when there is virtually no GPU bottleneck.   Most initial ""gaming"" reviews were done exclusively with 5090s, which is extremely unrealistic for most gamers and gave an extremely false impression that you would see a massive uplift by buying this part compared with the alternative CPU parts in gaming.   A lot of reviewers such as HUB have done a lot of work to correct this impression with a variety of testing scenarios and explaining their reasoning behind removing the GPU limiting factor as much as possible in benchmarks. Incidentally, these reviews typically showed that anything less than a 5080 sees virtually no benefit with a 9800X3D versus, say, a 9700X, and incidentally the two parts that saw no discernible benefits were the Radeon 9070XT and the 9070.  Obviously, if you have a 5090 and an unlimited budget with price being no factor, your best bet for top tier performance in all categories is a 9950X3D, but that just isn't what most people are looking at.  I myself bought into the future proofing mentality with my CPU and bought a 9800X3D, and ironically bought another AMD Radeon 9070XT to pair it with, a GPU that seems literally no performance gain compared to a 9700X, let alone a 285K. The same 285K that takes a dump all over the 9800X3D in nearly every other productivity benchmark.  I guess the good news is that when I upgrade my GPU in 2-4 years, at least I'll take advantage of the 9800X3D in games, lol. But considering it cost me over $900 for CPU, RAM, and motherboard, that's cold comfort.

MTL releasing in Dec 2023, internal testing I'm sure yielding some set of data, and external reviews giving other feedback, even by the release of MTL, ARL has probably been in the pipeline for years and probably locked into certain design choices regardless of the feedback and testing.  Additionally I suspect that on mobile chips/laptop gaming rigs there's less focus on each individual part because  a) few people hardcore game on laptops b) the latency can be blamed on other things since laptops are a prepackaged consortium of parts and it's harder to isolate, and  c) therefore laptops tend to be evaluated as a whole rather than the individual pieces that comprise them.   Therefore the ""latency issues"" only became a massive kerfuffle when the offending cpu could be isolated and tested alone, and reviewers needed something to complain about.   That's even if Intel was considering latency as the issue everyone made it out to be. Intel could have looked at it and considered the latency worth the cost to improve in other areas and serve as intels seminal desktop entry utilizing disaggregated silicon. Then gamers came and lost their shit that the newest Intel chip deprioritized something that impacted their precious fps- even though the impact was ""the new one is approximately the same to maybe a little worse as last gen in most games"".   Notwithstanding the fact that the 200 series chips retain healthy gen-to-gen perf uplift and a _massive efficiency improvement_ in productivity and general computing, and boosting the NGU and D2D clocks (which are _very_ low from the factory, and can be done with the app that Intel _has specifically designed for tuning their chips_ and is freely available (XTU)) brings the gaming performance to ""approximately the same to a little better in most games"". Contrary to what some people may think these chips are not solely or even majority used for gaming and there are other use cases Intel can to think about/chose to prioritize.   To be fair, gamers and tech enthusiasts are the ones who will care the most and therefore have a disproportionately large impact on the kind of publicity the chip will get. So, was this intels smartest PR decision? Maybe not. But I think it was still a sound engineering decision, regardless of whether or not they had feedback or data on the issue, even if it didn't go over very well with their loudest customer base.  And this is all overshadowed by the fact that if you stuck even the most hardcore of gamers on a blind trial and told them to identify what kind of chip they were gaming on, I have a hard time believing any of them would be able to tell with any certainty which is which.   Once you get to 60 fps, the vast majority of people stop caring. Whats five fps going to do to radically change your gaming experience so much that it's unplayable? Which brings me back to one of my original points: If you care _that much_, you can go spend your money _elsewhere_.",Neutral

AMD,"Let me explain why it will not degrade my CPU.  1. **TVB (Thermal Velocity Boost) is disabled when I set the turbo limit.** 2. **Current is not the issue.** First, even Intel chips were failing at idle. Second, you stated that ""the same power limit at lower voltage necessarily means more current."" That is incorrect, if it drew more current, then why does lowering voltage reduce power consumption? Have you missed basic physics? 3. **CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve.** The main issue was that either the CPU or the motherboard was supplying excessive voltage, or the CPU was requesting too much. Higher voltage is required for extreme single-core boosts, such as 5.9 GHz. This is why i3 and i5 CPUs were not affected. When I limit my boost and apply an undervolt, the CPU no longer requests high voltage. It might request slightly higher voltage for 5.5 GHz, but that is nowhere near the voltage required for a 5.9 GHz boost. 4. **The same principle applies.**  Its seems you are a failure of high life form.

To be very clear, as this is personal for you, I do own Intel equipment including an Arc graphics setup for one of my children. I'm not anti-Intel or anti-American at all.   I know the history between AMD and Intel fairly well. Oversimplifying, AMD as it is doesn't exist without Intel. AMD only grew because they were the most successful second source producer for Intel, and the most successful at riding the thin grey line between patient infringement and unique implementation of similar IP that kept them alive while everyone else in the X86 space either died or became irrelevant to the consumer or enterprise space. After Itanium, the story levels out with both companies becoming effectively unwilling AMD64 codependents, and I'm saying that humorously.   Intel would gladly own the X86 market outright. So would AMD. At the end of the day, we need the two driving innovation through competition.

Broadwell-E and early Skylake also weren’t great for OC.   -Once the node matured, things improved again. Coffee Lake (refined 14nm) made 5 GHz relatively easy. The same pattern repeats with 10nm: Alder Lake (12th gen) came after Tiger Lake and could already reach ~5 GHz, while Raptor Lake pushed clocks even higher, up to ~5.7 GHz.

As I said in a separate post:  ""It's so strange to me that we've hit a spot in consumer and enterprise computing where politics is now a factor (speaking about how decisions beyond national security are now driven by politics and trying to be on the right side at any moment when it matters). It's a different game when companies have to worry about that side, far too many consumers make decisions based on their politics when all that does is cause other issues. Obviously I won't go farther than that in a tech focused discussion lol, but I will say again that it's a different game and I don't think anyone wins if it becomes the norm.""  I'm going to add, light heartedly, I do hope we see AMD/nVidia/Qualcomm/etc manufactured and final packaged products coming out of Intel Foundries one day. I'm not sure how or if it will work, but the situation seems dead set not to allow significant further nodes beyond 2 nm or packaging to occur outside of North America. If the US wants viable national chip production, Intel is the better option, I hope it works out in a way that maintains design level competition while meeting national security goals.",Neutral

AMD,"u/Chelostyles Thank you for your inquiry regarding the CPU and RAM upgrade for your Dell Vostro 3670. As much as I'd like to provide my technical insights on this upgrade path, I'm not in a position to provide specific suggestions since this involves hardware modifications to an OEM system.  For the best compatibility outcome and to ensure optimal system performance, I strongly recommend reaching out to your system manufacturer directly. They can provide definitive guidance on supported CPU upgrades (i5-8400 to i7-9700) and maximum RAM configurations for your specific model. We don't want to inadvertently bypass any warranty terms and conditions on your system by providing modification recommendations that might affect your coverage.  Your system manufacturer's technical support team will have access to the exact specifications, BIOS compatibility matrices, and supported hardware configurations for your Vostro 3670 model. They can confirm whether the motherboard supports the i7-9700, the maximum RAM capacity (64GB vs 128GB), and any potential limitations or requirements for these upgrades.  This approach ensures you get accurate, manufacturer-validated information while maintaining your system's warranty protection.",Neutral
AMD,"u/I_like_carsyay  XPS 15 9530 hardware does support Resizable BAR, which is why Intel's system detection shows it as available for both your Arc A370M and Iris Xe graphics.

This approach ensures optimal system performance while reducing complexity for users. I recommend checking for the latest BIOS updates from your OEM's support site and contacting their technical support team, as they would have the most current information about how ReBAR is implemented on your specific model and whether any additional configuration steps are needed to fully utilize this feature.     I've posted an article below in case you haven't yet come across it:  **Helpful Resources:**  *  [What Is Resizable BAR and How Do I Enable It?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090831/graphics.html)",Neutral

AMD,"I used to run my i3-540 at 4.2GHz, air cooled on what is effectively worse than a Hyper 212 Evo. I miss the old days when I could overclock the snot out of them. These days I guess they're binned to almost their max potential out of the factory so most of the time I'm undervolting them.",Negative
AMD,Well done. Still using two H55m machines with OC (x3450 and i5 661).  They also OC decently at stock voltage keeping turbo and all power savings. My X3450 does 2.6 -> 3.3Ghz(3.8 turbo). The advantage is that it idles quite low at 50-60W.   But for gaming and rendering it's better to go all in as you did. Most chips can do anywhere from 3.8 to 4.2 all cores IME.,Positive
AMD,nah my 40 logical processors would smash through it all  x2 xeon e5-2680 v2,Neutral
AMD,"is that better? I dont need to dive into setting anymore, the CPU maker do it for me with warranty.",Neutral
AMD,"There is still more to work with, especially if one does not fossilize on static all core OC, but does 2-step TVB fueled dynamic OC, Ecores are Aldo the source of much happiness on arrow",Positive
AMD,I miss overclocking. Felt like you were getting a bargain. Now I don’t even try.,Negative
AMD,"Not as big an OC as yours, but I had a pre-built from FutureShop.  It was their home brand name.  Found a BIOS for the board that wasn’t theirs.  Managed to get 3.2GHz out of a 2.4GHz Pentium 4 on pre-built from FutureShop cooling.",Neutral
AMD,"Wow, soo cool",Positive
AMD,The motherboard doesn't accept other stick of ram. Only my corsair ram work,Negative
AMD,How did you even get a 6950x to boot at 5.2ghz? Most of them hit a wall around 4.3ghz,Negative
AMD,"Has its ups and downs. Now that I'm older and have less time to tweak things and mostly just want shit to be stable, I see ""pre-overclocked with maybe 5% performance left on the table"" as a pro. The con is that chipmakers just jam a ton of power through it to make it happen, and the option of buying a half-price chip and spending an entire sleepless weekend tweaking it yourself to get 95% of the more expensive chip's performance is gone.",Negative
AMD,"Same - the complexity and heat rose a lot and the gains because less significant - with multi-core chips and turbo frequencies there just isn't much headroom in them.  That and I work fixing issues with computers all day, I just want my own PC to work.",Negative
AMD,"Thats because these older CPUs were surprisingly energy efficient. Also mostly because now modern CPUs are powerful enough where overclocking is pointless. Even my i3-12100 being overclocked would be pointless, even if its only a 80 watt CPU",Negative
AMD,He couldn't without LN2.,Neutral
AMD,"It was short lived, over ~7 years I had to pull back the multiplier from 52 to 44 to keep it stable.  I retired the system this year.  It was a full open loop from EK.  2x Pascal Titan X in SLi",Neutral
AMD,"I used to overclock everything, now I undervolt everything lol",Neutral
AMD,"The most important characteristics of a laptop are battery life ( power efficiency) and screen quality. That is what sells ( non apple ) clamshells.    All the other crap they test in various reviews are mostly meaningless to the actual user. There is a very small %age of the market for high power/perf laptops and even smaller market for gaming.   Most of the reason a laptop is “slow” is bloatware and has nothing to do with the cpu choice anyway.  And Intel is already “beating” AMD in laptop cpu sales, by a substantial margin. People incorrectly assume AMD has most of the market share in all segments because of the very noisy and super-biased gaming reviewers, who mostly focus on $3000+ gaming desktop builds. Yes AMD is handily winning there.",Neutral
AMD,"I have a T14s Gen 5 Core Ultra 5 135U and recently I saw \~9h of battery life, browsing websites. It's quite nice piece of hardware so with Lunar Lake it would be just perfect. Of course not for heavy workload because for this we will have Panther Lake. I work in tech for years, not an expert in laptops area but I can assure you that new CPUs from Intel that I mentioned earlier are way, way, way better than previous generations.",Positive
AMD,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works. It's like the 2001 Toyota of the laptop world, it's not winning prizes for looks, but it'll never die, gets good mileage (battery life), and is easily repairable. Maybe not the laptop you want, but definitely the one you need (excluding people who need something like a dedicated GPU or really need super high CPU performance).",Positive
AMD,"Intel beats AMD in software (drivers, firmware) … I got think pad 780M laptop by company I work for. Randomly display won’t get detected. Randomly audio device goes missing. Not fun thing to reboot your laptop and miss 10 minutes of meeting.",Negative
AMD,"Soldered RAM sucks.  Nothing beats popping out the standard 8GB stick(s) a notebook may come with, installing a couple 2x32GB sticks yourself and having it actually work.",Negative
AMD,lol. Even in the cons it says weaker multicore than AMD….?   This article seems like AI wrote it,Negative
AMD,"Unfortunately Intel abandoned the on-package RAM after Lunar Lake again, which is the primary reason for the great efficiency and low power usage. I kind of understand why, it's expensive and not very flexible, plus apparently the market doesn't actually care that much about long battery runtimes. Only a small minority of people are ready to pay premium for this.",Negative
AMD,At work we are a Lenovo shop and recently swapped from Intel to AMD T14 laptops. Too many issues with Intel and the AMD models offer the same performance for less money.,Negative
AMD,Suck at gaming.,Negative
AMD,Try a modern mac and tell me its not the CPU holding the UX back. It's all about the cpu's.,Neutral
AMD,"That would be nice. We have a bunch of laptops with Intel's i5, 13th gen I believe it was. 2 p-cores, some e-cores. They are all slow as fuck. I mean it. The CPU is so extremely slow and goes into tdp limit right away. Most users hate them.  Battery life is ok, but they are really bad in terms of performance.  So - I wouldn't say CPU doesn't matter.",Negative
AMD,"AMD is held back in laptops by some shady deals of laptop manufacturers with Intel. It's impossible to get a 4k AMD laptop with 5090 for example, all of those are Intel (I found literally one AMD laptop like that compared to 25 from Intel). That's utterly ridiculous.",Negative
AMD,Isn’t the keyboard one of the most important characteristics?,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, so much of laptop performance is dictated by things other than the cpu. Its kinda wild.   Intel does a way better job getting good laptop designs. Amd historically has just been a cpu seller, telling oems to go wild and do whatever . . . And it always ends very badly.   The biggest sign amd is taking share is not cpu benchmarks, but will be things like having premium screens, good thermals, lack of bloatware, dual channel memory, good SSDs, good colors, etc etc. and . . . ACTUAL AVAILABILITY. I dunno how many reviews i see where they review and intel and amd parts. Usually there is some way intel has a better premium finish. And then amd just has zero ways to actually buy their model. Its the weirdest thing.",Negative
AMD,"Hey I’m looking at the exact same laptop that you have. Can you tell me about the build quality and if there’s any keyboard flex when pressing down on it? Please tell me. I’m going to use it for word, excel, reading lots of pdf files and ebooks and watch movies. Will it be enough for that?",Neutral
AMD,Omg a positive review for Intel Lunar Lake 😭  https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/s/RYInPJfnAd,Positive
AMD,"But haven't you heard, AMD beats Nvidia slightly at linux gaming benchmarks.  That means AMD has the best software support.",Positive
AMD,"I miss the times when laptops were far more upgradeable. I got a budget laptop for college with a low-end dual core, a spinning HDD, and 1 stick of 2GB RAM. By the time I retired it ~6 years later I've upgraded the CPU, replaced the HDD with a SSD, and added 2x4GB sticks of RAM. I also could've swapped out the network card and even the DVD drive for another SATA drive, but never got around to those.",Neutral
AMD,Soldered ram is a lot faster. So no.,Neutral
AMD,Yes but now RAM costs a ton of money,Negative
AMD,Is multicore performance the only consideration when buying a laptop?,Neutral
AMD,What kind of issues?,Neutral
AMD,What kind of issues with Intel? I thought it was the AMD that had tons of issues,Negative
AMD,It is not a gaming laptop,Neutral
AMD,"Yep. More specifically, it's mostly the single thread performance and efficiency.  It's how a MacBook Air can be fanless, run super fast, and stay cool at the same time while you're doing work with it.",Positive
AMD,It's an enterprise grade product you buffoon.,Negative
AMD,Exactly. Thinkpads are not targeting average Joes. They are targeting business and enterprise customers. Their Yoga and Ideapads are targeting the regular Joes.,Neutral
AMD,Build quality.    Thinkpads are solid machines that are easy to fix.    It's one of the few laptops that comes close to MacBook quality and everything judt working.,Positive
AMD,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good. It seems the Intel chip was designed to be very efficient during periods of downtime and something like viewing a PDF or editing a document has a LOT of downtime for the CPU",Positive
AMD,"Because only on Linux, Valve heavily funds AMD driver development and they also get other community contributions. The commonly used RADV vulkan driver was started as a community effort without AMD involvement.",Neutral
AMD,"I hope you're joking(sorry if you are), cos Nvidia isn't actually a good benchmark for software support on Linux. Intel is so much better at Linux software support than Nvidia",Negative
AMD,"The question is, is the soldered ram you're buying in a laptop faster than the ram you can buy and install yourself?",Neutral
AMD,All the more reason to make it upgradable,Positive
AMD,Lunar Lake isn’t how Intel beats Amd lol. Panther lake will stop a lot of the bleeding for sure. AMD is so far making mostly good moves and Intel is as well with LBT. The goal for Intel over the next 3 years is stop losing customers base. I will point out Intel still has about 75% of all x86 customers.,Neutral
AMD,"I mean, the only other pro is, that you cannot get the 2.8K panel on the AMD version for some reason..... sooo",Negative
AMD,This was back when the 14th generation were having issues.,Negative
AMD,"It's $2,000 so no excuse.",Neutral
AMD,Thank you so much for this valuable and comprehensive information! I really appreciate it:),Positive
AMD,"Usually yes, soldered ram will be faster. And in case of lunar lake, it is faster and more efficient due to it being packaged with the cpu. Like Apple's unified memory.",Positive
AMD,"Lunar Lake already beat AMD, nobody buys AMD laptops",Neutral
AMD,i stopped at $2100 for a Thinkpad T14,Neutral
AMD,"Ah okay, got it thanks.",Positive
AMD,Panther Lake fixed it,Neutral
AMD,wrong  Nobody Supply AMD laptop     There fixed for u,Negative
AMD,"I do, and many of the people I know do.",Neutral
AMD,Nobody pays that much.,Negative
AMD,"Not anymore, there are plenty of AMD laptops on the market, of course - depending on region.",Neutral
AMD,Try the shunt mod,Neutral
AMD,"Cool, errr...  icy",Neutral
AMD,"I used to work in an inter chip testing lab in Ronler Acres Beaverton. We would test them in an oven, test them at room temp, and test the chips with liquid nitrogen. Cold had the highest failure rate, hot had the highest success rate.  Chips are designed to love heat.",Neutral
AMD,Great work man. Brings back the memories from the good 'ol early 2000's.   You need a power mod and more voltage.,Positive
AMD,"mine with B570, everything stock, no any mod   [https://imgur.com/a/i5wVgi4](https://imgur.com/a/i5wVgi4)",Neutral
AMD,did you use dry ice? how did you hit sub-ambient?,Neutral
AMD,I ordered a steel legend B580 and I’m going to clamp an LN2 pot to it and run it on Dice to see what happens. Probably going to shunt mod it as well because of what you did. Might as well add an Intel card to my mix and see what it does.,Neutral
AMD,Are you in the US? If so how were you able to get Maxsun?,Neutral
AMD,Oh... for sure 😁,Positive
AMD,"I know! If I could of modded the power table I would have, shunt mod is on the ""card"" for sure.",Positive
AMD,Great work dude! Only 200MHz to go 😉,Positive
AMD,Car coolant in the freezer 😁,Positive
AMD,That's the way! Let us all know the results.,Positive
AMD,I am in Australia.,Neutral
AMD,I di it myself but it seemed to only add like 20% more power not really the unlimited I expected.,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, but car coolant doesn't enable sub-zero. What else did you have in the freezer, how was the liquid cooled?",Neutral
AMD,Should be here in a few days and I’ll tear it down and prep it. I’ll see how it goes when it’s down to -70c and do some scores and then shunt it. I think it can probably handle 30% more wattage just fine. My HWBOT is Forsaken7. I’ll let you know.,Positive
AMD,So do you have outlets in Australia where you can buy Maxsun Gpus?  Does Maxsun have an outlet in Australia where you can RMA to?  I am in the US and I want to look into getting the dual Arc card with 48gb of vram.,Neutral
AMD,"Okay, household freezers get to -18C. Water freezes at 0C, antifreeze freezes at about -25C. So, car coolant in a freezer will get to and hold -18C while staying liquid. So, that's how I did it.",Neutral
AMD,"Just be aware (from my experience anyway) when Intel crashes it doesn't just crash the driver, it crashes into a full reboot, almost every time. It's a real effing pain in the arse.",Negative
AMD,Oh! You put the car coolant to run through a freezer? Wow! Nice,Positive
