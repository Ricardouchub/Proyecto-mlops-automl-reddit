Intel,I thought that was Denis lol,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah this is a really surprisingly open factory tour, at least compared to when Sapphire took Linus and Alex along. It feels unprecedented to see this much access and insight, but that's the goodwill nurtured by Steve paying off in spades. The lament about AMD and Nvidia ditching the sub-250 side is real, so having Arc actually be a usable option down here is going to be significant later on.",Negative
Intel,"Pretty good video with a lot of detail I haven't seen in previous factory tours. I probably still won't use an Intel GPU for gaming, but for a media server it's probably sufficient.  Side note: It's funny how whenever a GN video gets posted, the same cast of characters comes out and writes essays criticizing the video, apparently without watching it. I guess that's what it means to ""make it"".",Positive

Intel,That hat is so useful,Positive
Intel,Making them isn't important selling them is.  The reality is that this segment doesn't actually exist it has no buyers in it.  Seems intel is truly doomed trying to win segments that if they even exist aren't big enough to pay back their R&D even if the dominate them.,Negative
Intel,"To be fair this is not a clean room, just SMT assembly. Basically, soldering components. A lose hair might be a bit of a problem (kind of like in any factory), but his hair is tied and doesn't seem to be an issue.

Intel,"It’s crazy. I think Steve and GN are doing the lords work with their nonstop, accurate coverage of the absolute shit state of the computer component markets and the megacorps that perpetuate it.

Probably the same mfs that bought MKBHD’s wallpaper app lmfao",Negative
Intel,"Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket. To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of similar performance or even outperforming the cards in those brackets.

Intel,"They're talking about the A310 and A380, of which Nvidia doesn't have anything made in this decade to compete with and AMD has the 6400 that came out 5 years ago.  The only cards with modern features in that price segment that consumers can directly buy are the A310 and A380.",Neutral
Intel,He(Lucas) stated $100 was the market that was abandoned.  10:37  > Steve: So why still making A310?  > Lucas: Because what's the competitor have? Nvidia? like... GT710? GT1030? (laughs) No way. So literally Nvidia AMD already give up the segment of this like... $100 price card.,Neutral
Intel,This guy was talking about the A310 which is a $100 GPU. Basically said that the only other options at that price bracket are either a GT 710 or a GT 1030. And from AMD you can still get an old RX 550. The A310 may be slow but it beats those two gpu's by a mile.,Neutral

Intel,B580 has 12gb of vram though,Neutral
Intel,"Sad that all of those are 8gb cards. Even if comparable or faster than the B580 aside from that, the lack of vram makes them far inferior products imo.",Negative
Intel,I just wish all of those options were more compelling tbh. I think what Steve was trying to say was that AMD and Nvidia have just half assed that market segment at the expense of the consumer. All these being 8gb cards for $250-$300 is kinda ridiculous in 2026. I’ll take a b580 over a 9060xt 8gb or 5060 any day of the week.,Negative
Intel,Go to r/PCMasterrace and they will downvote you into oblivion for even MENTIONING the possibility of gaming on a 5060 let alone 5050 XD,Neutral
Intel,The title is just playing the YouTube algorithm game. It's stupid but they have to do it.,Negative
Intel,"> Love how 5050 is actually at msrp now cheapest b580 is $349+  Just an FYI but B&H has the [Acer Nitro B580 for $249.99](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1874395-REG/acer_dp_z4bww_p01_nitro_oc_arc_b580.html) and the [Intel Limited Edition model for $259.99](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1869297-REG/intel_31p06hb0ba_arc_b580_limited_edition.html). So you can get B580 for MSRP, but for how long who knows.",Positive
Intel,"die area is not the only cost indicator. B580 actually uses N5 fab, which is likely cheaper than N4, used by 5050. In reality, B580 only has about ~15% more transistors and if we assume N5 is cheaper per transistor and N5 has higher yields (by being more mature) i'd say their die cost might be very similar.  While yes, it has wider memory, the chips are clocked lower, so they can buy slower bins, reducing per chip cost.   B580 has more power draw, which in turn costs more for power delivery and cooling.  All in all, AIB manufacturer likely has lower margin per card as it stands, so i wouldn't be surprised if intel is taking a lower margin on the gpu/gddr combo to get more market share.  Nvidia on the other hand optimized their cost REALLY well, as they have been doing GPUs for almost 30 years.",Neutral
Intel,"Nvidia is getting such good performance out of such a small die because they're the best. Simple as. They've been doing GPU's for decades. It's not unexpected that at this stage Intel needs to use a larger die to match the performance - it would be incredibly surprising if that wasn't the case.  But a small *part* of that die size advantage comes from that narrow 128bit bus, and *part* of B580's appeal is its wider bus and subsequently more VRAM.",Positive
Intel,"I see b580 for € 260. That's VAT included. rtx5050 is similarly priced.     And i found $300 lot on US amazon.  Considering other post, maybe search better than 1 place or something.",Neutral

Intel,I do not know if the numbering scheme from my workplace is common across the industry but the smt assembly would be in a class 5 or 6 clean room and the fabrication itself would be a 1 or 2 class clean room,Neutral
Intel,"I think it still matters to a certain point, thats why everyone in the factory is wearing a hat. The Factory boss decided to roll RNG dice and say *""Fck it, that small hat is fine, even tho wearing it is pointless now; I'll just pray nothing bad happen*"". lol  What hilarious is when you think about what going through uninformed factory-employee's head, after they saw some guy(Steve) walk-into the factory like that. Definitely a lot of ""WTF"" moment going through their mind lmao.",Negative

Intel,This sub is genuinely weird. They complain about PCMR when the level of discourse here is much worse and a lot more mean spirited.,Negative
Intel,"They are truly rage baiting drama mongers sadly. The fact that the causes they support happen to be semi legit and consumer friendly in nature does not take away from the fact that they are essentially drama and negativity for profit at this point, and often out of touch with reality. You can be positive, polite, and have reporting standards while still calling out shitty behavior and ripping bad practices to pieces.   Companies are not your friend. That includes GN. They stoke hardware enthusiast anger for their own gain. Personally i think the harm they do to the space/peoples mentality is farm more than the amount of good most (key word most, fire risks and stuff deserve prompt drama) of their coverage does.   Even this title takes a topic and very educational opportunity to provide actual hardware coverage and immediatly try’s to stoke negative furry about some aspect of the hardware industry. Its just non stop with them. I dont think its healthy for anyone to watch then honestly, which is sad as i used to enjoy their review/news. I hope for their sake they are not actually so perpetually angry and they are doing what they do to knowingly manipulate their audience for increased views/engagement. I cant imagine living life so constantly angry at every possible point over computer hardware, as much as i am saddened by the current state hardware and love gaming.   As tough as it is with rising prices and such and sad to think of what we could have instead, modern hardware, gaming, and such is in a nearly historic good state (realistic cost to perf is probably lowest in history other than brief periods such as the 30 series launch), and is a very cost effective hobby compared with other ones for the time you get out of it. Many great games launch all the time (even if big name traditional games have largely went to trash). They are easier to run with hardware (like the ARC gpu) being quite cheap and capable. People, like GN, need to temper their overexagerated frustration with a dose of real world perspective and objectivity.",Negative
Intel,"Might be just the thing for older machines and a GNU Linux (or BSD like) migration. Or as a pass through GPU to Jellyfin, Emby, or Plex for media transcoding. Edit: or Small form computing tied together with a iGPU enhancing game performance...",Neutral
Intel,yeah there is a reason the a310 cards they are making are 4 hdmi out.  Gotta know your market,Neutral
Intel,I assume those are being marketed to OEMs who make digital billboard systems or something. No idea why else you would want 4 HDMI ports on a card.,Neutral
Intel,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310. Almost anything these days is better than an A310.  >  Like the GT710 make no sense nowadays (their last attempt was what, the GeForce GTX 1630?), even though they sold like hotcakes for offices and for people who just wanted HDMI outs.  GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered. GTX 1630 was okay but it was supposed to be $149 USD MSRP and it came out for like $200 USD in most stores due to GPU shortage at the time, not much NVIDIA could really do about that.",Neutral

Intel,"Compared to my 890M based laptop, the 890M numbers here are about 15-20% lower than what I'm seeing at the same settings.  This is likely due to power targets?  Even if the uplift is just 60% instead of 80%, that's still an impressive achievement for the B390M.  It's a shame that AMD appears to have dropped the iGPU ball in 2026.  Relying on the Strix Halo is not an option here.  It's pretty much impossible to find a good laptops that use it.  The upcoming HX470, and still without FSR4, isn't going to close the apparent large gap.  It seems that AMD forgot to stay hungry and they'll end up losing whatever ground that they'd gained in the last few years.  Mind you, Intel is known to play pressure games with laptop makers too in order to limit AMD adoption, which just makes it even crazier that AMD isn't doing what's required to keep the pressure on.",Negative
Intel,"I think the B390 could be faster than even an RTX 5050 35W (As it could beat an RTX 4050 at 60W).       These thin and light laptops that Panther Lake is built for use way underpowered GPUs. Honestly, it makes sense why the Dell XPS 14 only has the B390 graphics. Before it used an RTX 4050, but it ran at just 30W of power.       Now that Integrated Graphics have beat the -50 Tier of GPUs I don't think we'll even see an RTX 6050 or RX 9050",Positive

Compared to AMD, client and DCAI is doing well, for client CPUs and GPUs are doing well, putting no pressure in mobile, in fact their strategy has remained the same in the past couple the years and even if marginally their % share is sufficient for them. Intel pushes a lot of supply for mobile, while AMD is smaller, it is all relative in the necessary investments they need to make in order to supply demand. Do I wish AMD stop stagnating in designs, yeah, RDNA3 needs to go, but these companies have motives in what they do.",Neutral
Intel,"We all saw it coming a mile away, when it came out in 2025 it was competing against discounted 4060 laptops as low as just $1000. Too little, too late, too expensive, dated on arrival with RDNA3.5, etc. But for some reason this sub and r / amd always have such a hard on at the concept of a ""big APU"" that in practice would never be economically sensible.",Negative
Intel,Arc 140T is already on par with the 890m for most tasks excluding games.,Neutral
Intel,Commercial failure indeed. Laptop with dGPUs at same price perform better. Laptops with solid CPU perf are much cheaper.,Neutral
Intel,AMD gave Strix Halo zero chance to compete by barely selling any of the lower end models. An 8 core with 32 CUs would be a great mini PC.,Negative
Intel,"I dunno Battlemage was a big step forward on driver compatibility and every month Intel improves all their Arc compatibility. I'd be honestly surprised if Xe3 was worse than their current offerings. I'm sure it still has shortcomings as all Intel GPUs will because they're simply starting fresh, but even my A750 is pretty good right now at playing anything I throw at it.  The only aspect Intel kind of messed up that annoys me is their video encoder, once it gets pegged to 100%, it absolutely tanks your performance on the capture to the point where it skips frames and lags. It never used to do that and the driver also used to include capture software, now they just offload it to people having to download OBS and removed the capture aspect of the driver. Kind of dumb when both NVIDIA and AMD include it as a driver option.",Negative
Intel,Driver support is better than ever and will continue to get better now that Intel has found its footing in the gaming GPU business (yes that includes igpus),Positive
Intel,"If TSMC does raise price on their node, Nvidia doesn't find another node for their lower-end bins and Intel can keep the price on their own node down low, we could see Nvidia simply slowly phasing out the -50 series like they used to do with the MX series.",Neutral
Intel,"The 4050 still has a sizeable memory bandwidth advantage, so it's still very surprising that the B390 comes so close.",Neutral
Intel,"oh damn, this should be a lot higher up! Most laptops have them clocked much higher so expecting 4050mobile performance is kinof a lie...",Negative
Intel,"I get the feeling everybody is still unsure where these PTL chips slot in to and what to compare these against actually. Once we get more info on pricing, power consumption, CPU performance etc. we will get some actually useful comparisons.",Neutral

Intel,"It seems the revived Dell XPS 16 will have the “B390” and no dGPU, as another option.

Intel,"$1100 for a little MSI 13"" laptop with one. there are also quite a few CPU SKUs that have the B390.",Neutral
Intel,"Those 16 cores are 4 performance cores, 8 efficiency cores and 4 “Low Power” efficiency cores. This is only doubling the core count of Lunar Lake, by adding the two plain efficiency core clusters. Or keeping the same core count as ArrowLake mobile’s 285H (not HX!), trading 2 performance cores for 2 “Low Power” efficiency cores.  I’m not 100% on this but I don’t think Stryx Halo used AMD’s C cores, so it basically had an entire 9950x attached to the iGPU.  Prices should be more normal, as this is more part of Intel’s normal lineup.",Neutral
Intel,There's an Ultra 5 chip with the B370 (10 Xe cores instead of the 12). Shouldn't be too costly,Neutral
Intel,It's 16 cores but it's only comparable to Strix Point 12 cores and not Strix Halo.      The highest end Intel chip here only matches the number of P cores in the M5,Neutral

Intel,Well unified core is supposed to be happening in the next couple of gens. Frequencies also seem to have taken a hit on 18A but I'd expect that to improve with time as usual,Neutral
Intel,Not really. They just need to not completely bungle gaming and latency sensitive performance like with Arrow.,Neutral
Intel,"This is about mobile devices, and since a high performing IGPU is included, the question is no longer how well the CPU performs in a system with a 5090 (what most cpu benchmarks focus on) but how well this IGPU/CPU combination performs compared to other IGPU/CPU combinations. I am positive the CPU is not the limiting factor in this IGPU performance tier, so ""leading edge CPU performance"" is not really relevant.",Neutral
Intel,"Don't think it's completely absurd. Should get some efficiencies from less interconnect overhead and lower power memory, so not quite 1:1 with a dGPU. If we were to budget, say, 40W for the iGPU in gaming and 20W for the rest, should be perfectly in line with the higher end laptop SKUs.",Neutral
Intel,Intel Arrow Lake already uses 80W just on the CPU side in multicore,Neutral
Intel,"It would be viable if AMD released their own small PCs with it to cut the MSRP of products, but they aren't interested.",Neutral
Intel,And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Of course we don't know the cost breakdown there as far as PS5 pricing goes.,Neutral
Intel,They just need to make the next iteration cost less. Most of strix halo's issues were the sky high price.,Negative

Intel,well said,Neutral
Intel,Too much listening to MLiD who has a boner for APUs,Negative
Intel,"Idk one can easily flip your statement. Panther lake coming in **2026** competing against continuing discounted 4050s prob less than 4060s. I don't dislike Panther Lake nor am I defending Strix Halo, but I wouldn't say your argument is a rather good one.",Neutral
Intel,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ymoiWv9BF7Q   It's already at least on par for reasonable power profiles unless you play stuck to the wall.,Neutral

Intel,Nvidia will find another cheap node to use. Samsung will gladly oblige,Positive
Intel,"153 GB/s vs 192 GB/s is not that ""sizeable""  And the comparison against ""HP OmniStudio X 32-c0077ng"" is weird, even in the linked test they have GPU-Z screenshot displaying 1375Mhz memory speed instead of 2000 Mhz on most other RTX 4050 Laptop Review.  I don't understand this comparison against an All-in-One, and I'll wait for more in depth reviews to draw some conclusion.",Negative
Intel,"PC World had power consumption tests under gaming loads. It pulled 60W through USBC with Cyberpunk, so probably 35-40W for the gpu. When they unplugged it, the benchmark numbers stayed the same. So it also pulls 60W on battery.  Unless the manufacturer actually configured the device to simultaneously pull energy from the cord and battery under full load.",Neutral
Intel,About as much as we have PTL laptops,Neutral
Intel,"TB5 isn't a big deal, although I don't like that they have a numpad keyboard, and usually MSI speakers are terrible.",Negative

Intel,"> I’m not 100% on this but I don’t think Stryx Halo used AMD’s C cores, so it basically had an entire 9950x attached to the iGPU.  I have a Strix Halo.  What you wrote is exactly what it is.  It's essentially a 9950x (so all P-cores) with a fat iGPU attached, and with a 4 channel memory controller instead of 2-channel.",Neutral
Intel,"The biggest difference between the P and E cores is fMax. The larger the core count becomes, the lower the all core clocks become, the smaller the gap between P and E core performance becomes.   The IPC difference between the two is like ~10%  At a certain point along the wattage curve, given a certain number of cores, there will be a point where E core performance can potentially meet or exceed what you would've gotten has you had too many P cores.    Its also more than just trading 2 P cores for 2 lpE cores. The lpE cores in ARL-H were *so* weak, they were functionally useless. In practice, it'll be more like trading 2 P cores for 4 lpE cores  edit: to be more specific, In ARL-H, below 5W per core, E cores outperform P cores. If you have 16 cores and are running all core workloads, then at 60W, each core is receiving less than 4W.",Neutral
Intel,No it's firmly ahead of strix its right in between. Strix point uses 8 ecores too and it gets demolished in multithread benchmarks as expected,Neutral
Intel,"It affects their margins. The more competitive and better QC is, the less Intel can charge OEMs for their CPUs.     AMD made them lower margins for laptop chips because they weren't very competitive. If they want fat margins, they need to be the best",Neutral
Intel,Single Core is very important when Intel is doing these designs that lack P cores throughout. The cheapest X2 Elite has the same amount of P cores as the most expensive Panther Lake SKU,Neutral
Intel,"Qualcomm is already super close with Oryon V3...  Perf/Watt for that single thread isn't close I guess, but absolute performance is breathing down Apple's neck for sure.  Also, don't compare Geekbench scores on windows vs Linux/Apple/Android... Windows just does something negatively about it and the difference is 5-7% vs non-windows.",Neutral
Intel,>Well unified core is supposed to be happening in the next couple of gens.  I would be shocked if this has much to do with a large performance uplift. I imagine it would have to do more with rightsizing core area and power draw.,Negative
Intel,Chasing above 5Ghz is stupid on laptops. It only matters for desktops,Negative
Intel,You are overly focusing on gaming. I mean general CPU performance,Neutral
Intel,Rtx 5050 is 61% faster than B390. I doubt if they change the wattage configuration and stick to 60W they'll match it. Unless the 5050 is capped to more reasonable wattages like 60-80W. Plus the 60W budget for Intel/amd will be used for other compotents and the apu budget reduces.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm talking out of my knowledge base, but I think the switch from heat pipes to custom vapor chambers means we are less bottlenecked at power density / pulling heat from the chip and more constrained at what the radiator/fan system can push out of the system.",Neutral
Intel,"They announced a first party Strix Halo PC at CES, but it'll probably be really expensive.",Neutral
Intel,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips. But if you want true performance, just go out and buy an RTX X060 series laptop it's far better price to perf each generation.",Neutral
Intel,"What is possible? PS5 uses GDDR6 instead of DRAM. And consoles are heavily subsidized by digital purchases. I bet AMD makes good money on PS5 (and Xbox X/S), Sony & Microsoft just subsidize the shit out of it with their 30% cut from selling games. Even the Steam Deck is barely profitable for Valve. High-end APU is just a waste of sillicon.",Negative

Intel,"140T (Arrow Lake) isn't the same as 140v (Lunar Lake) though, the former is usually quite a bit weaker and inconsistent in games despite slaying all the synthetics.",Neutral
Intel,"It is probably because the AIO was one of their most, if not the most recent RTX 4050 tested (March 17th 2025) which probably enabled them to compare in newer title like F1 25 in the article, as it has already been around for like 3 years while RTX 5050 was released last year and received more attention in its place overall. From their database, the next most recent thing with RTX 4050 they reviewed was the Yoga Pro 7 in January 2025 with a 60W RTX 4050 (45 watts + 15 watts Dynamic Boost), which scored 50.8fps in Cyberpunk 2077 at the same setting and thus a bit lower than the AIO, so I would say the AIO is at an okay spot for a RTX 4050 to be compared to this Arc B390.",Neutral

If QC captures market share and reaches 10-15%, then Intel will start to sweat and then margins will be hit. I don't think QC gets anywhere near that till like 2028/2029.

Arrow lake (Desktop) at least closed on efficiency, but lacks a bit of gaming performance still, hopefully Nova Lake will be the step required to push more competition.   On GPU the same, AMD does not compete with NVIDIA in higher segments while NVIDIA is fairly comfortable with their setup and increases prices because they want to milk customers to increase their ridiculious margins (up to 70%) that they are used to from AI-Chips.   And now Intel also provides Multi-Frame generation, while a niche for me still, starting to compete with AMD and closes up to NVIDIA in terms of Software support, which they lacked the most and fixes a lot of problems.

This directly threatens Nvidia's consumer laptop volume in the entry segment. Intel is claiming close to 4050 performance at this lower TDP, and that's certainly good enough for many to not have the tradeoffs of having a dGPU in their laptop.  If the new market is moving towards putting GPUs on the CPU package instead of discretely on the board, Nvidia doesn't want to place all of their hopes on WoA becoming better, and are hedging by doing both their own SoC *and* an x86 APU with Intel.  The XPS line dropping Nvidia discrete all together is proof of this. In these sub 70W total laptop power markets, a discrete GPU is just eats into the power budget too much.",Neutral

Intel,The relative proportion of the die isn't as important as the die size itself and the node ofc.   Lunar lake for example has an estimated die size smaller than the hx370 so even if they did make the die bigger I don't think that is going to massively raise the price. Not to mention intel owns the foundry unlike AMD who are outsourcing to TSMC. This isn't in the realm of a strix halo competitor with a 300 mm\^2 + die size.

Intel,The thing about that... what sort of tile are we expecting them to package up? As you say if we can get 4050ish performance from an Intel iGPU then they really can't be far off 5050M... and maybe even 5060M performance in future.  Do you think they'll offer something like a 5070 tile? that almost seems excessive (and difficult to actually package from a thermal point of view in a laptop) but it seems like the 5050/5060 sort of tier is going to be pretty well covered as a traditional iGPU soon.,Neutral

The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins. For all purposes it's an accounting trick to hide CCG's and DCAI's 5-15% operating margins if you divide the foundry losses per group revenue.",Neutral

Intel,"even if you exclude the CPU CCDs the graphics die alone is bigger than a RTX 5070Ti mobile GPU, which also retails for \~$2000-$3000, same as Strix Halo laptop",Neutral
Intel,"This is slightly splitting hairs but the 8c CCDs in Strix Halo is actually NOT the same chiplet as the ones in desktop zen 5 parts. It iirc is produced on a smaller node, slimmed down, and has different ( or no) TSVs.  It is similar to design and cache sizes to desktop however, but the changes to the CCDs were done to improve low power performance characteristics. They are likely a bit more expensive than Desktop CCDs.  I believe it is discussed in a chips&cheese deep dive.",Neutral
Intel,"AMD have largely been ""winning by doing nothing"" due to their better driver support stack for gaming on iGPUs, rather than actually throwing superior hardware at it.  It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.  Given how effective DLSS is on the Switch2, one could only imagine how kickass a Nvidia chip in a handheld PC could be with the far more ubiquitous DLSS support.",Neutral
Intel,Now they are not. The panther lake igpus are undisputed winners (excluding the 395+ from amd since it's just not gonna be mainstream). You can get a 358H or 368H and you'll have solid laptop for igpu gaming far cheaper than the 395+,Positive

Intel,"Well you said it, it's TSMC capacity, meaning also a priority issue. They prioritize AI over consumers and then increase the price by reducing availability, meaning the same chip costs more, meaning more margin.  Seeing they increase the 5090 to roughly 5k (USD) is just the beginning and as I know all companies will use the increasing memory prices to say they must increase the product price, just not proportional to the memory costs.  next step: then they will use this to move more to streaming instead of owning",Neutral

A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.  Sorry for the rambling.",Neutral

Intel,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW? But yeah high end perf scaling falls apart at sub 4K internal res.",Negative

Intel,I feel like more people paying more attention since the market’s grown a lot.   I remember old games I played in the early 2000s having micro and regular stuttering depending on the game. I chalked it up to “huh guess it’s loading in data as I play” when I didn’t know much.,Neutral
Intel,We are paying more attention to it but I suspect as we push higher frames with new engines and techniques the micro stutter is getting worse. It just starts becoming less perceptible to people than say the micro stutter from SLI and other stuff that caused issues in the past.,Negative
Intel,"I think digital foundry answered that question on their podcast. Compared to 15 years ago the frame rate is higher on average for most gamers, but it also stutters more. So it's huge fps with huge drops and hangs.",Neutral
Intel,"Worth remembering no one even gave a shit about stuttering enough to measure it until someone at I think it was anandtech back in the late 00s was so fed up with shitty perf on his crossfire system he started doing 1% lows on benchmarks.   Back in the 90s people would run like 6x SLI voodoos and not even care that the game hitched every 10 seconds down to sub 30s fps lol...  Edit: it's also key to remember that a lot of the games that stutter on PC these days stutter in the exact same places for the exact same reasons, and worse considering the lack of CPU power, on consoles. Console gamers just don't give a fuck lol....   DF did a good video showing this truth with the Silent Hill 2 remake.",Negative

Intel,"I dunno I remember many games, especially based on Quake engine, being buttery smooth if you could get to reasonable FPS",Neutral
Intel,also more cause for stutering. Back then we could compile shaders real time with no siginficant issues because they were small. Now we have to compile shaders real time that are huge to the point where we pre-compile half of them before we even start the game.,Neutral
Intel,Console gamers *of certain genres* care.   The FGC rejected the idea of playing Street Fighter IV & MvC3  on PS3 because the Xbox 360 port had better input latency.   Even the PS4 port of USFIV wasn't liked.     Part of why I stopped going to tournaments is because SFV & Tekken 7 on PS4 always felt *off* compared to PC.,Negative
Intel,"Not really. In many cases, console versions of games just don't stutter whereas PC games do because modern games are mainly designed for consoles and then ported to PC.  A couple of good recent examples are Wukong and Outer Words 2. Neither of those games on consoles have the horrid stutters that are prevalent on PC.",Negative

Plenty of content he could have farmed off that, especially BEFORE the RAM shortage where having an 8GB card was some sort of sin in his eyes (except for some reason he ignored it but raile roaded the cheaper RTX 5050, lol did someone say bias?). Instead, he just tore the 9060 XT 8GB down and never touched it again after that teardown. I'm sorry but there's GENUINELY stuff he could be doing instead of farming clicks about 'NVIDIA bad' and 'Intel pathetic', but that won't get him views from drama farming NVIDIA which is what he craves these days. So sad to see a big channel like his who got big off doing solid technical content become a drama-hype ""news"" channel.",Negative

Intel,"Geekbench’s scaling has always been problematic, and the differences between architectures are huge. The benchmark is very friendly to ARM and least favorable to AMD. Even a random Apple M5 chip can easily score close to 20,000.  Therefore, cross-architecture comparisons using Geekbench scores have little real meaning.

For example, if the 285H needs around **80W** to reach 22,500, then the real question is:  * How much power does the 388H need to reach 22,500? * How many watts does it take to exceed 20,000?

Intel,"Geekbench claims it's much more realistic than those multicore tests that scale nearly perfectly with tons of cores, and I think that's a fair take. It's not as if they didn't know how to create a benchmark that scales like other nT tests do, geekbench 5 nT does that.   I wouldn't call it worse, just different.",Negative
Intel,Geekbench runs common workloads as they are commonly implemented. It gives you a score on how well a multi core implementation of that workload would actually run in that CPU.   I think that is far more useful than some perfectly parallel workload measuring max power and core count.,Positive
Intel,"I have carefully compared the various models across Geekbench, PassMark, and the differences between Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake. If my judgment is correct, the theoretical peak performance of the 484 in Cinebench R23 should reach around **24,500**; the 285H scores **22,500**. Compared with the 285H, it should be easier for the 484 to achieve high scores because its power requirements are significantly lower than the previous generation built on TSMC N3B.  Its peak performance will not be extremely strong because the frequency is not high. IPC is likely improved by around **10–11%**, but clock speeds drop by about **6%**. Overall, that means single-core performance should only rise by **4–5%**.  The improvement will be most noticeable in Geekbench. Since PassMark single-core also shows gains, the IPC uplift and resulting single-core increase should be quite certain. If Geekbench were the only source, it would still be questionable, but PassMark is more solid and has higher reference value.  Overall, in terms of peak performance, the uplift is average—around **10%**, close to that figure.  However, the real key is the **efficiency gains**. I believe they will be excellent. Compared with the 285H, which requires **65 W** to reach **20,000** points in Cinebench R23, I estimate that the **388H** may only need **40–45 W**.  I also estimate that the Cinebench R24 score should fall around **1300–1400**. Compared with Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 at **1950**, there is still a significant gap—but the two products differ drastically in scale.  Overall, Panther Lake’s greatest achievements lie in several aspects:  1. **Energy efficiency** — likely the best among all x86 products. 2. **Performance per mm²** — excellent. For example, the 484: if you look at its die shot, the total area of the CPU (including the CPU tile’s 4P and 4 LPE cores and all caches) is essentially equal to the die area of a traditional monolithic 8-core design. That means the 484 uses the same silicon resources as past 8-core chips, yet **no AMD mobile 8-core processor surpasses it**, either in raw performance or efficiency. 3. It also offers better performance-per-area than Qualcomm’s processors. The X Elite 2 has **18 cores**, including **12 “very large” cores**—similar in size to Intel P-cores—and **6 large cores**, each larger than Intel’s E-cores. The die area of this chip is **2.5× larger** than Panther Lake 484’s.",Neutral

Second is the memory itself, they need something with higher bandwidth (but that might be addressed with LPDDR6).  To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.  Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.

Intel,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.  EDIT: 8060S (Strix Halo) is \~18,000 for reference.  EDIT 2: 890M (strix point's top end) about 8,100, so the PTL 12Xe chip will smoke that.

Well, we already had rumors of Intel struggling to hit actual intended frequency-goals, no?  Though especially the actual performance-metrics of the node will be quite sobering I think.  The power-draw of these SKUs is supposed to be a TDP of *officially* 25W – In reality, these parts are allowed to draw as much as 55W (2+0+4 or 4+0+4) and 65/80W (4+4+4 and 4+8+4) respectively.  So it must be seen, if these parts are any more efficient in daily usage, or just a side-grade to Lunar Lake.",Negative
Intel,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power. A 10-15% frequency advantage would go a long, long way towards closing gaps if it comes as a relatively small power cost.",Neutral

Intel,">I can't say I'm entirely sold on the idea of having three core clusters humming inside my laptop.  From a user's perspective, CPU's are a blackbox and the inner-working details are irrelevant. What matters is results. They want, typically, a balance of performance, battery life, heat / fan noise, and cost, placing greater emphasis on one of these categories over the others.  The idea is that P cores = performance optizied  E cores = Area optimized  LP-E Cores = power optimized.  The theory being to have different core types focus on different parts of PPA.  E cores and LP-E cores are the same microarchitecture. Just LP-E cores are off-ring so the ring (and rest of the cores) can be powered down in light-load scenarios.  Intel's biggest problem is that looking at each of the cores, the P cores perform their designated role the worst. 200% larger than E cores for \~10% more IPC and \~15% more clockspeed is a pretty rough trade off - and by the time you've loaded all P cores and need to load E cores too, that clockspeed difference diminishes hard.

With fewer thermal constraints and much higher power budgets, they should be able to push well past the perf/W peak, where it should continue to scale well and for a long time before it starts hitting severely diminishing returns.  I'm not talking 300W monster CPUs, but the scaling between a 65W and 105W 18A CPU should be more significant than on current nodes, where you might gain like 10-15% additional performance from that 50% power bump.

For that you'd want to look ahead to 14A where the CFO mentioned on the earnings call (and he was somewhat realistic in other areas so it's more believable here) that 14A has been a positive surprise and they're actually pretty excited about it.

They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them.

Every research report shows that demand for high-end GPUs is still strong. Steam HW survey shows the most popular GPUs are still mid-range gaming cards, showing that discrete GPUs remain central to the PC ecosystem.  And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",Neutral

Intel,Fair. If your on a tight budget. Consider some of the RDNA3 AMD cards as well. I mean if your looking at a 3 generation old 3060 anyway. Something like the 7600 XT 16gb might be on the market where you are at a good price. Its probably 20% or so faster then a 3060.,Positive
Intel,"Check your GPU utilization in the game. If it's near 100%, then a GPU upgrade is the best option. But, I encourage you not to buy the RTX 3050. Try to get at least a 3060.",Neutral
Intel,Intel has GPUs for a while they got a pretty good budget option too (just some problems with it though) called the Intel arc b580. Anyways upgrading to AM5 is not viable as its Ramageddon so ram prices are horrendous rn. I recommend checking out the 5600xt or 5800XT CPU. As for the GPU try looking for a 9060xt 8gb or 16gb it's a pretty budget option that'll do you well. If you have a budget of around 200-300 get rtx 3060. Before all this though what's your PSU wattage,Neutral
Intel,"If you're open to getting used, might be able to upgrade both. Ryzen 5600 are ~100-120 USD used on Ebay or on Aliexpress (or look around for a local seller on Facebook Marketplace or /r/hardwareswap) and it drops right into your board to replace the 2600. Pair that with an Arc B580 (~250, maybe less used) and you've got a pretty solid setup.",Neutral
Intel,Why not find a decent 5000 series cpu and thenulgrade the gpu?,Negative
Intel,What's your budget?,Neutral
Intel,"What is you max budget? Anyway, since the RAM price is pretty fcked nowadays, I recommend you to stay on AM4 platform and just upgrade the CPU instead of straight away go to AM5 or Intel DDR5 equivalent  Unless you can only afford 3050 or 1660 Super, you'd better with something like 3060 12GB or something else",Neutral
Intel,What speed is that RAM?,Neutral
Intel,"Keep the Ryzen 7 2700, B450 mb, 32g ram and get a GPU. You said the Intel B570 but for a little more you can get Intel B580 if your PSU and MB support it. You also said I5 14400 but then you would need another Motherboard.",Neutral
Intel,"hey brother I have the same build (except I use Strix X470-I Gaming mobo and 16GB RAM). I am upgrading to a 5700x, a 9060 XT 16GB and 64GB of RAM.",Neutral
Intel,"Any 5000-series CPU would be a *massive* upgrade, however… GPUs specifically will see massive price hikes & shortages in the next couple months. So it might actually be the last time you can snag a cheap used GPU.  Forget the 3050, a 3060Ti is an excellent value under $200. If you can find a 12GB version, you’ll be especially glad you did. I’d recommend a 4060 for the same price range, but your motherboard is most likely PCI gen 3, so a 30-series card is your best bet. With the latest DLSS updates, I’d personally stick with RTX, especially with a lower-power card.",Positive

Intel,"Did you update your bios to the latest stable (non beta)?   Maybe do a windows reinstall? Like you can install again to try and get some of the quirks worked out so you don’t have old cpu files and such.   Also, I wonder if the funky old cpu pci lane limits got stuck in bios maybe. Might have to check to see if you’re running full x16.",Neutral
Intel,Are you that upset with performance?,Neutral
Intel,"You are hypothetically going from PCIe 4.0 x8 (limitation of 8700G) to PCIe 5.0 x16 (limitation of the board & 7800X3D) and that would quadruple bandwidth. But PCIe is rarely the bottleneck. The greatest difference you'd see if your game wants more than 16 GB VRAM (limit of 9070 XT) and needs to start swapping with main RAM (your 32 GB DDR5), but most games aren't doing that yet. I would wait on a new generation of CPUs. Hopefully AMD's next refresh is compelling 🤞",Neutral
Intel,Havent upgraded to the x3d yet! my bad mustve not made it clear.,Negative
Intel,"More so with the inconsistency.. changing sceneries or more AI on screen usually tanks the frame rate. For example, on an indoor map ill get 130+ stable most of the time but during outdoors busy scenarios, most noticeably the 1% lows tank more than the fps which stays around 90-100",Positive
Intel,Thanks for the detailed response :),Positive
Intel,"This isn't very accurate. Even outside of vram bound games an x3d chip will out perform a non x3d chip (especially a weak one like an 8700g). OP was already complaining in another comment about 1% lows feeling bad, which happens to be a specialty of x3d chips.",Negative
Intel,"I’m that case, a cpu upgrade might be good. The 8700g has PCIe 4.0 but also limited PCIe lanes to split among other things like gpu/nvme etc. it also has a lower l3 cache so even a 7700x would be a decent upgrade.",Positive
Intel,"Set your max frame rate limit for the game under the max frame rate of the display.  Check for errors in Event Viewer > Windows Logs > System and see whether you are throwing errors during stutters.  Also, make sure your display is plugged into card and not into motherboard.   It is typical for outdoor scenes to be more taxing because the draw distance can be longer.   Try other games.",Neutral
Intel,"X3d chips have great 1% lows. If I were you I'd just enjoy the upgrade and sell the 8700g. 7800x3d will be an absolute beast for years and years to come, so you won't have to upgrade for AWHILE.",Positive

Intel,5060 is faster for arc raiders natively and considering the feature advantage I would def go for it.  Although keep in mind if you go over the 8gb vram limit the 9060 xt will handle that better and is faster on average just not in arc raiders,Positive
Intel,Get the 5060! It has a better feature set like better upscaling and better Ray Tracing! You also don't have to deal with crappy AMD drivers which I have experienced and many AMD RX 9000 series users are also experiencing! You have better peace of mind with the Nvidia GPU!,Positive

Intel,"The 9060XT is the stronger card. At 1080p don't even think about the 16Gb. Traditionally, AMD updates their cards and the performance grows more and more over time. Personally, I'd get the AMD card. The ""benefits"" you get from Nvidia cards are useless at a 5060 level of performance. The pure raster advantage of the 9060XT will last you longer",Positive
Intel,Arc Raiders came out 3 months ago. You're going to own that GPU for years. Buying a GPU for one specific game seems like a bad idea.,Negative
Intel,You will massively regret buying an 8gb card if you ever want to use a higher resolution than 1080p. The 9060xt 16gb is worth it. Better to save up and put off the purchase than to buy something you will be disappointed with.,Negative
Intel,"There's a very good reason to not get an 8GB card though. It's just not worth it at this point in time. Its longevity is severely limited, do yourself a favour and just avoid any 8GB graphics cards.",Negative
Intel,Its not a 20% perfomance increase. It is the difference between 10fps and 80fps when you go to 1440p or your 4k TV.  See https://youtu.be/7LhS0_ra9c4?si=z9VGzFIq3qbLEMc_,Neutral
Intel,Seems I've been a victim of cherry picking then my bad I've just ran with it from what I've seen with most content creators. Still 9060xt is cheaper for them so they should get it,Negative
Intel,"I'm surprised how close the 5060 is to the 9060xt, 8gb. The both play games well at 1080p so most people will be happy with either and yes vram an issue but I'd you don't play many AAA games this won't be an issue, we also can't ignore ram shortage this will affect consoles etc in the future.",Neutral
Intel,"Im glad i could help, the advantage of going Nvidia is DLSS, it is superior to FSR and it is implemented in way more games.  It will serve you well, i also own it and i like it",Positive
Intel,The 16 GB model will be the 5060 Ti if I am not wrong! The 5060 Ti is around 15-16% faster than the 5060 but if you can afford the 5060 Ti 16GB then I would suggest you to surely get it as it will be relevant for much longer in the future and Nvidia is going to stop production of the 16gb 5060 ti this year going from the rumours!,Positive
Intel,No AMD drivers are still buggy! You can just check the r/AMDHelp and r/Radeon subreddits and there are multiple new posts everyday with complaints about driver timeouts or crashing or something else! I know from experience too!

Intel,"Oh so true i tought the 5060 was the cheaper one ,he should get the 9060xt",Neutral
Intel,At 1080 both of them can play absolutely any AAA game without any problem ( medium is needed in indiana jones ) but the rest can run at high,Neutral
Intel,"Yes, that still seems to be the consensus very much. Better upscaling and drivers.",Positive
Intel,"The 5060 Ti 16 GB is ~$630 here. Think the 9070 (non xt) would give better performance for that price range ($650 where I live). The pricing ladder in my market, I tell you! 😅",Neutral
Intel,I own one buddy. I have never had a single issue with my 9070xt. The only people posting to this subreddits are people having issues that the overwhelming majority of people do not have. It’s biased by the nature of what it is .   If amd gpus had driver issues you would see big publications talking about them but you don’t. You are propagating a myth.  You’re also conveniently ignoring the disastrous 50 series launch drivers for NVIDIA.,Negative
Intel,"Curious - in what kind of situations does the 5060 run into vram limitations in your experience with it? If I play something like Arc Raiders at 1080p at high (second highest), would I ""run out of vram?""   I'm afraid I still don't understand how that works entirely. Have you had such instances with the 5060?",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, but super hard/rare to come by. They get snagged up pretty fast too.",Negative

Intel,Yes he is interested in using his 4k TV at lower settings and framerate. It will not be playable with a 8gb gpu.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah i also moved to nvidia even though it is not allways the best price for performance because my last 2 AMD cards ( 5700xt and 6650xt ) could not run God Of War at all no matter the video settings or resolution, the game kept dropping to 30 fps, and it is a common issue with Amd and god of war games and they still have not fixed it.  There are more issues like this, some are fixable if you google the solution, some are not and after the thing with god of war i decided to give up on amd for now, they also didnt add FSR4 to previous gen GPU s ( like the 7000 series) , while Nvidia gave DLSS 4.5 even to the first RTX cards.",Negative
Intel,Then stick to 5060! For almost double the price it is not worth it!,Negative
Intel,You are welcome to make your assumptions and share your own experience but I can only speak based on my experience with them and what I observe from my reddit scrolls! I switched to the Green Side and won't be going for a new Radeon GPU anytime soon.,Neutral
Intel,"You can play Arc Raider at max settings and you wont run out of Vram, personally  i never ran out of vram because i dont allways play the latest games ( i play at 1080p )  In the Game Indiana Jones ( which is a very bad optimised game )you have to set the settings to medium to not run out of vram and i think in the new Doom you have to use high, thats it, in some future released games you might have to use high/medium instead of ultra.  When you run out of vram the game gets very bad frame drops.  I play Cyberpunk on a mix of high and very high i think and i dont have any issues with vram for example, same for BF6.  At 4k resolution the vram issues appear in newer titles",Neutral
Intel,At 1080p you will almost never run into a VRAM issue and Nvidia cards are also more efficient in VRAM utilisation! They are also much more power efficient i.e. they will consume less power for the same level of performance which saves some electricity while also giving your power supply more headroom!,Positive
Intel,Can you go find a 5700xt and run that until you've saved for a  16GB card?  If you ever wanna move to the TV or even a better monitor 8GB is gonna be out gunned real fast.,Neutral
Intel,"Oh right yeah 😅  I don’t even own a TV, that wouldn’t cross my mind.",Negative
Intel,"Haha what, more power efficient?",Positive
Intel,Not available here. What about a 7700xt for ~$380 (vs 9060xt 16gb @~$500) or a 7600 xt for $270 vs (5060 @~$500)?  Used market is not ideal here. They're either overpriced or they get snapped up in minutes.,Neutral
Intel,"Regardless, the 8gb models on some modern games run out of VRAM at 1080p. I assume most spend hundreds of euros to have a useful product for several years, not just a single.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah true, that’s why I grabbed a 5060 Ti 16 GB last month myself :’) But also I didn’t wanna downgrade in vram from my 3060 12 GB.",Neutral
Intel,"Sigh, how I wish I could get a 5060 ti. That's ~$600 here. How about a 7700xt for ~$380? (Keep in mind the 9060 16gb is $500 here)?",Neutral
Intel,Well you could use Optiscaler to get FSR 4 on older Radeon cards and the 7700 XT comes with 12 GB of VRAM which is definitely better than 8 GB. I don’t see why not.,Positive
Intel,"did you use DDU to remove your 3070 drivers before you installed the 5070? Either some kind of conflicting driver situation or your card is artifacting under load.  I would probably do a full DDU driver install and then go from there.  Depending on how recently i'd probably return it to the retailer instead of RMA, that shit takes forever.",Negative
Intel,"As I said, I nuked the ssd and I installed windows from scratch, so no DDU was needed. When the purple shit happened the game HUD was completely visible above the distortion. I could also see pings on the display clearly. The card ran on full load in stress tests for hours without breaking a sweat. I am really confused by this behavior. Should it artifact in stress test load as well? Otherwise yes, it is still under return period but I would really like to keep it, as it was on a great deal. Still, if it’s faulty I have no other choice but to return it.",Negative

Intel,">30c ish at idle to 60-80c under load.  That sounds normal my guy intel i9s are well known power hogs, the 200-300w that thing consumes will generate that kind of heat. Most people with that cpu run it with a 360mm aio to keep the temps in check.  Id suggest getting a 360mm rad.

Intel,"Those temperatures could be totally normal for the 12900kf / 240mm, depending on your room ambient temp and your case air flow. TjMax for that CPU is 100c as well, so running at 80c is totally safe and won't even throttle.",Positive
Intel,"If the AIO screw has springs, you don't need to force it.. Check if paste covers whole surface and if you got the stock cooler try using it if not get a cheap cooler",Neutral
Intel,The pump is set at a certain speed. Can you go to bios and bump up the pump speed to check if that resolves anything?,Neutral
Intel,"Start with setting up your PL1/2 for the capacity of your AIO. If it is set to standard, 4096W, you are going to have problems cooling that thing. Start with 253/253 standard Intel would be 125/253/304A and keep lowering that until there is no more thermal throttling. After that you can fine tune with undervolt etc.  And ofcourse check AIO mounting, pump, fluid.",Neutral
Intel,For both 12th and 13th gen you can do the following:  - turn hyperthreading off - enable only 8 ecores - Set a negative voltage offset of - 0.050  Play games for a couple of hours if no crashes then decrease offset by another 0.025 (I.e. 0.075). And keep going till you find the lowest voltage without crashes. This will increase 1% lows tremendously in games too.   Once you're stable and if temps are still too high (thermal throttle) then you can reduce clock speed by 100hz and keep doing it till you're happy. Reducing by 200mhz doesn't hurt gaming performance.  Benchmark a CPU limited game (or make it CPU limited by lowering the resolution) before you start so you can see the gains.,Neutral
Intel,not a single mention of voltages?,Negative
Intel,"I ordered a new case and a 360mm AIO which is supposed to be here tomorrow, since my current case doesn't support a 360 on the top, I plan to move everything over sometime this weekend.

Intel,"You are going to buy this? Why would you do that when you could get an older processor, mobo and ram so you can afford an actual usable gpu? No offense. This is just bizarre to me personally",Negative
Intel,"Go for AM4 or LGA1700 so you can use DDR4 instead of the insanely expensive DDR5. Then sell the stick you have now and reap the profits, or keep it for if you ever decide to upgrade in the future to a DDR5 platform. DDR4 is also still just a more stable technology in general in my experience. Older platform boards and chips will also be cheaper than AM5, while still enabling you to build a massively overpowered system for your use case. You can also put that money saved into other things in your life, or into a more powerful GPU like a B580 or 9060XT.  For example, instead of a Ryzen 7600, I'd recommend a 5700 for about the same price. Somewhat slower individual cores, but there are more of them (you're unlikely to notice the difference with the games you play), and your board and RAM will be a lot cheaper (you can also get much better memory than that for the price with DDR4, that DDR5 you have is bottom of the barrel stuff meant for office PCs, not for gaming). A nice Gen 4 SSD isn't too expensive still, and then you can use the difference for a better GPU, or as I mentioned before, to put to use elsewhere.  Also, if you use a good board with a second x16 PCIe slot, you can use that RX480 as a Lossless Scaling frame generation card. Or render the game on the 480 and use the 1050ti as a frame generation card.",Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, those boot times and random freezes scream failing HDD. Your old drive is likely on its last legs, and that’s probably what’s killing your internet connection too when the OS hangs.  About the new build: Going AM5 with the 7600 is a smart move. It’s a massive jump. But since you’re buying DDR5, try to get a 6000MHz kit instead of 4800MHz. Ryzen 7000 series really needs that extra speed to shine, and 4800MHz will actually hold your CPU back more than you think.  Also, just a heads-up on the PSU: that CiT FX Pro is pretty bottom-tier. Since you’re buying a nice ROG Strix board and a modern CPU, I’d spend a bit more on a reliable power supply (like a Corsair or Seasonic) just to be safe.  Swap to that RX 480 for now—it’ll definitely beat your 1050 Ti while you save for a modern GPU. Once you install Windows on that NVMe SSD, the PC is going to feel like a rocket ship compared to your old OptiPlex",Negative
Intel,Nothing wrong with that at all.  A nice GPU upgrade that's reasonably priced would bea Radeon 5700XT.  Ebay has them for $150 or so and it's still a very capable card.

A good strategy / upgrade path I've used over the years is to sink around $1000 into a quality build minus graphics card, then 4/5 years later sink around $300/$400 into a decent current-gen graphics card. Then a few years later repeat the process (using the old graphics car with the new build.)

Intel,"If the B580 has good performance in the game that you are interested in then it can be a good option. However, in some games there are driver overhead issues. So you cant trust every benchmark with a 7800x3d/9800x3d to estimate the GPU performance. In some games performance is reduced with a Ryzen 5 5600 for example. If this has been fixed in your games (or you have a stronger CPU) then the b580 is a good choice.",Positive

Intel,"So the 9th gen is a bit of a weird CPU right now, you do have a couple of decent upgrade options, but also you cannot go past the 9th gen without a new motherboard. Also the 9th gen is quickly coming up on 6 years old now as well.   My affordable advice would be to grab a 9700k and a better CPU cooler, then you can start to worry about the GPU which is very PSU dependent anyways. Without knowing the PSU I cant really make a suggestion anyways.   But the truth is, I would almost start fresh. New mobo, cpu, PSU and GPU. It would be more pricy, but also a far better use of your money than dumping it into a system that will be too slow to run new games in just a year or two.",Neutral
Intel,"I mean, really both kinda. 6500 XT is a notorious shite GPU but the games you play are CPU bound so a new CPU would do wonders. Budget is needed here.",Neutral
Intel,"I have the ASRock H310CM-HDV with an i5-9400. The beta BIOS will add Smart Access Memory (a.k.a., resizable bar). This may improve GPU performance...depending on game.  An i9-9900 is in the $200+ range. An i7-9700 is in the $100+ range. The i9-9900's \~24% performance gain is questionable for \~100% increase in price. There are other options between your i3-9100f and the i7-9700...  Before dropping Benjamins on a new GPU, consider an overclock and undervolt of your 6500 XT:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxSLrvoejhg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxSLrvoejhg)  If the OC/UV yields ""good enough"" improvements, then you might be able to bypass the premiums being demanded in the current PC component market.",Neutral
Intel,"All the games you play avoid the problem of having a weak but modern gpu very well. Assuming you dont suddenly decide to play something more graphically intensive i reccomend upgrading your cpu seeing how it feels, then upgrading your gpu. The immediate option that comes to mind is the i5 9400f. It should be an approximate 25%-30% improvement in most of the games like cs2 due to the added cores, threads and clock speed compared to that fairly weak i3 cpu. Then you could do something like an RX 6600 for $120 if findable, if not I usually reccomend the 3060 12gb as a braindead midrange option still able to play anything, it's about 200.",Neutral
Intel,Get a 12th or 13th Intel i5 CPU and a decent GPU like the 5060 Ti or the 9060XT,Neutral
Intel,"What is your budget for upgrades?  Your GPU is currently being held back by your platform. The 6500XT only has PCIe x4, and LGA 1151 only has PCIe 3.0. 3.0x4 bottlenecks the card pretty badly, going from on par with an RX 580 to worse than an RX 570. Getting onto a newer platform with PCIe 4.0 would improve both your CPU and GPU.",Negative
Intel,"What you could/should upgrade depends entirely on budget. The CPU is nearly the slowest 9th gen Intel chip, so an upgrade there would help a lot. The ""Best In Slot"" CPU is the i9-9900K but those go for nearly $200 on eBay. You can find an i7-9700 for half that and while it's 50% faster multicore, it's only 10% faster single core and most games just use one or two cores, but there are exceptions: research which games you play to check. Fortnite and Arc Raiders can be CPU bound, so the i7-9700/K might help you out a lot with those games, or really any open world, multi-player type game. The GPU is also the slowest of the 6000 series. As far as new GPUs go, the Intel Arc B580 12GB at $250-$300 or the Radeon RX 9060XT 16GB at $380-$400 are best bang for the buck on the cheaper side, your options really open up on the used market. Go to the [Techpowerup specs page](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-6500-xt.c3850) and check out the Relative Performance of your card with faster ones. I would upgrade to something at least 200% relative performance or higher if you can afford it. Between the GPU and CPU, I'd say the GPU upgrade should take priority over CPU. While a much newer GPU might be bottlenecked by the 9100F, its vastly superior performance will leave the 6500XT in the dust. GTX 1080ti (\~$150) RTX 2080ti (\~240) RTX 3060ti (\~$220-250) RX 6750XT ($280-350) RX 6800 (\~$300) RTX 3080 (\~$350) all examples of decent used options that are considerably more powerful than the 6500.",Neutral
Intel,Adding a 9700K isn’t gonna fix the fact the GPUs being bottlenecked by PCIe 3.0.  An R5 3600 and a cheap B550 board would probably cost not much more than an 9700K and improve the GPUs performance quite a bit. It would still work with the 16GB DDR4 they already have.,Negative
Intel,I have seen many videos on how it is a bad card I haven’t had no problems so far but definitely on my list,Negative
Intel,LGA 1700 isn’t worth recommending at all. DDR4 performance has aged terribly because newer games are more memory demanding. DDR4 boards have also gone up in price a lot.   HUB revisited the Ryzen 5000 series last week and included a 12400F on DDR4 and DDR5 for comparison (https://youtu.be/RijAyVshtok?si=NbuCRlSV4uhHOzlv) - the 12400F on DDR4 performs closer to an R5 5500 nowadays than the R5 5600 it used to compete with.,Neutral

Intel,"What? A lot of the review coverage for the 6500XT was about how bad the PCIe bottleneck is. The 6400 and 6500XT are unique in that they’re PCIe x4, even current lower-end cards like the Arc B570 and RTX 5050 are PCIe x8  https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-pci-express-scaling/28.html TPU saw a 24% drop from 4.0 to 3.0 at 1080p  https://www.techspot.com/review/2398-amd-radeon-6500-xt/ Techspot saw a 22% drop in averages and 25% drop in lows from 4.0 to 3.0 at 1080p   I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s even worse nowadays, games demand more VRAM now than they did 4 years ago. More VRAM the card doesn’t have = higher PCIe bandwidth need = more bottleneck when you don’t have bandwidth  A cheap upgrade like an R5 3600 + B550 board would not only improve CPU performance substantially coming from an old 4c4t CPU, but give the GPU the PCIe 4.0 it needs.  If you don’t know what you’re talking about, don’t comment lol",Negative
Intel,"Yes, I’m not stupid.  You are far better off going for Zen 3 over anything on LGA 1700.   The R5 5600(X) performs as well with DDR4 as the 12400(F) does with DDR5.  Used they both go for ~$100-120, new both are ~$170 right now. AM4 boards tend to be cheaper and the RAM is the exact same.  Why would you spend more on LGA 1700 to get worse performance?",Neutral
Intel,"My real-world experience with low-end cpu power and this mismatch on those titles is 10%. It isnt worse than having that i3 does to cpu-bound situations. Upgrading a bad platform is probabaly not his best price to dollar, but it is the nuanced situation he's in. if he can sell what he has for the price it goes for, going ryzen is always correct. However his cpu and all the others here are bad. If he can simply get a better part price on a single chip, he can get equivalent value from the upgrade compared to going ryzen.",Negative
Intel,You can get an i5 13600k with better performance than a 5800x. Also it is difficult to find the AM4 X3D CPUs these days so the intel route makes sense. He can later upgrade to a 14900k even which no AM4 CPU can match in terms of performance,Positive
Intel,"Weren’t you recommending upgrading to a 9400F?  Sure, the 9100F might be the limiting factor right now, but you’re still gonna hit the same PCIe bottleneck. It’s just gonna be more pronounced.",Neutral
Intel,"13th gen pricing is crap so I’ll use 14th gen for comparison, it’s basically the same  14600KF is $245 new and $180-200 used. It has a 181W PL2 so you need a board with good power delivery to not throttle it, especially if you want an upgrade path. The cheapest DDR4 boards you can get right now that fit the bill are $140.  5800XT is $219 new and $150-170 used. AM4 boards are still cheap, there’s plenty of quality B550s for $100.  Going Intel over AMD would cost at least $60 extra and most of the performance gains you would see using DDR5 on the 14600KF would be wiped out using DDR4",Negative

It helps a lot to understand that budget systems fall within their spec, it is only the highest-end and lowest-end options of this era that stretch the pcie issue... there are cycles of alarmist narritives in all media. That one is old news that likely shouldnt have been printed imo.",Negative

Intel,Youre giving me nothing against the clear narritives youre following over substance of experience with this shitty level of cpu performance.,Negative
Intel,"Do you respect at all the starting position he is in or are u just an advice salesman? Both of our ideas coexist. selling his current pc for more than its worth and just buying a dirt cheap 2nd gen ryzen with a sane gpu for the same money, then upgrading from there is also perfectly correct. That is a similar level of effort to a platform swap, or whatever you would prefer, which is also correct. The only bad advice here wastes more time and money than his original choice of platform already sealed. Also ur just wrong about pcie bottlenecks im pretty sure",Neutral
Intel,"I’m making the reasonable assumption that the person running a 9100F + 6500XT in 2026 doesn’t have a ton of money to spend on upgrades lol  Upgrading the current platform makes no sense without also upgrading the GPU. You can’t get very far with CPU upgrades on an H310 board, anything higher than an i5 is gonna be throttled.   Swapping in a cheap PCIe 4.0 CPU + board like an R5 3600 + B550 will improve both the CPU and GPU performance while not spending a ton of money. It also opens the door to future upgrades to something like an R7 5800XT which will hold up far better with a GPU upgrade.   I gave you multiple reviews showing 20+% losses on PCIe 3.0. That’s not opinion, that’s fact. That loss is going to be the same regardless of how good or bad your CPU is as long as the CPU isn’t the bottleneck.",Negative
Intel,I genuinely wonder what u get living in the idealized world where pcie 3.0 sucks ass below the highest-end 4.0 products and visa-versa. My dad was rly into the ideas of mearsheimer and I luckily biocontained his ass before that fkers gone and made the meme rounds again. You listen to Armand Hammer?,Negative
Intel,"Yea. Your advice is fine and wasnt the target of my statements, I added the last comment as proof I agree a platform swap is a totally good option. He doesnt even need to change his cooler for a 9400f and can then get a normal gpu for a similar value to his current one. This process is much simpler and has the potential to grant equal value if the chip is recieved for a low enough bargain, increasing the chances of finding a dreal given limited time. Do we disagree that we are both good at selling advice? I am still completely debating the validity of your sicituational understanding of pcie bottlenecks in relation to low cpu power circumstances, partially because of ur choice of sources, and ur disintrest in confronting that statement.

Intel,"Honestly there’s no “wrong” GPU to slot in with the rest of your build (although getting something lower tier than the options you stated would probably be a bit of a waste)  The 9800X3D gives you so much headroom that unless you’re going for crazy high FPS @ 1080p (which you’re not), it will be more than enough to pair with any GPU.   I think the 5070 Ti and 9070 XT are the most common “sweet spot” for value/performance atm, but if you ever see a good deal on a 5080 then that’ll obviously be a bit better.   My main word of advice would be, don’t stretch your GPU budget too far at the expense of the monitor. You don’t have to go crazy or anything, but a quality monitor will improve your experience quite a bit more than a few % better performance from the GPU imo",Neutral
Intel,"Without productivity needs, it'll come down to how long you plan on keeping it. If you plan on keeping it for 5 years or less, the 9070 XT if the price is cheaper. If you plan on keeping it for more than 5 years, I'd lean towards the 5070 TI since Nvidia seems to have better long term support.",Neutral

You probably will be fine with either, but that's what turned me off from AMD.

Intel,"thing is the reliability of the 50 series concerns me, lately nvidia is having drivers issues plus the well known power connector love for catching fire",Negative
Intel,"I wouldn’t say it’s a “waste” per se - the 9800X3D outpaces basically every GPU on the market rn (as long as it’s not 1080p). So yea in most circumstances you won’t be stretching it to the limit, but that means you don’t have to think about upgrading it for a longgggg time - and every build always has some limiting factor. With a 9800X3D, it’s just never the CPU lol",Neutral
Intel,"I’ve wondered about this myself, and the longevity would be pretty great",Positive
Intel,"Already got the 9800x3d, I realize I may have gone overkill lol. Probably gonna save for 5080 a this point fuck it",Negative
Intel,"thing is 50 series cards, especially the 70, 80 and 90, like to catch fire cause of the new connector",Negative
Intel,What would you say it has over the 9070xt? The goal here is to only let facts convince me lol,Neutral
Intel,I haven't had much luck with 5080s but recently we tracked down a 5070 ti for my buddy at a local Walmart at MRSP check your local walmarts and best buys and set up some sort of stock alert for nvidia's website and founders cards restocks. In my experience reddit is too slow because by the time you see it they're gone.,Neutral
Intel,If you live near a microcenter I'd regularly monitor their site.  There are also a few discords you can join for free that track stock.,Neutral
Intel,My friend upgraded from a 1080ti to a 5080 just before the holidays last year and he ended up having to sign up for some kinda stock alert system with MSI directly. Worth checking into if that’s what you’re after. General brick and mortar retailers are kinda hit or miss when it comes to personalized alerts for GPU’s IME. (Microcenter being the obv exception.),Neutral
Intel,"Hotstock.io app, I grabbed a 5080 FE from nvidia 2 weeks ago.",Neutral
Intel,nvidia and amd announced a +150% price spike starting this february,Neutral
Intel,"raw power they are basically equivalent   in some titles one it's better than the other, in some they are equal  as the 9070xt costs less i went for that myself  i will not spend 300 euros more for basically 1 to 5% more performance in some scenarios while i'll have same or less in others  if they are equivalent in price in your region go for your personal preference    or if the 5070ti is cheaper go for it",Neutral
Intel,"Hardware unboxed did a comparison in raw and upscaled performance for both the 9070xt and 5070ti. Im very happy with my 5070ti I got at msrp a week ago, especially since 150 bucks wouldnt make a difference to me in 4 or 5 years.",Positive
Intel,"Well, you have a fantastic CPU there.  Yeah, a 5080 will be a perfect pairing and gives you a very high-end PC.  Have fun!",Positive
Intel,I got a FE5090 and immediately undervolted it - no problems in 6 mos of ownership so far.  The plug on the FE model is supposed to be different and less susceptible.   Hope so.,Positive
Intel,"Better tech.. Dlss 4.5, frame gen, better drivers, slightly higher base frame rate. Mainly dlss 4.5 and frame gen. I’d love to go w AMD (I do when it comes to cpu)but they just aren’t at the same level in terms of gpu.",Positive
Intel,"Basically the Nvidia feature suite. FSR4 is good but not as good as DLSS4 and now we have DLSS 4.5 which is another step up.   DLSS frame generation is also better than the counterpart from FSR but many people may not want to use frame generation at all.  If you play any ray traced title, although 9079XT does run these games pretty much as fast as 5070TI, the image quality will be worse than 5070TI because AMD just has way worse ray reconstruction (even the new FSR ray construction exclusive to the new CoD game is still a lot worse than the Nvidia counterpart). 9070XT also performs worse than 5070TI in path traced game.  But I am not sure about things like driver stability. I know it is something AMD had been accused a lot in the past but from my own experience the driver for GeForce 50 series at June/July last year was downright horrible, like games literally freeze at unacceptable occurrences. It has been largely fixed at this point but some of the issue remains. Like forcing anisotropic filtering on still causes artifacts in many games",Neutral
Intel,"I don’t know a ton about the current market but I just got a 5070ti a week ago at microcenter and both were at msrp but my understanding is for the extra 150$ (at msrp) you’re paying the nvidia tax ofcourse but other than that slightly better dlss support in games and driver support over the years based off what I’ve read, then frame gen which you certainly don’t need but for me it means I can stretch the life of the card for 2-3 years longer and jump up to 4k if I want to. Native performance is basically identical so really you can’t go wrong between saving money and frame gen I’d say it depends how long and how hard you’re going to be pushing the card.",Neutral

Intel,I do and they have some just above MSRP! Hopefully they still have them by the time I get my tax refund. Cheers!,Positive
Intel,Gotcha. I appreciate the insight!,Positive
Intel,"5070 ti msrp good catch mate, sadly in my country cheapest one 1k euro  honestly i wanted to stay nvidia but i didn't have 1k plus to throw around like that, also if I had gone with the 5070, I’d have needed to change the power supply as mine doesn't have the new power connector",Negative
Intel,"well bro, thing is when a 3k dollar product reliability is subject to dumb luck let's just say it's not worth that much then",Negative
Intel,"I grabbed a 5080 Zotac SOLID CORE right after Christmas and they sold out not long after. I'd keep an eye out for a proper $999 price, hopefully they will restock with no hike.",Neutral

Intel,"no prob, happy to help, don't listen to fanboys that tell you that ""no you have to take this one because is clearly much better"" always go with an objective mind, look at price to performance and at offered features",Positive
Intel,"Keep in mind that if you dont go with nvidia you lose dlss and mfg, which is miles ahead of fsr. While might be almost equal in power id say its worth it because of these free frames with almost zero image quality lost.",Neutral
Intel,Please don’t let this man convince you to get a 9070xt over a 5070ti you will regret it. Frame gen DLSS and Ray tracing are very good now. AMD cards are cope city.,Negative
Intel,"Yeah thats rough, honestly the new amd cards are very valid, Im just an nvidia guy and spending the extra 150 over the 9070xt wouldnt make a difference to me in 4 or 5 years when I upgrade again.",Negative
Intel,Good shout. I gotta wait til I get that refund anyway so fingers crossed,Positive
Intel,"Don’t worry lol, if anything I’m now convinced I should just go big and get a 5080",Neutral
Intel,"bro if you like having a fire hazard in your house plus fake frames go ahead, i'm offering him a realistic choice, if he wanted a budget component he could've gone with the intel arc 580 16gb, a monster of a card for like 300 euros  Nvidia is overpriced and dangerous   Amd is powerhungry and not great for productivity but it's really good for raster performance, and if he plays arc raiders fake frames will only increase latency and worsen his game performance   Intel has questionable drivers because it's a new lineup",Negative
Intel,This is the way,Neutral
Intel,be aware that 50 series card all have the new nvidia power connector that has a big passion of catching fire,Negative
Intel,"AMD is fine but its not better and definitely not at the same price point. 9070xt is worth considering for $560 if 5070ti is $750 but Id still probably rather get the 5070ti. If theyre closer in price its not really a contest outside specific use-cases like games without DLSS/RT, Call of Duty, or if your OS is linux.",Neutral
Intel,"I’ve been worried about that too, what can one even do about this",Negative
Intel,"look mate, in my country the cheapeast 5070ti costs around 1k euro, the 9070xt costs 700ish, cheapest one around 730  you'll excuse me if i don't spend 300 euros more to have a pratically equal product but with the added possibility of burning my house down  cheapest 5080 costs 1.4k and with more risk of catching fire  stop being a fanboy and start being objective, big companies don't care about us consumers but  for the moment the amd card is the better deal if you have a price difference >70 dollars - 60 euros  or if you just want a safe card that doesn't burn your house and you don't need it for productivity",Negative
Intel,"i heard some producers have given color coded cables with their new shipments of 50 series card so if the connector is not perfectly in you will see colors, but i heard that even fully inserted cables sometimes melt, especially with 80 and 90 cards  beside this, you can only pray god  edit: man the fanboys of nvidia are angry, they don't understand that having a fire hazard in the house it's not worth the 1k plus they spend, also they don't understand that defending amd or nvidia will not get you any award, it's not like jensen and his cousin (ceo of amd) will come to your house and give you a free top of the line gpu",Negative

Intel,Get the B580 in my opinion,Neutral
Intel,Had the a770 LE loved it! Wasn’t very powerful considering the specs but it was nice to see Intel actually putting effort in the Gpu space. I would personally go with the B580,Positive
Intel,Yup. Also does media processing very very good.,Positive
Intel,"Neat, such a shame motherboard manufacturers really dont like to give secondary PCIe slots x8 lanes.  This bodes well for intel card users that might upgrade in the future, me personally, I'd like to run this one in a dual setup with a 5070ti or 5080, if those ever become cheap again (lol, probably not).  Cool stuff mate.",Positive
Intel,"I currently run 2 gpus (6800xt and 3060 12G). I use the AMD for most things and the 3060 for image and video generation in comfy ui. I also have 5 displays so both cards have displays hooked up. I tried Ubuntu a few months back and both x11 and Wayland had major issues with the dual gpu setup. I’m currently planning to put the comfy ui stuff on my server (strix halo) and remove the NVidia card to try Bazzite, but that’s still a bit of a ways off.  Power consumption isn’t great. It uses a lot of power sitting on the windows desktop (~400W) and about another 150W in Ubuntu on the desktop.   My recommendation would be if you’re going to use dual gpu for anything, stick to one brand and make sure your motherboard PCIE supports it correctly.",Neutral
Intel,"I'm running an rx7800xt and a b570 (previously an acr a310 eco as secondary) and i gotta say the performance increase was phenomenal, my total power draw is actually down while still playing on ultra settings, and temps are stable.",Positive
Intel,"throwing in that the taichi aqua z890 is excellent for 2 cards, both at pcie5 8x",Neutral
Intel,"One interesting thing to note is that even if you have enough PCIE 8/16x slots, if your CPU can’t handle that many lanes then the chipset will take the rest, and that will reduce speeds a good bit. Even if it doesn’t have to bifurcate the lanes. It’s ok for storage, but not ideal for GPUs. Like for example an Intel 12700k has 20 PCIe lanes that it can support directly, so after that, everything else is done on the chipset.",Neutral
Intel,"I feel you on the bus bandwidth issue. There are so many old cards like RAID controllers and 10GB+ networking gear that use PCI-E 8x. I'd rather have a second 16x or 8x slot than a bunch of m.2 slots.   I wouldnt even mind paying a bit more for extra IO, but it feels like the prosumer workstation tier died off years ago. You either spend hundreds on a motherboard or you get whatever $99 board is on sale.",Negative
Intel,"Just a thought, you can use that Intel card as your dedicated frame gen card with the Lossless Scaling application on Steam. I haven't done it myself but I've seen several videos testing it and it looks like it works great!",Positive
Intel,"I've run dual gpu (albeit same brand) on multiple systems, and the result is mixed. In some games like E33 where parry timing is crucial, the moderate frame gains can be overshadowed by the perceptible latency. And god forbid you alt/tab, sometimes the frame gen would freeze on a certain frame and can only recover by turning scaling off and back on. For gaming it wasn't as game changing as I hope it would've been.   Though I should mention dual gpu for creative softwares is definitely a nice gain, I've set the windows graphics settings to use 1 gpu for premiere and 1 gpu for photoshop/lightroom, and it does speed up the workflow for both.",Neutral
Intel,"Do you currently have your monitors plugged into your main gpu? As far as I know, for the LS setup, you want to have displays connected to your secondary gpu at all times and set your games to run off the main.  This skips the need for main gpu having to transfer data to secondary and back.",Neutral
Intel,"Yup, pretty much my experience as well. I have a 3080 and a spare 2060.  I actually managed to get to a net positive outcome rendering the hard frames at 1080p and outputting through the 2060, but the amount of unnecessarily fiddling that requires is absolutely not worth the somewhat better framerate and painfully obvious worse latency.  My 2060 is back to collecting dust.  note: I had zero driver issues mixing different generations",Negative
Intel,"I hadn't heard of this, but also interesting that I have a proper X8/X8 board (Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master X3D). The other question is does Lossless Scaling work with the integrated GPU on the CPU like the Ryzen's typically have?",Positive
Intel,"I have a X870 TUF Gaming and it has 2 16 PCIe slots, one is PCIe5, the other is PCIe4. Still AM5 though and it was around 230 bucks.  So you don't need to spend 1500 bucks on a motherboard.  Edit: I just checked on Amazon and the Taichi is 300 bucks. Where did you get that $1500 price from?",Neutral
Intel,What an absolute stupid idea. If this is/was a thing there would be many many dual GPU systems reusing old GPUs around.  Surprise! There are none.,Negative
Intel,"From what I know it is not a problem coming from the motherboard. This CPU only has 24 PCIe lanes, it is far from enough to get 2 PCI ports at 16x and a nvme at 4x. The only way was to use the discontinued HEDT platform was offering that, with chipset like X299 adapted to i9-10980XE and its 48 lanes.  If you still need some additional PCIe lanes, you can use a Xeon W9 on W790 platform and you will have 112 PCIe lanes 5.0...",Neutral
Intel,Totally agree.,Neutral
Intel,"From testing different set ups, it is better to use different manufacturers unless you're using two gpus from the same generation (3090+3060, 6800+6600, etc). I've tested a few set up of just amd and Nvidia, and it only works if it's the same generation. You can't reliably run a 30 and 10 series. You can't run a 7000 with a rx580. ... Well you can, but you may have to mess around with older drivers and such.",Neutral
Intel,"Thank you for advise. I chose two different brands because most of the materials about dual gpu contain a combination of two different brands. Some even say that in this way you can use the advantages of both brands of video cards. For example, good performance from AMD and better codec from Nvidia or Intel.",Positive
Intel,"You dont have enough lanes to run 2 16x slots on consumer CPUs anyway. And with 16+8 you wouldnt have enough for a single NVME drive.  Most of the older ""slower"" expansion cards run fine on the chipset slots.",Neutral
Intel,"Please read the post first)  >The whole frame generation idea(Lossless Scaling) slammed into the x4 bus bottleneck.

Intel,That makes sense too. I doubt there is much support for dual drivers from a single manufacturer.,Negative
Intel,"Yep, it's a shame that Threadripper didn't just stay at the high end level, but it went full pro and out of reach entirely.",Negative
Intel,"The bandwidth is there to use older gen PCI-E 8x cards, its just cheaper not to provide the physical PCI-E 8x traces.   My old Highpoint 2720 SAS controller or Intel 10GBE cards definitely take a hit running at 4x. I guess depreciation of older gen stuff is inevitable but I wish somebody offered a secondary 8x slot for a decent price.",Neutral
Intel,"I skimmed it, no one is going to read all that. Everything I saw was focused on encoding.  Lossless Scaling 2x frame gen works great for me with no perceptible lag in any game I tried.",Positive
Intel,Can you share your Lossless Scaling settings?,Neutral
Intel,"Lmao that dude is an ignorant fuck. For the record, I have the same issues as you. 3070 running on an x4 bus, if I try to use lossless scaling it halves my fps, introduces lag, screen tearing, makes it unplayable.",Negative

Intel,thats really reasonable,Neutral
Intel,At least it's not the UE5 engine.,Neutral
Intel,forza is one of the best optimized games ever made,Positive
Intel,"Not bad really. But then again, what do they consider playable?",Negative
Intel,"I mean that seems pretty fair. I'd say you can get a pretty good idea of what they consider ""minimum"" once they release the recommended system requirements. If it jumps all the way up to like a 3080 or something then you know their idea of ""minimum"" is barely playable.",Neutral
Intel,"Considering theyre requiring a 16xx gpu...the game isnt going to use rtx or lumen for the lighting by default. Those two things alone will kill frames. Also consider how many special effects they are expecting to go off at a time compared to something like a fps...smoke...thats about it. Alos, since its a racing game and the expectation is that people are going to go by everything at 150mph, they dont have to be tedious about texture sizes too much on anything other than cars.   Sure they can add settings (and probably will) for all that, but its a 16xx with fsr will run this well enough at 1080p. When you look at most games, the reason their minimum requirements are anything more than a 10xx or 16xx is because theyre using rtx and lumen by default. Also when you look at most games recommended setting, its usually 1440p with rtx and that does require quite a bit better card. But as far as straight raster at 1080p, a 1080ti is still (rip driver support) more than capable...especially since you can run fsr3 on it if you need a fps boost.  So tldr, its probably not that its optimized as much as they arent requiring rtx for lighting.",Negative

Intel,"I have both. When it comes to production work loads Nvidia is still king, however, if you are just concerned about gaming, go with AMD.",Positive
Intel,"Between those two cards I would definitely go with the 9070xt especially if you only play CS2.    The main benefit of the 5070 is the quality of DLSS, but the 12gb are such a negative, that I would go with the 9070xt especially since CS2 runs good enough to not need any upscaling.    For very popular games like CS2 AMD drivers are not an issue, if you play some very niche games or use some CAD software then Nvidia might be the better choice.   Regardless of which one you choose you should buy as soon as possible as prices are increasing very quickly.",Positive
Intel,You only play cs2?   What ever is cheaper dude. You will be maxing any monitor you own with both of those cards lol,Neutral
Intel,Keep in mind CS is also CPU-bound game and in 1080p you better have a good cpu to get high fps. Yes at 1080p the 5070 looks better. At 2k you will see the 9070xt performs better.,Positive
Intel,Cs2 1080p is not a good benchmark tool,Negative
Intel,"I do not understand the other comments, the 5070 is for your usecase likely better since you are only playing CS2, which neither needs more then 12GB VRAM or equal. The used value of the 5070 will likely also hold better then the 9070XT.  According your benchmark above you have 10% more FPS with the 5070 in the game you \*\*only play\*\*.",Neutral
Intel,"As a 5070 owner who recently upgraded to a 9070 XT, I’d highly recommend the 9070 XT. It has more VRAM, more overall performance (9070 XT is roughly equal to, though ever so slightly weaker than the 5070 Ti), and stronger native processing. The 5070 does have DLSS 4 and 4.5 (which are more widely available than FSR 4), but there’s not much else to sway me back.",Positive
Intel,AMD is the way to go if you’re at all interested in moving away from Windows towards Linux at any stage.,Neutral
Intel,"If you currently use, or plan to use, Linux then go with the 9070XT, if not then it pretty much comes down to a bunch of personal preference questions, I especially don't think that extra 4gb of vram is likely to do much for CS2, though I could be wrong as I haven't played since it replaced CS:GO.  That said, I have a personal hatred for Nvidia so I would suggest the 9070XT if you were to directly ask me :P",Neutral

Intel,Get a 1440p monitor,Neutral
Intel,"CS player here. TLDR:  * If you play on 4:3 aspect ratio, **it literally doesn't matter pick the cheaper card** * If you play on 16:9 or 16:10, then go for the 9070XT.   Explanation: (I'm assuming you have a good CPU and a 144hz monitor at least.)  In terms of raw raster power, which is mostly what is required in a badly optimized game like CS2, the 9070XT shines. You will notice a consistently ""smoother"" gameplay when gaming at higher resolutions since those 1% lows will hit hard and often ingame. In my experience the frequent drops in fps are mostly what affects performance and responsiveness, and why CS2 feels sluggish and inconsistent sometimes.       If however you're gaming at 4:3 the extra VRAM will not matter as you will consistently have more than 144 fps in any scenario, which matches your monitor's refresh rate (or 240 fps if you have a good cpu and a higher refresh monitor). So 5070 and 9070XT will have the same performance at 4:3 aspect ratio.  For what it's worth, I have the 5070 and my main game is CS2, no issues whatsoever at 4:3 1280x960. I also play other games at 1440p most at Max/High settings with no issues whatsoever. The 5070 is more than enough for your needs imo.",Neutral

Intel,"Intel is a new discrete card vendor, AMD's driver issue story is a decade old, even then it was overstated (I ran a HD7870 in 2022 still). Sure there were issues, but so had nvidia,like how vr was a stuttery mess for like a year recently. If it's not a typo and you mean 5070 not ti, it's not even up to debate I believe, AMD all the way. Solid cards, more vram, ray tracing has closed significantly, and linux support is night and day, I switched on nvidia recently which had some annoyances, since going 9070XT it's pretty much plug and play gaming. I don't think dlss is worth the hype, sure it can be better than TAA, but only because TAA is dogshit, and yeah nvidia is kind of a step ahead, but AMD does keep up. I picked a 4070 before this thinking dlss and rt and reflex is worth it, and felt disappointed by the end, sure they are alright, but not a big deal at all, or something I'd use in the first place given the choice.",Negative
Intel,"9070xt, incase if u wanna switch to linux.  As AMD works out of the box with Vulkan on linux.",Neutral
Intel,"that 12gb vram wont cut it  trust me, new unoptimize slop keeps pumping out of the UE oven and you need those extra vram",Negative
Intel,how are people picking a 5070 over a 9070 XT? Like the benchmark show everything is better on a 9070 even one that isn’t an XT. Are people just at blind to being fanboy of Nvidia?,Negative

Intel,"I remember 1.5 years ago I was in a similar position choosing between 7900 GRE and 4070 Super for primarily CS2 and secondary GTA V.  The comparison videos I saw pointed hard towards 4070 Super in CS2 in terms of - FPS, temperature and power consumption. Made the choice easy for me. For GTA, it was very similar so didn’t make a difference. I recommend checking YouTube benchmarks for the exact game you want to use the GPU for, don’t go with what a generalistic FPS comparison across games or with what other users tell you (because they might be playing very different games than you).  (I play 1440p 165 Hz with G-sync on, meaning locked to 158 FPS).",Neutral
Intel,The answer is staring at you.,Neutral
Intel,"Had/have both. The 5070 was fine, but as soon as I found a 9070XT at a great price in March of last year, I sold that Zotac 5070 Solid to a friend.  Hate to say it, but ultimately, I looked at the plugs, kept seeing issues with users having that cursed 12VHPWR fail. I also considered that even with a SFX power supply (my case is a T1 v2.5), there was still plenty of open connections to feed the extra 8+2 ports of the particular ASUS Prime OC 9070XT 16GB that I swapped to. Cable routing was more inconvenient.  Sold it to a friend that didn't care about all that. He got a card right after his older card died, and I was able to move onto the card I really was targeting (bought the 5070 in February).  If my purpose/wishes required a 5080 or even 5090, then I might have taken my chances long-term on relying on that 12VHPWR as a necessary evil/risk. Seeing as the 9070XT can compete with the 5070TI, but use the more proven power connector design, I would choose the more reliable option.",Neutral
Intel,Between these two cards the 9070xt for me. More VRAM and nvidia don't really compete with this card without dlss. I recently purchased a 5070ti because I wanted the dlss and 16gb for work but with your stated use case buy the 9070,Neutral
Intel,Buy both,Neutral

Intel,>The price is the same btw  I find it borderline impossible but if price is indeed the same then pick way better card which is 9070 XT.  5070 Ti for the same price of course but not 5070 non-Ti.,Neutral
Intel,"Depends on what you want? For gaming only take the AMD. If you want to do something else that requires Cuda cores, take the Nvidia. It's that simple.  I personally took 5070ti, because I need it for CFD, but otherwise I would have taken 9070 XT Nitro+",Neutral
Intel,"Are you intending to play at max settings? Do you have an AM5 X3D CPU?   Because realistically, there shouldn't be any difference between the two graphics cards for CS2 otherwise, as you'll be entirely CPU limited.   Benchmarks like TPU use max settings to show the scaling between graphics cards, which is good for benchmarks as otherwise they would just be measuring the CPU, but is effectively turning CS2 into a synthetic test.",Neutral
Intel,"Neither one is needed for CS2. Whatevery you have now, is probably still fine for CS2.",Neutral
Intel,Only reason i went for the 5070 was cause i had an G-sync screen. Other than that i’d buy the cheapest.,Neutral
Intel,Depends on fsr4 support.,Neutral

Intel,"i would go for the 5070. It has the better feature set, if u are interested to use them in other games beside cs. If you just want to play cs, go for the amd one and enjoy a few more bucks in your wallet.",Positive
Intel,"9070xt is far superior to vanilla 5070 and more future proof due to the extra ram  5070ti on the other hand is the slightly superior card, but if the price difference between it and a 9070xt is more than, let's say 100 bucks, not worth it imo.",Positive
Intel,"If they are the same price or in a similar priceclass I'd go 9070XT it is comparative to a 5070ti, I primarily play RPG's on 1440p and I get around 140fps on games like KCD2.  If a 5070 is much cheaper you may wanna consider it depending on your budget, but you get a comparatively worse GPU with 12GB Vram.  That said if you can get a 5070ti for the same price or at least within 100-150 bucks of a 9070XT i'd consider that.  But between the 5070 and 9070XT, 9070XT all the way.",Neutral

Intel,"The RX 9070 XT is faster than even the RTX 5070 Ti in CS2 with current day drivers. If that's all you play and you don't do any other work with your GPU, buy it",Positive
Intel,"If you going to buy 5070, i would recommend to buy the TI version instead of the regular one. If you are on a tight spot with budget, go with the 9070 XT, while the 5070 has 12 Gigs, the 9070 XT has 16 Gigs. YES the 5070 is also a bit cheap but at that point i would rather go with the 9070 XT.",Neutral
Intel,"If you genuinely only play CS2, it doesn’t matter which one you get. I doubt you will notice the extra FPS if you don’t run the counter. The extra 4GB would definitely be useful for down the road or other games and I have not had any driver issues with mine, but cannot guarantee your experience will be the same.   If you do choose Nvidia, I would suggest the ti for the extra VRAM. Understand as well that some people do still have driver issues. Due to the nature of the internet and fanboyism, I really couldn’t tell you if it is actors frequent or not. It may have to do with specific settings or configurations. But positives. The game you claim you play exclusively is optimized for Nvidia as you can see by the performance boost. Nvidia software and features are indeed more robust and proven. They are at least one generation ahead of AMD with RT, PT and upscaling tech. Don’t bother with frame generation in CS2 it adds input lag.   In short go with the one that fits your budget that you have enough confidence in. It will be in your system. Most people here will pick one brand or the other and try to say it is the only choice. That isn’t true. Both have pluses and minuses, you need to decide which one is more positive to you.",Neutral
Intel,"Walmart still has the PNY 5070’s at MSRP and some locations (US) have been clearance sales at an even bigger discount. I have no idea what AMD pricing looks like - last batch of Red I tempted my patience and fate with  was a pair of 6970’s in crossfire.   I would say get what makes the most logical, supportive, and financial sense for you, OP. Green has my vote tho.",Neutral
Intel,But it doesn’t seem to be better according to that benchmark? The 5070 seems to get 30 more FPS. If you only play CS2 and that game performs better on The 5070 it seems like a no brainer.,Negative
Intel,"Both options are kinda overkill if you'll only going to be playing CS2 on it, unless you want to play at 4K or something. That said, the better option is whichever you find cheaper, which is most likely going to be the 9070XT. At the same price, I'd go with the 9070 XT.  Both GPUs perform at a similar level, with variations depending on the game. In general, the 9070 XT performs slightly better, sitting in between the RTX 5070 and the RTX 5070 Ti. But there are specific cases in which the 9070 XT can fall below both, and others where it can rise above both.  The main actually notable advantage of the 9070 XT is the higher VRAM capacity.  The main actually notable advantage of the RTX 5070 is DLSS being better than FSR.  AMD drivers haven't been a concern for this generation, and in fact, Nvidia drivers have done a lot worse since the beginning of last year.",Neutral
Intel,You need 400 fps for cs2?,Neutral
Intel,"Depends on pricing the 5070 has better performance on paper but getting one at MSRP is kinda hard, the 9070xt is a good card with solid performance and is easier to get at MSRP (at least near me).",Positive
Intel,"If on Linux and it is the same price, go with AMD. But always look at price and go with the cheaper option",Neutral
Intel,"If theyre the same price I would grab the 9070 just because I dont trust that particular websites benchmarks.    But if you do and the game you play does much better with the NVidia card just buy that one! Just make sure you check more sources, just in case. If they play similar I would go for the one with more vram",Neutral
Intel,"Different perf, different price. Depend on your budget.",Neutral
Intel,"In my experience, 9070xt is really good performance. But AMD Adrenalin soft is hell, drivers are bugged, it bothered me so much.   So I bought a brand new 5070 Ti the same price I paid for 9070XT day one in March and sold my 9070xt for 700€",Positive
Intel,Trust me get that 9070xt if you got the money the drivers aint bad anymore and watch a gaming conparison video between them,Negative
Intel,"I see it this way:   Have an amd CPU? Get the 9070xt.   Have a Intel CPU? Get the 9070xt.   I do not have any first hand experience with the 5070ti. But I now have 6 friends in my gaming group that are running 9070xts, myself included, and we are all very happy with them. All of us also have ryzen x3d cpu's of one generation or another, and 3 of us come from Intel/Nvidia rigs before this.   I can say one thing: power consumption is way, way, way down and those 1% lows are oh so sweet and good.   I will probably get a 9850x3d and maybe that new phantomlink board and GPU. Idk. It's that or a couple of guns with the coming tax money.",Positive

Intel,amd 16 GB cards. no brainer if you play on 1080p and competitive games it's the best value.,Positive
Intel,"The 9070XT is better than the 5070 To on average, often getting within a few fps of a 5080.  And compared to Nvidia cards right now, AMD can often be had much cheaper.",Positive
Intel,If u are a happy nvidia user rn and don’t want issues with drivers go with 5070 trust me… i also heard a lot of good things about amd gpus and went for rx 5700 in my previous pc and the drivers and especially amd adrenaline overlay were driving me insane… luckily i switched to rtx 5070 now and it works just as i remember nvidia things work - just perfect,Positive
Intel,I have the 9070xt and I love it. My last card was a gtx1080.   I'm all about value and for me the 9070xt was £150-£200 cheaper than the equivalent Nvidia card. If it had been the other way them I would have got the Nvidia card. Prices are all over the place ATM though so check around for deals. My card has gone from £550-£650 since I got it.,Positive
Intel,"Buy the 5070 for CS2 at 1080p if that's your focus, and accept the trade-offs if and when they become an issue later on.  Personally, I got the 9070xt because I play at 4k mostly and thus need the horsepower/vram, and the 5070ti was 20% more at the time.  Both will be good - the 9070xt is going to be better bang for the buck broadly, but certain applications/usages still favour nvidia.",Neutral

Intel,"9070xt over 5070, 5070ti over 9070xt but the 300-500€ higher Ti.. is it really worth it? If you want ray tracing and dlss then maybe if you have extra cash for it, but since you play CS2 those won't even matter. I have 9070xt and I have no regrets buying it.",Neutral
Intel,"9070xt.  Why care about dlss4.5 when the 9070xt can bruteforce the difference? And it has more vram, it's a no brainer at around the same price.  With that being said, buy a 2060 or something like that, chances are that it will be more than enough for cs2.   In my experience, the whole thing of bad AMD drivers must be either in the past, or the cope of a bunch of famboys, it just works as good as nvidia, in my case, it's even better, as the nvidia driver is a pos and generates some stutters in SteamVR for no reason",Neutral

I don't give a shit about brands I give a shit about reality of features and that's why I say Nvidia is where it's at currently for GPUs just as AMD are the clear winners in the CPU space. 5070Ti is more comparable (and better) than a 9070xt though, 5070 it becomes more questionable.  Who cares for your use case though it's absolutely ridiculous.",Positive
Intel,Reddit AMDcirclejerk will always tell you AMD. It's a cult.,Neutral
Intel,I’ll sell you my old shitty card that still clocks 180fps on CS2 if you want.  If you’re only playing CS2 you barely need to think about what GPU to buy lol.,Neutral
Intel,Get a 9070xt I got mines at micro center for 599 msrp,Neutral
Intel,Ich hab the 5070 and switched to the 9070xt. It was a nice improvent,Positive
Intel,"If it’s for CS2 only then neither, you should be looking raw horsepower which the 7900XTX has in abundance over both of those cards.",Neutral
Intel,"I bought a 5070 FE used from a good friend who used it one week and decided he wanted something more powerful. He ended up with one of those Doom 5080s and sold me the 5070 below msrp and ebay prices for used. I love it, it is defiantly the nicest card I've had the chance to own.",Positive
Intel,Whatever you get cheaper and/or faster (from a good source),Positive
Intel,Id always default to Nvidia. Rock solid.,Neutral
Intel,"If performance in a single game is so important, you should probably look up performance on the latest drivers as things change over time and reviews aren't updated to reflect this.  This is exactly the reason why it's a bad idea to based comparisons on a single game.  The 9070 XT has higher overall performance as reviews show, which means it's entirely possible a driver or game update pushes it's performance above the 5070.  Plus I don't know a single person that ended up only playing a single game on their GPU over it's life.",Negative
Intel,9070 plain. XT gives you 10% more performance for 20% more money and 30% more power draw. Bad deal for a marginal improvement.,Negative
Intel,Damn I have finally reached the point where my card isn’t on these charts. Guess it’s time to make a new build!,Negative
Intel,"It seems like both those cards are overkill for what you're doing, why not a 9060XT 16GB or the equivalent nvidia?",Negative
Intel,"If you're truly only going to play cs2, the 9070xt is only 5% faster at 1440p according to hardware unboxed's testing with a 9800x3d. With any other CPU, they'll perform identically.   The 9070 XT is the better card, but not for cs2. I don't get why everyone's missing that point in the comments",Neutral
Intel,"For  same price 9070xt, it's a no brainer, more rasterization power and more VRAM, it competes with the 5070ti. CS2 probably needs some sort of update, those numbers don't add up. Drivers in AMD are pretty stable just make sure to use DDU to uninstall any nvidia driver in safe mode or flat out format your hard drive (that's what i did).",Positive
Intel,"I used to play CS2 before I got BF6... It's great for it, on a 300hz 1440p screen getting about 450fps. Never had a driver issue at all on CS2, it will be more than fine.",Positive
Intel,"just get whatever one you have the best deal on, everyone crashing out over dlss vs fsr but that doesn't even matter when you have 400fps at native res",Neutral
Intel,"I am a 5070 user and I really enjoy perks like first access to the new upscaling models -- DLSS 4.5 -- and (the previously exclusive to NVIDIA GPUs) in-home game streaming with Moonlight. That said, I also really find myself wishing that I had 4 more GB of VRAM. You need to be careful not to saturate it because it will bork up your framerate and you will need to reset your game to fix it.",Positive
Intel,"I have a 4070 and it works great for cs2 at 1440p 240hz. the 5070 is a little better, so it's very good. if you have like a 360hz+ monitor than I'd say 9070xt, it definitely has much more raw performance than the 5070, and that's exactly what you want for a competitive shooter. If you want to save some money, or don't need that kind of power, 5070 is just fine",Positive
Intel,"If you're looking just to have a nice card, Nvidia has been stocking the the 5070 founders on their site for $550. The 9070xt is $200 more, so it's not a comparison. the 5070ti though? I'd probably do the 9070xt because the games you play can nearly run on integrated graphics.",Neutral
Intel,"I’m going to say this, AMD drivers have been a little rough for the past 6 months. 25.10.1, 25.11.1, 25.12.1 and the yesterday unveiled 26.1.1 all have issues in some games on windows. I’m talking driver timeouts, lower utilization, wrong clock speeds. It’s been rough, but I won’t fully blame AMD. The fact of the matter is I get 50-60 fps more in a lot of titles on Linux and zero crashes. My SO has a 5070 and on most of the games we play she makes 50~ fps less than me (sometimes even more). But on windows that can drop to 30 or even 20. Regardless the 9070xt is more powerful. Make sure to reinstall windows fresh, and update to 26.1.1. So far on this new driver I’ve had zero crashes on windows.",Negative

Intel,9070 XT v 5070 Ti  9070 v 5070  Those are the GPUs to compare,Neutral
Intel,I got some bad news for you. You arent getting 300fps in MHW lol.  Pay for VRAM not the name...  Edit: Ahhh missed the edition vs actual game... reguardless. Buy the VRAM not the name. And consider whatever is your weakest link behind the GPU. No sense in buying a 5090 if you loooove your 60hz 720p monitor,Negative
Intel,12GB VRAM is the minimum for 1440P. Get a GPU with 16GB to be safe,Neutral
Intel,"If you're doing Windows, Nvidia, and if you're doing Linux, AMD.",Neutral
Intel,"5070 all day, or 5070 Ti for the extra few bucks. No driver headaches, no issues, just works, and works much better.",Positive
Intel,I'll pick the 9070xt over the 50xx every day of the week.  I would much rather have the battle tested 8 pin power connectors any day over a 10%-25% FPS gain (that I literally cannot perceive).,Negative
Intel,"I bought the 9070xt a month ago. Got a good price ($560). Sold my 3070 for $250 so net cost was pretty low. Benchmarks are full 2x improvement pretty much. I have no complaints although make sure you safe mode ddu. First time I didn’t do safe mode and stuff was crashing constantly.   I was researching constantly and it had the best ROI at the time.   If you want to do any AI at any point, or a bunch of encoding, maybe go Nvidia. Latter maybe a point of argument but it always outperforms AMD for me",Positive
Intel,9070xt i think the drivers been good lately,Positive
Intel,"So happy to see my 3090 is still competitive (kind of). Raw power is better with the 9070xt, but software features makes the 5070 an easy choice.",Positive
Intel,9070xt all day. Imo. I had the same debate almost a year ago and ended up getting a 7900xtx for $700. I still think i made the right decision.,Positive
Intel,I would not buy a 12GB Gpu in 2026.     So its either 5070 Ti or 9070 XT,Neutral
Intel,I would go with the 9070 non XT if it saves you more money since the XT isnt worth it,Neutral
Intel,"If all you're playing is CS2 at 1080p, either card is probably overkill.  You'd be fine with a 9060 XT (even 8GB), and it would be a whole lot cheaper.  Or if you want to stick to Nvidia, a 5060 or 5060 Ti.  Unless you're playing at elite levels of competition, the difference between 300fps and 400fps is pretty academic.",Neutral
Intel,i vote 16GB vram. but seems like you are updating often so maybe don’t  have to worry about longevity.  but counterpoint if you want good drivers i think nvidia is better supporter of drivers for their cards.,Neutral
Intel,With the recent update in Nvidias DLSS i would get the 5070ti for msrp. if you still can.   Or its the 9070xt for sure.,Neutral
Intel,Never be dumb enough to buy amd,Negative
Intel,Glad I got my 4080s for retail before the 50 cards came out,Positive

Intel,nvidia for dlss,Neutral
Intel,dont forget about the nvidia rtx 4090 64gb titan card ai slop edition,Negative
Intel,If it's 5070 ti then 100% worth it. 5070 over 9070xt is only worth it if you need ray tracing or you work with 3D software like blender or any video editing software...even obs. Nvidia is much better in performance for those.,Positive
Intel,Get the GPU that is more optimized for your game.,Neutral
Intel,If you only ever plan on playing counter strike then yes 5070 is what you want if however you thinking about playing any other game the 9070 / 9070xt is worth it depending on pricethe 9070 is slightly faster the 9070xt much more so its just not at counter strike.,Neutral
Intel,Why does one need 400fps in cs2?? If that's all i played I'd still rock a 1080,Neutral
Intel,"From personal experience, the 5070 is the better esports card. 9070XT is the better AAA card.",Positive
Intel,5070 TI,Neutral
Intel,Either get 5070ti or 9070xt just look at games you wanna play and compare fos,Neutral
Intel,"What PSU are you using?  The 9070xt draws 400w at peak so if you are getting a 12hpwr connector card, make sure to get the voltage protector board by TG or Aqua.   My research took me from the 5070 to the XT to the 5070ti.  1. Ram on the first jump 2. Power on the second jump. The AMD does draw 50 to 60% more, putting the connector into a higher risk category for burn out. I was also limited by the PSU and didn't want to undervolt.  If you get a 12hpvwr over voltage protection board, and you have the PSU bandwidth. The 9070xt is an easy choice. As others have said, Linux.....and SteamOS.  Good luck!",Neutral
Intel,"I was deciding between these two, then got a 5070Ti for almost the same price on some luck, and haven't regretted anything. I thought I was gonna switch to a ""red"" GPU, but this is my 3rd Nvidia GPU and haven't been let down even once yet (knock on wood)",Positive
Intel,"Get whatever is cheaper, which probably would be 9070. What problems are you expecting playing only cs2? Besides, AMD driver issues is now thing of the past - thing of the present is both AMD and NVidia driver issues. And AMD and Intel CPU microcode issues. And SSDs randomly dying because of shitty OS update.  Everything's shit, and also expensive. So, pick whatever is cheaper, you'd have some issues either way. Or not. But vendors do not matter much.",Negative
Intel,"CS2's optimization isn't particularly friendly to AMD graphics cards. I recommend sticking with NVIDIA cards instead.  But, both of these cards offer more than enough performance. It ultimately comes down to whether you have productivity needs. If you require model training and CUDA acceleration, then the 5070 is undoubtedly the better choice.",Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, if the 5070 plays the games you like better then get a 5070  but if it's pretty close get the 9070xt as it will be overall better in most games",Positive
Intel,Who told you that 9070XT would have more driver issues? I have come across far more from my customers using nvidia cards now with severe issues,Negative
Intel,Go with a 9070xt. I have mine since they release and no issue. For the driver part the issue was with older generation,Neutral
Intel,DLSS > FSR,Neutral
Intel,"Unless it’s the Ti, get the 9070xt. 5070 ti is superior though",Positive
Intel,"For that price/performance range, just get a 9070xt. It's way better than 5070 except with maybe ray tracing. If you can find a 5070ti at or near MSRP, though, get that.",Positive
Intel,9070xt. Apples to apples is 9070 vs 5070 where the 9070 is still the better gpu.,Neutral
Intel,"I went 5070 BCS cheaper and dlss 4.5 is a better upscaler with wider game support on launch, whereas fsr 4 support gets added late.",Positive
Intel,"If you only play cs2 why get such a good gpu? I mean it'll crush it for sure! Also 9070xt for if you want to play any other games that aren't multiplayer, other wise 5070",Positive
Intel,"I just bought a 9070xt and I was tossing up between it and the 5070ti and I'm so glad I went 9070xt  paired with 9800x3d I get 600+ fps at all times on CS (low/medium graphics)  the 9070xt's closest competitor is the 5070ti which is like 1% better unless you care about ray tracing and all that, but it's also $500 AUD more expensive than the 9070xt  I think the 9070xt is the best price-to-performance card you could buy right now (at least in Aus)",Positive
Intel,"Pick AMD and Install Linux, drop the slop and enjoy bug free life. It never failed me once and win 11 bricked the drivers or something for 12 times already so I decided to switch. Frame gen is a massive slop too, helps you get better frames but at a massive cost of motion clarity and input delay. There is no reason to buy Nvidia unless you are working as engineer in AI, Solidworks or Houdini",Positive
Intel,Interesting chart as my 7900xtx at 1080p med/high mix get me 778fps average in the benchmark and in game I'm well over 600 average but this chart shows way less..favoring cards I KNOW aren't doing as well as I also have them,Positive
Intel,9070xt if you only play cs2,Neutral
Intel,"Depends on what you’re after. If you want better ray tracing and DLSS then Nvidia, if you want better price to performance then AMD.  Both cards are perfectly viable CS2 so it really just comes down to what you want",Positive
Intel,Got nvidia and amd here.   9070xt is great for gaming.   If you're doing more than that the perks of nvidia are worth the increased price tag.   Every time.,Positive
Intel,"wtf are these benchmarks results? Outperformed by a 2 generation old 6900XT, what a joke.  Get the damn 5070Ti",Negative
Intel,"The 5070 performs a lot better with Ray-tracing. It has CUDA technology that makes it a lot easier to dabble in AI generation, if you wanna do that.  9070 XT has more Vram though, and will last longer when you consider running the newest games. Although it's the weaker option for ray tracing.  I have the 9070xt and I'm very happy with the choice,  but setting up Stable Diffusion was a bit of a hassle for me.  So there's pros and cons on both sides.  If one is significantly cheaper, I would go with that. They're both great options.",Positive
Intel,For cs2 no other gpu than 5090.,Neutral
Intel,"Dude you play cs2 on 1080p. like seriously , any potato gpu will get you over 200 fps. are you a pro?  get the cheapest GPU.    also, nvidia drivers have been a lot worse than AMD for years now.",Negative
Intel,"i also had ro decide betwen thise 2, went for the 5070because i got doom tda for free with it, others wise i would have gone for the 9070xt, 16gb is pretty nice",Positive
Intel,"I know this wasn't your question, but have you thought of going with the 9060xt? It offers 16gb vram (there is also the 8gb version but I wouldn't get it for an upgrade) and if you're only playing cs you'll get good performance anyway  Edit: I'm only mentioning it as an option because it's considerably cheaper and I believe it would be enough for your use case. If you have the budget and want to go for one of these anyway for the higher performance, I'd go with the 9070xt",Positive
Intel,"screw Nvidia get the 9070xt. I've had mine since launch day (3090ti owner before that) and have had almost no issues beyond the first few weeks when games/drivers were stabilizing to the new hardware. Cost to performance ratio is crazy good, I just wish there was a higher vram option since I do a lot of vrchat.",Positive
Intel,"Right?? Everyone arguing that one card is ‘better’ than the other but we are genuinely talking about 400fps vs 430fps. Wtf is even the point of the whole discussion, this dude probably has a 165Hz monitor or something along the lines.",Negative
Intel,I have a friend who exclusively plays CS on a 1080p 144hz monitor and he just made a completely new build with a 4070 but refuses to get a new monitor lol. So why the fuck spend the money you idiot?!,Negative
Intel,Because 300 FPS isn't enough apparently,Neutral
Intel,is like buying a ferrari to go around your plastic pool    gen z is lost,Neutral
Intel,5070 is cheaper.,Neutral

Intel,"the drivers were ass once, but that was ages ago and they have been pretty good ever since then",Positive
Intel,"I had the same problems, I disabled auto updating with the help of youtube video and now I did not across any  problems in 7 months.",Neutral
Intel,"I think the driver issue comes from people switching from nvidia to AMD. Nvidia drivers behave like malware when you try to uninstall it, leaving  behind files that conflict with hardware from the competition. a lot of people don't know about this, so they don't use DDU (or use it wrong) or flat out nuke the OS.",Negative
Intel,"Oh god, during the Vega days and then the 5000 series days. I ended up returning my launch 5700xt because the drivers were so broken it was just crash after crash after black screen.   I haven't went back to AMD GPUs since but I assume they have gotten miles better.",Negative
Intel,"Just bought a 9070xt and handed down my 3090. I was very worried about AMD driver issues, but it's been solid for me. I'm actually impressed by the metrics and monitoring in Adrenaline.  With Nvidia, I was stuck on a very old driver because newer drivers weren't stable for a couple of my primary games. I went AMD instead of 5070TI because it was a $150 USD price difference.",Positive
Intel,"Same here, and it’s most been great apart from one big ***   Indiana Jones Hidden Circle had several game breaking bugs annoying late in the game.   Other than this, which is very frustrating as I was 30 hours into the game and literally cannot progress past the crash, it is great",Positive
Intel,Also went AMD this time. Drivers have not been an issue and the software auto detected which driver i needed and installed it right away. I had to do nothing.,Negative
Intel,Drivers are still sour with older cards but the last few years it's been pretty solid for their newer ones.,Positive
Intel,"I have also switched to amd after using nvidia since 2013, i did had windows update corrupt/unninstall my video drivers twice, but again, i just did DDU and installed the card, maybe it was exclusively windows fault",Neutral
Intel,"I upgraded my 980ti to a 7900xtx in 2023. I've had 1 issue since then. It was an issue with DirectX12 in WoW and PuBG. The weird part was Dx12 worked in retail wow but was having issues in classic wow, so I think it was more a Blizzard implementation issue than an AMD issue. As for PuBG, idk. Other than that, my experience with AMD has been good. (I had an HD 6950 and a 9800 Pro back in the day, too, and I didn't really have issues either).",Neutral

Intel,also a 9070xt owner. had a few weird stability issues in the beginning but updating fixed them all and irs been smooth sailing after the first month or so. bought it pretty much at launch so some bumps are to be expected. my model is also pretty quiet even on load which is nice.,Positive
Intel,"Funny I had the exact opposite experience coming from 5 years of a 3070 undervolted  First driver I installed in December crashed all the time , I had to find a stable one , but since then, it has been as it was on Nvidia with Shadow Play / Recording while gaming which was relatively stable but sometimes for some reason just didnt resume working after Hibernation.",Negative
Intel,"In my recent experience, it is Nvidia drivers that are terrible. Over the last 4 years, I've never had any driver issues with my 5700xt or 7800xt, but my daughter has had driver issues with both her 2070 and 4070.  She still can't get open GL to work on the 4070.  Everytime I find a way to fix it, it seems to break itself the next day.",Negative
Intel,Go look through the amd sub it’s not nvidia shills trashing amd drivers.  There are so many posts about driver timeouts and black screens still.  The new thing is to buy an open box 9070xt and realizing why it was an open box.,Negative
Intel,He clearly says that he only plays CS2. And the chart clearly shows that the 5070 is better than the 9070XT in that particular game,Positive

Intel,Wait hold up..... I only read the title and didn't know it was for cs2 specifically..... bro its overkill if you're buying a 9070xt or 5070 for cs2 if thats only the one game you play. You can get an rx580 that will do the job or at most a 6600xt since you wont be needing 4k for cs2. 1080p with maximum fps with those cards and anything higher is just a waste of that gpus potential and money unless you play other games at maximum graphics. Plus we need to know what monitor you use too. Do you have a 1080p monitor? A HD 2k monitor? Or a 4k monitor?,Negative

Intel,I was back when the 9070xt was released and cs2 has abysmal performance. They later patched it so now it's good.,Positive
Intel,What? The 9070 XT will easily beat a 5070 in RT outside of Path Tracing (if you're able to fit it into the 5070s VRAM limits). The 9070 XT is straight up better outside of productivity and some Nvidia QOL features.,Positive

Driver issues are vastly exaggerated online and the myth of amd having bad drivers is almost 15 years old now. They were bad but as you said, ages ago. Today nvidia has way more issues with their ai vibe coding (which amd also will have). Stick to the rule as always: Don't update on release day, wait a month at least unless you really have to.",Neutral
Intel,"More importantly, initial drivers for the 5000 series were complete shit. Took months before nvidia improved that.",Negative
Intel,"The peak ""AMD drivers bad"" era was genuinely pushing a decade ago at this point. There were some decently widespread issues with year 1 RDNA2 iirc, I had a day 1 6900XT and had pretty much zero issue personally but I know that's anecdotal. Outside that I feel like AMD driver issues really started tapering off after Polaris launch. I never had any driver issues I couldn't fix with a google search and like 15 minutes effort my entire time with an RX480 8GB and even having to do that was extremely rare.  I'll actually say my HD6950 was annoying to troubleshoot and was a headache at times but also that's a GPU from 2010/2011 and iirc literally part of the first generation of AMD GPUs after the ATI branding got killed. And the entire reason I swapped to it was I also had driver issues with my Fermi architecture Nvidia GPUs so I figured I'd try a Radeon card. Both brands I was having issues with in that era tbh.",Negative
Intel,The drivers were ass before most of the people in this forum were out of diapers and at that time Omega drivers were the preferred option.,Negative
Intel,Yup windows fucks shit up.,Negative
Intel,Weren't there rumours that the reason some people had really bad issues compared to others was because there were some bad batches of the cards themselves? (It was a big proportion of the launch cards if I remember correctly). Can't make claims on the validity but if it was that many it's possible that and would never admit it because they'd have to replace so many,Negative
Intel,Weird. I bought a 5700XT at launch and never had those issues. Kept it running all the way until last month when I upgraded to a 9070XT.,Neutral
Intel,"I dunno about that, searched timeout on the AMD reddit and it returned 1 result in the last 9 years.  I'm sure there are more but you are absolutely misrepresenting the frequency.  The AMD sub actually allows users to post their issues.  On the Nvidia sub, you aren't allowed to outside the one megathread they have for it and even then the mods aggressively delete anything not positive of Nvidia there.    Your open box example is just you trying to craft a story to fit your narrative.  If open box = bad drivers (when it could be dozens of other things), you fail to realize there are in general more open box Nvidia products for sale than AMD (simply through virtual of them selling more cards).  By your nonsense logic, Nvidia's drivers much be bad.",Negative
Intel,"Yes, because no one is gonna post that their drivers are working fine and without issues. You're always gonna see complaint posts because it's why people will post there. For advice.  The Nvidia sub doesn't have it because there's a master list of all issues already available and the fixes for them. AMD doesn't have such a master list on their sub. Also, a lot of issues are labelled as driver faults when they're actually ram instability and CPU issues instead. People don't typically test things themselves.",Negative
Intel,"go to the nvidia sub and they have their own set of problems, go to the ferrari sub and they have problems, go to the banana's sub and they report issues with banana's     all those subs have ppl posting problems.. nobody goes there to say they have 0 problems. you only read complaints on forums.",Negative
Intel,Do you mean amdhelp? It’s a subreddit for AMD Cards and CPUs having issues. Yes people are having issues on there so they post there. I had a problem with a new gigabyte 5070 where it kept black screening and had no where to go. Remember 572.83? Pepperidge farm remembers. I see melting connector post here everyday that must explain all the returned nvidia cards. See how cherry picking works?,Negative
Intel,"1080 > 3070ti > 9070xt here. Never had so many driver crashes before.  It’s not unusable, and I’m still relatively happy(would just get a 5070ti if I could go back in time). The card performs well, but I get a crash like once every few weeks.",Positive

Intel,"The day he steps outside his bubble, he will appreciate going with the card that is a tier above. If the 2 are similar performance, but one plays WAY faster in every other game.... why not buy the tier up, if for nothing more than the longevity and resale down the road?",Positive

Intel,"First, your 70% figure is entirely made-up.  70% of gamers don't even have cards that can accelerate AI upscaling.  Second, the 9700 XT has higher base performance.  The need to upscale is less.  Third, the 9700 XT has more memory, giving the card more longevity.",Neutral
Intel,"To be completely honest I have 9070xt since week after release.   I've had a 1 situation when Windows decided to update Radeon drivers to a Radeon PRO drivers, I was shocked when I saw blue accents in adrenalin instead of red ones.",Neutral
Intel,"I could be misinformed but I think Nvidia did clean their act up in the final quarter of 2025 basically. But absolutely I think some people just glossed over that Nvidia had genuinely terrible drivers fairly consistently for the bulk of 2025. With some of the highlights being the early Blackwell drivers being unstable so the pro strat was using pre-launch drivers from iirc December 2024 that didn't support multi frame gen and maybe DLSS4 in general.  That one specific driver that would set custom fan curves to 0RPM at all temps and cooked multiple GPUs to the point of needing to be RMA'd. Which while it did get hotfixed like a full day later, that was A. still long enough we saw multiple reports of broken cards and B. they weirdly didn't force the update or heavily promote on social media or anywhere to tell people to do the update. So if you were out of loop which some people were, we still saw a few more cooked GPUs drip feed in days after it was fixed.  And the Doom the Dark Ages ""Game Ready Drivers"" that literally in the patch notes first block of text ""Documented crashes when playing Doom the Dark Ages"". The game ready drivers literally weren't game ready.  And just in general stretches of weeks to months of bad drivers consecutively that led to people basically constantly having to check in on which specific driver versions were ""safe"" to update to and when to stay on version for long periods of time before updating. It was at least half of 2025 if not three quarters of it that Nvidia had questionable drivers. Meanwhile AMD's drivers were probably the most stable they'd been in a while for the bulk of 2025, including the launch day drivers for RDNA4 were weirdly just good. They did have the advantage of the delayed RDNA4 launch but day 1 9070 and 9070XT drivers seemed to just kinda work.",Negative
Intel,Had the same problem.   to fix the constant driver time-outs I had to disable the igpu.,Negative
Intel,They’re also all above 300 fps and he’s only playing 1080p. Will that much fps make any real difference considering the monitors at theat resolution? OP can save a good amount of money if they just get a cheaper card like the 7800 XT.,Neutral
Intel,"Screams ""i don't do my research"".",Negative
Intel,"If you don't mind tinkering with things, you can usually enable it even if not officially supported. I just started using optiscaler but I recently got a 9060xt. With a 9070 you're probably right that it's not really needed, especially where it's not already supported",Neutral
Intel,Odd take.,Neutral
Intel,"I mean, what does a 5070 have over a 9070 xt in CS2 then?",Neutral
Intel,"I mean, unless they’re planning on only playing CS2 on their PC and nothing else for the rest of their lives, the 9070xt would probably be a better option overall. For me, the better graphics on a lot of things and stronger performance are more important than an extra 36 fps on a card that already gets almost 400 fps.  Also, I saw that a driver update in July allowed the 9070 XT to beat the 5070 in 1440p, but I don’t know when these specific benchmarks were taken, since I’m seeing several different ones. Does anyone know where this benchmark chart is from?",Neutral
Intel,"Wtf is this question then? You can go with 300€ cards and get above 300fps at all times.  If you want to be free in the future, you're forced to go AMD anyway, since NV refuses to patch to Linux.",Negative
Intel,"Note how even the lowest card on that graph is higher fps than your monitor? Get the cheapest one that does your max refresh.    Of course that graph is also 1080p, so if youve got a different resolution you should use that as your basis. But most modern cards will crush CS2. Its not a very hardware intensive game.",Neutral
Intel,"Fair, but I'm not sure that a 9060XT wouldn't last for several years. Personally I'm hoping gpu prices come down a bit in the near future so I can grab a 9060XT myself. I'm also staying on AM4. In either case, GLHF!",Neutral
Intel,Ok cs2. Same shit. OP must have 500hz monitor.,Negative
Intel,"yeah my job/business is well, gaming PCs   though I'm liquidating all of the new in box stuff and quitting it all",Positive
Intel,"you are mostly right. any frame above your max refresh rate is a waste of electricity.   however, if you are getting 200 fps on a 100hz monitor, thats not exactly a waste. monitor displays the most recently produced frame at any given moment. that means the higher your fps, more responsive the game feels.   can most of the people can tell the difference? probably not. I cant tell myself. Still i lock my fps double the amount of refresh rate. fps dips during gaming. its nice to have some headroom even if you cant tell. at least for competetive fps games.",Neutral
Intel,"Cause back in the day when we played TFC/CS we barely made 30 fps    Even for today standards , a hair above your monitor refresh rate is enough    buying a 5070/9070 for 1080p cs is straight up retarded",Negative
Intel,"There is no reason to buy a 9070 over a 5070 given the minuscule performance difference but big software features quality difference, so it remains the same.  9070XT is a complete performance tier above. But also a whole price tier above.  It’s all about budget.  I personally think that unfortunately for AMD if loking for a 9070XT might as well get a 5070ti If looking for a 9070 better get a 5070",Neutral

If anything, AMD additional bloat software has caused me issues, but I uninstall it and use lossless scaling.

Intel,And give you 8gb ram plus upscaling to called it even,Neutral
Intel,"Frame gen is not that bad, I was against it previously but after trying it - I don't hate it and my use case is worst case scenario because I'm playing around 40-70 fps, lmfao",Negative
Intel,Yup. That's the only issue with AMD cards. You have to tinker with windows settings to turn off auto updates or else it fucks your drivers. That's more of a Windows issue than AMD.,Negative
Intel,"Screams ""I only listen to redditors"".  I swear you could inverse reddit advice for PC building and come out on top 99% of the time.",Neutral
Intel,"I agree, but sometimes you read reviews and see benchmarks of a GPU, think it will meet your usecase and then it doesn't. Then you got that annoying niggle in the back of your mind, that you messed up, and now are you going to live with it, or take a small hit and get what you actually should have.  To give one example, would be people claiming card can play 1440P/4K, when they can probably play those res at Mid setting to an acceptable FPS, or only on older games. And example would be all the people claiming a B580/9060XT 16GB does well at 1440P, when they honestly don't, unless you are playing some older games/less intensives games (Or want to play 1440p with a mix of low-high setting and get a barely stable 60 FPS on more intensives games with upscaler).  or the people who loved to claim a 4070TI was a 4K card. New builder may also get confused with benchmarkers using a 7800X3D/9800X3D to test a budget and mid tier card, not understanding the CPU is helping it's performance and a mid tier CPU will produce different results. Games also get patches which cause worse performance. You could end up watching an old benchmark, from maybe even 3-9 months ago, and get a false idea of what the GPU can do in the game you plan to mostly play. E.G: Tekken 8 released and the min GPU to play FSR 2 Ultra performance low/mid was a 1050TI, after a few patches (\~9 months) it was a 1660TI, nowadays 18+ months on, it can barely run on a 2060S at min setting. This was across the board, a 4070 was producing worse results at older settings and you had to crank down the res and/or setting. ETC ETC. There's a lot of reason why people end up slightly upgrading after they bought, even if they have done the research.  A lot of people on this sub, also don't help, people have mad copium and love to inflate the performance of their GPUs. It still isn't uncommong to hear, Oh yeah my 3600/3060 crushes \*insert new modern intensive game\* (e.g: MHW), when they really do not. Not a diss to those will older hardware, but stuff like that circulating only helps to confuse people.",Negative

Intel,"It seems like that’s the case.  “ I only play CS2.” doesn’t really leave much room for interpretation.  Like I would certainly get the 9070 XT over the 5070 in almost every situation but if this is the specific scenario, yeah, I would get the 5070.",Neutral

Intel,"Except for the obvious the price.  OP has stated that in his area the price of the 9070 XT is the same as the 5070, should be a no brainer.

Intel,5070 ti is like $300 more in my region compared to a 9070xt. It's a no brainer for me to go with the 9070xt in that sense.,Neutral

Intel,"The 9070 and 5070 are essentially the same in performance tho, and why I prefer the AMD card is not having to deal with the 12vHpwr and having 4 gb more vram, also mutch better Linux support.   It's a hard pick tbh, but I value this more than the Cuda cores, ai performance and other Nvidia things, of which I only can miss dlss, since having both main competitor's software available is a win, but I trade core stuff. It's a tough choice",Positive

Intel,"Just to add some balance: Had to toss my 5700xt last year because I constantly got critical display driver errors. All monitors shutting down and then the PC rebooted itself, for weeks, with X different drivers I tested. DDU, clean Windows install, tested the card in my server, tested another GPU in my main PC. Googled for hours, tried so much, then I took the L and went Team Green.

Plus, again it's a new account that only has a single comment.  1 is not even a driver timeout issue but the very same tazman137 from this thread making an anti-AMD comment again.  Coincidence?  I think not.  His post history is full of anti-AMD stuff (even their CPUs, which are widely regarded as the best).  This is just a reminder that search results are not equal to legimate claims.  You have to verify the voracity of the posts and their posters.  As always, consider the source.  With the above in mind, where exactly is this ""massive"" amount?  It seems to be that cursory investigation proves my point quite clearly.  Basically your comment boils down to you going to a different subreddit and getting different results from the one I searched.  You didn't once consider that ""hey he's not a liar, we just searched two different places"" and you didn't actually look into those individual reddit posts.  You say you don't have a dog in this game or don't want to call me a liar but then proceed to disprove yourself that very same sentence twice.

There’s white a few things.  No fanboyism here, just a ton of facts that you ignored",Positive
Intel,"Lol no, no it's not. The stability of the drivers + large advantage in ray tracing and AI capability + longterm support are all huge advantages for Nvidia currently.

Intel,"While I agree it’s a valid point in favor of the 9070, honestly at their performance tier, the number of games where, at the resolution this GPUs are aimed for wich is 1440P and if triple A, upscaled 1440P. 16 is an advantage over 12 in very very small amount of games.  And seeing the RAM situation I don’t expect vram demands to increase at a normal pace during some years, I’m expecting stagnantion since, even if AMD says so, I highly doubt they’ll be able to mantain prices.  Maybe for half a year but eventually they’ll have to buy more Vram and prices are through the roof. High vram GPUs will be very expensive for some years now.  Whether nvidia or AMD both will be very expensive. So I wouldn’t be surprised if both corporations focused on low VRAM GPUs.  Wich means stagnantion.  What do you think?",Neutral

Intel,All the ones that said wait for supers… but now they’ll be ultra overpriced thanks to ai.  Can’t make shit up,Negative
Intel,The difference isn't $700 though. I have a friend who constantly buys and sells shit on marketplace. You're assuming he bought them both new and threw the old in the trash.,Negative
Intel,"I'll be honest mate, I agree with you. I personally only think an upgrade is worth it when you get a 20%+ performance increase. Like I've myself have battled with getting a 7800X3D when they go on sale (best sale I saw was \~$250 about 6ish months ago, was so hard not to pull the trigger), since the performance uplift from a 7600X, in CPU intensive games I play (strat games) isn't enough. Sadly I have an asrock board, pre-9XXXX release, and yeah with their issues with a 9800X3D, it isn't an option for me...  But you can sell a brand new GPU, esp a 5070, for a minor lose (ESP right now). And get a 9070XT. It isn't dropping $700+. It's dropping the difference of what you got used for your old GPU and the price of the new one. That could be $0-100, to get the GPU you wish you had got from the start. Which isn't too bad to many. AMD card also sell for cheaper used, it isn't that hard to sell a used Nvidia card and get an AMD card from the same gen, used, for almost the same price. Not long ago, I sold a 4070TI and got a Used 7900XTX and had some money to spare/made a profit. I wanted to play 4K and the 4070TI wasn't cutting it. I also got an amazing deal on a 2 week old 7900XTX, seller wanted better RT performance for Cyberpunk, and got a 9070XT.",Neutral
Intel,"Sure and I totally agree but they seem quite clear about just playing this game and I think something to highlight would be that they can save a bit of money by getting the 5070. It’s also going to be viable for other games of course it will, more than that they seem to be playing at 1080p for this particular game so I would suspect that they probably have a 1080p monitor and at that resolution you really don’t need a 9070 XT. I don’t know if CS2 is going to get updated with this, but Nvidia is also doing their reflex 2 framewarp which no one seems to know when it’s coming out, but if you are a competitive gamer, it’s probably a big deal. Honestly, I’m fascinated by the whole argument because it seems ridiculous to me to buy any of these modern midrange cards in order to play one game, but if that’s what OP wants to do, I guess it is.   They seemingly don’t show any interest in other games if they did the 9070 XT is obvious the better choice but that’s still overkill for a 1080p monitor where I do think that a 5070 is more reasonably specced with 12 gigs of VRAM going very far at that resolution and the performance being respectable. You should likely be able to play everything at like ultra settings and have a good experience on a 1080p monitor.",Positive
Intel,"I don't disagree that Nvidia has better features, but we've reached a point where AMD is catching up, which over a year ago wasn't even close.  FSR 3 was below DLSS 2, while FSR4 is somewhere between DLSS 3 and 4.  You get AMD if in your region you want a midrange card that's the best bang for buck possible, if it's priced correctly.  I disagree with the 7900 XTX being obsolete, you bought it before FSR 4 was a thing, in my opinion it still performs exactly the same. Perhaps some expected it to get a better upscaler, but even this is speculation.  Both Nvidia and AMD have been known to release new features only for their new cards. However AMD open source more, if it wasn't for them we'd still be paying for modules in monitors for G-Sync.",Neutral
Intel,I had a bunch of issues driver wise and compatibility wise with my 3070ti but no issues with my 6800xt.   I actually prefer the software and puts out for modifying the settings for each game.   I also don’t like ray tracing or frame generation on either platform though. I’d rather have the 100+fps,Neutral
Intel,Nvidia has better features but a **9070 xt** at same price as 5070 is no brainer. Its legit a tier up.,Positive
Intel,"And yet AMD has better price to performance ratio in almost all games. While I agree nvidias AI features are better, the difference is not as big as it used to be. FSR4 is vastly superior to FSR3. Antilag (2) is also a very good option to Reflex, I've actually noticed a bigger difference than I did with reflex, but it does not work properly in every game, so some tradeoff there.   FSR does have less support in new/old games, but any major new release always has FSR in my experience.   Day one driver support being better on Nvidia isn't really relevant when they still have a lot of issues with games not fully utilizing the nvidia cards, and this has a big problem this last or two year for nvidia. You simply don't need day one driver support on AMD for most games. There's been numerous games where the 50XX series has had worse performance than the 40XX series in new games even with day 1 drivers.   So while I agree somewhat that Nvidia is higher quality in general, it's a lot more nuanced than you make it seem",Positive
Intel,"Few yeara Ago I brought my first nvidia gpu (3080) because of promises of great tech. Only nvidia tech I’ve used is nvnec, others are really gimmicks- frame gen increases input lag, DLSS I have never needed as I get decent fps without it, I tried it with space marine 2 but didn’t like the result. Second time I wanted to try dlss was with EFT but that game just has bad implementation of it. Also atleast on Linux amd drivers seems more stable, I’ve had issues after kernel update with nvidia.",Neutral
Intel,"He plays cs2 , only thing thats worth mentioning there is reflex , which is considered superior over antilag , but its not really a dealbreaker .  Op should focus on an X3D chip and a good monitor , + decent gpu , personaly i own a 9070xt and r5 7600 , and im happy with it , also CS2 only basicly , going with anything higher gpu wise is not worth it , cpu is what matters a lot in cs , expecialy X3D chips .",Positive
Intel,"It's literally pure fanboysim, 95% is DLSS/RT which either isn't used by the niche in case of DLSS or shouldn't be used at all (RT) due to complete FPS crippling",Negative

Intel,This is a good list. Thank you for making me feel better about my 5070.,Positive
Intel,"There's also driver support to think about. Nvidia supports their cards for WAY longer than AMD does. AMD sometimes seems to randomly remove driver updates for certain cards.  I know AMD has an appealing price point and feature set on paper, but in real world testing I'd say Nvidia is the winner. Even if it looks like you'll get a bit worse performance, the security of knowing your card will be supported for years and years is worth a lot to me.",Neutral
Intel,"your fanboysim goes great lenghts son, good job here a pat on the back by the company that couldn't give two shits about you",Positive
Intel,"Do you believe every single tech you see will be mainstream?  As a person with a masters on computer engineering, It will be incredibly hard for this to make it to mainstream.  And even if it does, they would become such a ridiculous monopoly they would give it to amd as well (which is something they already do)  At that point, because this tech exists, we will cram so much stuff into the games that the vram usage will go up again, I guarantee it.",Neutral
Intel,"Well just saying that there is a reason, not no reason at all like you said to choose 9070 over 5070.",Neutral
Intel,I m trying to explain to you that some of new games need more vram to run rt   8gb was here for scale mostly ok for 1080p  12gb is fine for 1440p but when you ad rt its needs a lot more i doubt new games will be using less and less vram  Also wdym by 9070xt is not enough for rt? Amd rt hardware got a lot better with 9000 series and 9070xt gets you more fps than 5070 12gb in rt just go and check youtube benchmarks,Neutral
Intel,"If the points I've made are wrong, then prove it with words.  Not logical fallacies and ad hominem distractions.",Negative
Intel,"A brand new 5070 goes for about $600, so I’m the best case you’ll get $500 on the used market if you get lucky with Facebook marketplace goblins. So, $200 and a piece of your sanity for marginal uplift is still kind of a shit deal even before you consider the value of your time.",Negative
Intel,"They said that the price is the same in the last sentence of the post, by the way. That’s why I’m arguing for the 9070 xt. Being overspecced isn’t a hindrance to gameplay, but being underspecced in the future will absolutely be.",Neutral
Intel,"Just in regards to fsr vs dlss, imo its less about the quality of the upscalers and more about adoption rate. The amount of games that natively support fsr vs dlss is like 10 to 1 in my experience. It does seem to be getting better, but my point is the fact of fsr becoming much better is moot when adoption rate is so low.",Neutral
Intel,"So the only game he plays is cs2? Is that really a thing? I get having a favorite game you sink most of your time into but yall are talking like he will never boot another title, period",Negative
Intel,Literally every game i have installed right now has RT and I notice a lot how much worse the visual fidelity is without it.  Don’t extend what you care about to wha others use/need,Negative

Intel,also no longer relevant,Neutral
Intel,"Lmao friend, I have an Arc B580, a 9070 xt, and a 5070 ti, and the next GPU I buy will be whatever Intel cooks up for Xe3. Your fanboy nonsense has no power here, I'm just a pc building enthusiast who doesn't care about your tribal GPU wars. Also, if you think AMD cares about you anymore than Nvidia does, you're a fool lol.",Neutral
Intel,"What do you mean “believe it will become mainstream”  Im not talking about some university study publishing their findings in some cool tech feature that could change stuff etc… and opening a fund raiser to start working on it.  I’m talking about Nvidia’s GeForce department publishing their demo of it in 2025 CES and announcing it as coming soon to RTX GPUs in fact it was supposed to be launched for the 5xxx series but seems it’s still not ready.  If anything they have more reason now than ever to invest on it, since with current ram prices, keeping high VRAM GPUs at prices that have any chance to sell in the consumer market seems impossible.  A feature that makes 8GB GPUs still feasible in 2027 is something they and every likely to focus on, since ram prices won’t go down any time soon",Neutral
Intel,Beverly a product for future promises. That’s a big no no,Neutral
Intel,"The difference in time was 3 minutes based on timestamps. Does it take more than 3 minutes to read that?  Alright. Again clearly you want to rep some agenda, I've clearly walked into it  my bad. Have fun.",Negative
Intel,Why are you assuming he can't buy a 9070xt used on marketplace?,Neutral
Intel,"From what I can tell most new games support it, but titles that have been released already often do not.  That said, I'm someone who uses upscaling when a game is too demanding. I fully believe Native is the way to go, but I do see the value for upscaling, especially when framerate goes below an acceptable rate.  What I mean is, I expect a 4080s/5070 ti/9070 XT to run most titles already out there at max settings without upscalers. 4k might have more outliers, and there is of course path tracing, but in general I don't think it's a big issue.",Neutral
Intel,Fucking finally lol,Positive

Intel,"quick look on ebay shows there's a fair amount, at least in the uk, but they're either used and super close to the price of a new one or never used and the same price as a new one. either way it's not worth it and better to just get a new one from a proper retailer so you'd get warranty",Negative
Intel,Personally I'd take the 1st one. Performance between the 8700f and 14400f is pretty much the same for games and I'd rather have a cut down 7700xt than a 5060 as it should pull comfortably ahead in most titles and the extra vram is cool. It's in a better position to upgrade once prices stop being fucky as well,Positive
Intel,the B580 oneo,Neutral

Intel,"I have the explanation.  You know how everyone was begging for a return of AA games, right? Everyone was fed up of only AAAs with inflated budgets and indies? People wanted mid-budget ""AA"" games more often?   That's where Unreal Engine 5 comes in. The Monkey's Paw curls a finger.   It allows teams to make games much more quickly, and gives lower budget games the opportunity to have a much greater scope both in terms of graphics and content (e.g. Clair Obscur Expedition 33). Also just because it's Lego doesn't mean it's not going to look gorgeous. If this has Lumen, this is going to look better than Arkham Knight in terms of lighting.   But UE5 is notoriously tougher to run. That's why they don't want to underbelly how intensive the game is. Odds are, it should run fine on a lower end card. But they don't want to be complained at if it doesn't.",Neutral

The recommended specs are slightly more generous than the last Lego Batman game: recommended was 4 to 5-year-old GPU's (GTX 480 and Radeon 5850), while the 3080 is nearly 6 years old.

Intel,"This a terrible comparison in so many ways. Much akin to people comparing gpu/cpu prices in the 00s to today.   Look, I don't expect the gtx 1080 to be running this game at ultra, but I kinda thought stuff like it would at least reach minimum requirements.    RTX 3080 recommended is crazy.

Intel,"> We truly need to call bad craftmanship out more.  People really want 'Indy' or 'AA' games while demanding a degree of technical excellence that even most AAA productions can't afford...  E33 made an excellent compromise to deliver on its aesthetic.  You can't do this on the same budget with a custom or older engine, or at the very least take a huge risk that it just won't work out.  It takes much bigger studios to maintainwell optimised engines with modern feature sets that are suitable for general game development, like id with its id tech engine or Ubisoft's Anvil engine.",Negative
Intel,"Comparing a 2015 game to a 2025 game is kind of weird man idk.     Clair obscure runs decently on modern hardware, I've seen people with budget rtx4050 laptops running it.",Negative

It features all the standard photorealistic graphics and characters you'd expect from a high-end 2025 release, with a large amount of natural environments. I would expect it to scale down as well as, say, MGS Delta.",Neutral
Intel,RT isn't required in 99.9%+ of available games. I'll survive without the remainder. Those devs are choosing to make their games exclusive to a small portion of the market.,Neutral

Intel,"My kid's 2070 is *outraged*, *outraged, I tell you* but the kid just drops to medium or uses DLSS and he's happy.  Probably throw a 9060XT at him later this year.",Negative
Intel,"I remember buying Command and Conquer Generals only to find that I couldn't run it on my still fairly new PC. It often only took around 2-3 years for hardware to start becoming seriously obsolete.  Generals released in 2003 and required a DirectX 8.1-capable GPU with at least 32 MB VRAM. This ment it needed an Radeon 8500 or GeForce 4 from late 2001/early 2002. Radeon 7000 and GeForce 3 GPUs from 2001 were already outdated.  Those GPUs released at $299 MSRP. Adjusted for inflation, that's almost $550 today. So depending on how you want to compare prices, that's roughly on par with requiring an RTX 4060 or RTX 4070 Super for a game released in 2025.  The fact that people now believe that games requiring 7 year old hardware is a sign of declining optimisation is kind of hilarious.",Neutral
Intel,"Oh heck, don't remind me about Evercrack. I was on Windows 2000 at the time with 512 MB, so didn't see that particular issue!",Negative
Intel,I've got the original big box PC version of Everquest pre expansion and the list of recommended GPUs on the back is absolutely wild. Shit you've never heard of. Diamonds and Orchids and Matroxx this that and whatever.,Negative
Intel,"dudes who be yappin about ""games aren't optimized anymore!"" don't know shit about ""unoptimized"" games. GPUs from 3+ years ago are still completely viable today but back then a GPU that's a year old would barely be able to play anything new",Negative
Intel,"I was running a Radeon 9700 when Oblivion dropped, bought it in late 2002. It was the king of the hill, I had it overclocked slightly over 9700 Pro spec.  Oblivion *killed it*. Even on ""Medium"". Even at 1024x768. FPS was below 20 at all times and dropped into single figures when refraction shaders were used.  That'd be like an AAA game today running badly on an RTX 4080 or 4090 from 2022.",Neutral
Intel,Gpu improvements have heavily stagnated. The 3080 is still stronger than the 5060ti 16gb and even trails the 4070 from last gen.,Neutral
Intel,you couldnt play games maxed out on $500 graphics cards even in 2005 without framerate dips.  as for now. a $500 5060ti 16gb running dlss 4.5 at balanced 1440p looks good and hits 60+fps.,Neutral
Intel,"It's a LEGO game now set in a larger open world and the visuals absolutely look more detailed than the last Star Wars LEGO game, which was set in smaller linear environments. Open world games just take more to render then closed environments do.   Like, I dunno what else to tell you. The 3080 is almost six years old. It's aging and it's perfectly natural that older GPUs move down into the ""recommended"" spectrum.",Positive

Intel,What would you say is closest to a 3080ti?,Neutral
Intel,The 4070 super is about the same,Neutral
Intel,"This isn't something subjective, it's verifiable. According to TPU, the 5060 Ti is only 11% slower while the 5070 is 15% faster.   The requirements talk about the 10gb variant so that's the one I'm considering.   Iceberg Tech also made a video comparing the 3080 12gb and the 5060 Ti and they seemed to be close, so the 10gb variant would be closer.   I'm sure there are more benchmarks you can lookup to verify the performance of the cards and reevaluate your understanding based on the results",Neutral
Intel,thought you were talkin about the Forza Horizon 4 expansion for a sec,Neutral
Intel,Playing Horizon with my son right now and it looks amazing.,Positive
Intel,"Me, personally, have a much better time with ue5 games than I did on the 4070.  Less stuttery",Positive
Intel,UE5 is bad on all cards,Negative
Intel,Arena Breakout Infinite is UE5. It runs in 3440x1440 at over 200fps on my 7900XTX. It's buttery smooth so to say.   UE5 runs fine on AMD cards.,Positive
Intel,"Seriously. When folks do these comparisons of older games vs. newer games, it's always games that at the time they released were technical achievements from some of the biggest studios pushing the boundaries of what was possible at the time.   That often had not only outsized budgets, but development timelines relative to what a smaller team can afford.  It's like uh, yeah, the game looks good because they put an immense amount of time and labor into bespoke assets and toolkits to achieve a specific aesthetic within the boundaries of that period's hardware. (and oftentimes not even within those boundaries, but pushing beyond them like Arkham Knight)",Neutral
Intel,Truth. I had no issues when I had a GTX 1080 last year.,Positive
Intel,The fact you can play the majority of modern games on 10 year old hardware seems to say the opposite of the point you're making.,Negative
Intel,Yeah but you need RTX and more CUDA cores to get all the best AI copilot features,Neutral
Intel,Big part of it as well. Everything is UE5 slop nowadays.,Negative

Intel,"RT capable cards have existed for eight years, if your PC rig doesn't have one it might be time for an upgrade ngl",Neutral
Intel,the 9060xt is pretty similar speed as it lacks dlss and fsr3 looks bad (unless the game supports fsr4). 9070 or 5070 are upgrades though,Negative
Intel,"And before Steam and indie games really took off we had a period of publishers dismissing all PC gamers as pirates. That era was full of just *atrocious* ports from consoles, if the publishers even bothered at all.    It was pretty much just Valve and Blizzard holding the PC flag for a while, and Bioware was at least good about adapting their UIs for PC (tactical mode in DAO, for example).",Negative
Intel,"I had ME at the time, and after adding ram to my system, I was soft locking about every 30-45 min.",Neutral
Intel,"Not to mention that a lot of the stutters of the Oblivion remaster are not because of UE5, but because the original Oblivion code still stutters on hardware from over 15 years later.  Asset streaming in open worlds is a hard problem. We live in a blessed time to treat the occasional shader compilation stutter in UE5 games a as a major issue.",Negative
Intel,I had a vanilla GeForce 6800 which I was able to unmask some extra pixel pipelines for extra performance. Not sure if I ever played Oblivion on that though because I played it a couple years after release. I might've played it with my next build with the GeForce 9800 gt.,Neutral
Intel,It doesn’t matter how old the 3080 is. It’s not a weak gpu by any means. It’s like 10% stronger than the 5060ti 16gb and only slightly trails the 4070 for comparison.,Neutral
Intel,Eh I blame developers just as much,Negative
Intel,"12gb 3080 and 3080ti are essentially the same performance, so the closest equivalent would be a base 4070 and 4070 super or 5070",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah there are a lot more advantages to the 3080(like its near 2x bus), and there are 2 variants of the 5060ti... don't know ""iceberg tech""... so wont speak to that.  When looking at either. We see that when in RT, the 3080 just smacks the crap out of the 5060ti 8Gb, and makes the 5060ti 16GB do a very good impression of the french. Only winning when it can leverage the 16GB Vram buffer, which is predominantly 4k, which is not a great res for that GPU anyway.",Neutral
Intel,"Tech power up isn’t accurate down to the perctanges like that, it’s more of a rough idea on where the perf of a card stacks up.   In real world benchmarks and game testing at 1440p/4K the 3080 is much closer to the 5070.   You even said that the 3080ti is closest to the 4070 super, which is correct. The 12gb 3080 is essentially the same thing as a 3080ti in perf, and a 4070 super is around 5070 perf too, so you basically agree with me already.",Neutral
Intel,haha. Lego Horizon Adventures to fully clarify!,Neutral
Intel,"Probably able to just brute force it a bit more, I found I had a better time when I went with the x3d chip from my 12th gen i5. The stutters hit less frequently recovered much faster than the gpu upgrade",Positive
Intel,bad developers are bad on all cards* ftfy,Negative
Intel,I mean 7900 XTX is still tied for like 8th best amongst non-commercial cards.  Its kind of a beast.,Positive
Intel,"There are definitely examples of ue5 that run fine on amd cards, but there are a lot that don’t.",Neutral
Intel,Worse than a game at max settings? Well yeah. A game from 2014 at lowest also looked worse than a maxed out 2004 game. Maxed out 1440p half life 2 vs lowest settings 720p shadow of Mordor (which was considered a good looking game on release…not so much later). Half life 2 clears.  It’s been like that for a very long time. Basically ever since graphics settings.,Negative
Intel,I think we're saying the same thing? Only a small number of recent games require RT.,Neutral
Intel,"And the physical hardware was so low quality.  GPU didn't even need a 12VHWPR connector to frequently fail within 2-3 years, because capacitors, coolers, PSUs, and the general build quality were so bad. [This thing was a $299 card in 2002](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce4-ti-4400.c180), and it's not like high-end cards were built much better. Even on a purely physical level, it's awesome how much better built a [modern equivalent like the 5060 is.](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-5060.c4219)  I lost 2 GPUs to those dreaded flickering polygons (afaik indicating that some memory cell or data channel had broken) just in the 3-4 or so years I was playing World of Warcraft.  Not to mention the buzzing audio because most cables and speakers broke easily. I had to weigh down the cable of my speakers to make up for a partial cable break constantly, and had buzzy sound every summer when temperatures went up.",Negative
Intel,Whoever said it's *weak*? It's now a mid-range GPU. It is *literally the recommended GPU* for this game.,Neutral
Intel,Thank you for the insight 🤝,Positive
Intel,Is HUB a big enough channel for ya? Their review puts the the 5060 Ti 11.5% behind the 3080 12gb at 1440p so within 10% of a 3080 10gb. I would not call that a smacking.   I'm not saying that the 5060 Ti is a good card or that the 3080 10gb is bad. All the comparisons I'm saying indicate that they're reasonably close to each other and that's about it,Neutral
Intel,"The post specifically mentions the 10gb variant of the 3080 though. HUB's 5060 Ti puts it 10% slower than a 4070/3080 12gb at 1440p as well, and the 10gb variant is a few percent slower.

Intel,"Oh yeh it usually runs bad, but this is Id's engine which runs amazing on amd cards generally. They did black magic to get it running smoothly. Obviously I couldn't use the path tracing mode but who cares.",Positive
Intel,"That's funny, because of course both Indiana Jones and Doom TDA at max settings run *much* better on your GPU than Control does. Because they have 'forced RT' so the games are actually built to *properly utilize* it, unlike Control which has the nice non-forced RT everyone loves - because it's bolted onto the existing engine and runs like crap. Just like *every* game that has RT bolted on runs like crap when it's enabled.",Positive
Intel,"I had one of the earlier fan cooled GPUs, and it had the bearing in the fan fail. It rattled for a bit, then the card died.   I remember all the issues with audio drivers, and it being generally recommended to have a separate sound card to get better stability for games",Negative
Intel,What I meant was the guy I was replying to says it’s perfectly natural for a 6 year old gpu to be seen in the recommended. Kinda insinuating that the 3080 is an older less powerful card that should be relegated to this status. Despite it being stronger than the less than a year old 5060ti,Neutral
Intel,"Again, what 5060ti...  You used a source. I used the exact same source. When you actually dive into the specific results, the ""12%"" average. Turns out its a lot more than 12% but occasionally the 3080 didn't run a vram parasite. You just have to open up the techpowerup results to see the details.",Neutral
Intel,Where my bro the 3070 ti? He falls right above the 7700 XT in 1080p.,Neutral
Intel,9800s only recently came out and honestly even the 5800x3d is still a premium chip. You wouldn’t be putting yourself in a bad position if you grabbed any x3d chip,Negative
Intel,"Sure, but also it *is* an older less powerful card. It's simply relegated from a flagship status to midrange - while 5060Ti although more recent was of course midrange to begin with.",Neutral
Intel,You can't just grab a CPU and call it a day. Moving from LGA 1700 to AM4 would be monumentally stupid. He can already upgrade to CPUs equal to the 5800X3D on the existing platform.,Negative

Intel,Feel like it's probably the best option at that price if you're scared of used GPUs at least (not that there much competition),Positive
Intel,The opposite of everything you just said is true. Drivers are stable now. It saturates 12 GB of VRAM if playing at higher resolutions. And it actually is not great for Linux if you intend to game.

Intel,"This guy is wrong. Intel has a substantial 10-20% performance hit on Linux. Not quite as horrible as Nvidia but nowhere near as good as AMD.   It is true Intel has open source drivers which is nice, but it’s still not a “good” choice for Linux gaming.   Intel does not invest into Linux gaming at all. They even said this blatantly in a recent interview with Digital Foundry.   If you genuinely care about having a good experience on Linux with no headaches, you need AMD sadly.",Negative
Intel,"On Linux it is mostly Nvidia who is troublesome when it comes to drivers. It is generally better now than before, but getting Nvidia drivers is still a pain in the ass if you want legacy drivers.   Arc and Radeon run great on Linux but game compatability is still not perfect. But that is not a driver issue but a game issue.   Most developers don't release Linux versions still so you need a specialised translation layer between Linux and the game.

If I have a game where more population of the city means more things to be loaded. It means that more population eats up more VRAM. I had a city with 60K pop, means it eats up 9.7gigs of VRAM when I am loading up that size city. If the city was let's say 100K, it's gonna be bigger which means more things to load which means more VRAM used which means potentially maxxing out the VRAM of my GPU.  Also if you didn't know this, maxxing out the VRAM of a GPU is not preferable as it brings stutters. That's why 8gigs of VRAM is not seen as enough these days. Because if I played my game on a 5050, it would start stuttering because I am maxxing the VRAM on that GPU.  Sigh",Negative

Intel,"The game uses 9.7 GB which is more than 8 GB, am I correct? How many graphics cards with 9.7 GB of VRAM do you know,? Asking that, because 9 GB in this case is too little and 10 GB would be underutilized according to your impeccable logic🤣",Neutral
Intel,"Dont overthink it, its just classic internet people confidently asserting stuff they have no understanding of",Negative
Intel,"Not necessarily. While it's not common, there are games and settings that will appreciate the additional 2 GB of VRAM the B580 offers, and the B580 will have enough power play at these settings at 60+ FPS.  TLOU2 at 1080p Very High is an example of this. It needs [at least 11 to run smoothly](https://youtu.be/1miEsftnFI4?t=447) (the 1080 Ti has stable but slow frametimes), and the B580 can get an [average of 80 FPS natively.](https://youtu.be/lLe5AP6igjw?t=611)",Positive
Intel,Out of all the comments you chose that one?? I understand that the GPU has to be strong because I can't be just using 12gb VRAM at 5fps. But guess what? I use 10gb VRAM at 30fps and I have some breathing room of 2gb because if you didn't know if you max out the VRAM in a GPU then your game starts stuttering. Like bro the b580 has a great amount of vram. The RTX 5060 is stronger but it would perform worse in my game since it only has 8 GB so idk what your end goal is here. To prove that the b580 only needs 8?,Negative
Intel,"Well, yes, but comparatively to other mobile parts like Z2 extreme chips they have performance issues on Linux.  That’s kind of unfortunate I think because Intel makes some really killer mobile chips that I would love to use but I don’t want to use Windows on these mobile devices preferably.",Negative
Intel,"Still who would buy them? I prefer the 9060xt for just a bit more to get something far better, I just don't see the appeal",Negative
Intel,"I'm not sure which one is the first one to come out with CUDA support, but the GTX580 was the first one people actually managed to run deep learning models on successfully  It's worth bearing in mind that pre 2012, the mathematics, datasets and architectures of neural networks hadn't really developed enough to take full advantage of GPUs  The software frameworks were also very limited back then. It's not just CUDA you need. It's a bunch of CUDA accelerated frameworks like CuBLAS, CuRand. CuDNN etc.  Nvidia has put a lot of work into developing all of those frameworks over the last decade and a half",Neutral
Intel,"I guess it even longer. It's actually ""XFX SPEEDSTER SWFT 210 AMD Radeon RX 7600 Core Edition"" Holy shit",Negative
Intel,"The point is that the actual speed of a B580 is more likely to be the bottleneck than its amount of VRAM.   Let say I have a big car. The car's trunk has room for 1000 bricks but the car's engine can only do 100 HP. The car can indeed carry 1000 bricks at once but it won't be able to drive very fast with 1000 bricks in the trunk. If you are very patient in trafic you could tolerate driving with all 1000 bricks at once, but most of us would rather carry fewer bricks and drive faster.  That it the same situation as with the B580 (but depends on the game). You could have a very large world with many building and people all loaded at once, but the GPU is not fast enough to also get you above 60 FPS.  If you can tolerate driving a big car very slowly, then good for you. Patience is a virtue after all.",Neutral
Intel,"The original comment says that the card has issues with utilizing the full 12 GB of VRAM, then this guy commented on it saying ""what do you mean it's not fast enough to use the 12 GB of VRAM?"" Then proceeded to provide an example if it only using 9.7 GB of VRAM... He could have easily provided an example of another game that uses the full 12 GB of VRAM.... Instead he provided an example of it using 9.7gb VRAM. Maybe I'm confused but it sounded like he was trying to provide an example to counter the original claim of it not using the full 12 GB of VRAM. Which he should have provided an example that used closer to the full 12 GB of VRAM, he could have used a different game that was more graphically intense to do so",Negative
Intel,"holy moly its like 9.7 is the theoretical limit the game can use. No, it will use more the more I play. Thats why having 12GB is great cause you have a bit of breathing rooom.",Positive
Intel,"One skill I'm really proud of in myself is my IRL ability to admit when I don't know something. Although I rarely actually say that on the Internet, because if I don't know something, I just don't leave a comment.",Negative
Intel,"My point is you made a dumb comment. I would say 10gb would probably be best to make it a bit cheaper, since 95% of people getting such a budget card are not running 4k games that will utilise 12gb. also  >Out of all the comments you chose that one??  yeah. I chose that one, because it was the first one you made in the chain, and the one I first specifically replied to. Am I supposed to dig up random ones instead?",Negative
Intel,"I wanted an A310 for an old PC that I have, way better than a Radeon RX 550. Sadly, that won't happen",Negative
Intel,"wowie this is the second car analogy. But actually damn your analogy is so much better than the last guy's. Yes this makes a lot of sense I understand!!! And yes I can tolerate driving a big car slowly, just like how I said, 20-60 FPS while using 9.7GB in 4K which is still impressive imo. But if it was a 5050 and I maxxed the VRAM, then my game would have bad 1% lows and start stuttering a lot, forcing me to turn down the graphics or resolution. So I think 12GB VRAM is perfect for the B580, 8GB is too little in my opinion. As well because I do use more than 8GB.",Positive
Intel,mmmm maybe the secret is using premium instead of regular maybe thatll make my VRAM go up! :D,Neutral
Intel,“Maybe I’m confused”  Yes.,Neutral
Intel,"I was just playing into their comment, obviously having a buffer is nice but even if 9.7gb was the maximum the game could use, there isn't a card that exists with that configuration it's either 8gb or 12gb",Neutral
Intel,"Ok and if I played my game for a bit longer than I would use even more than 9.7gb and my game will stutter if I had 10gb VRAM. But what's nice is the B580 has 12GB and I still have a decent amount of breathing headroom. Btw cities Skylines came out in 2015, what if I want to play an even more modern and unoptimized game? That 12gb VRAM is amazing for that situation. I really don't understand what you want, I personally bought mine for 300 euros and you can't get 12gb VRAM anywhere else for that price. Also outside of gaming, productivity work eats up a lot of VRAM and this makes the b580 a good option for people who build a pc for work.",Neutral

Intel,well yeah you can't compare them because strix halo is on a signficantly larger die wheras panther lake is more comparable to something like the hx370.   If amd is able to get strix halo at a competitive price then sure it will compete but the issue is that with such a large die I don't think it is possible for them to compete in price with panther lake,Neutral
Intel,I’ll never understand why AMD is not committing to design RDNA4 based APUs and at this point I just take RDNA 3.5 as a joke because they can’t even support FSR4 on it officially nor the RX 7000 cards.  It’s like they are losing on purpose,Negative
Intel,"AMD has this “it’s good enough for a while and we’ll release something great that people will forget this happened”  Vega lasted in mobile for nearly 5 years and got RDNA2 designs. Now, it’s RDNA3.5 being built for mobile platform and betting on that to be good enough until RDNA5/UDNA bridge die designs releases (unverified rumor)  AMD also has this weird obsession with competitor naming. Sure, it’s meant to confuse buyers but it’s hurting them than helping, maybe it does help in terms of inventory.  They’re not intel-like of stagnation. They’re competing but not for us in the consumer market and we’re just getting scraps until enterprise trend die down (currently AI trend/bubble).  Well, it’s understandable as Zen designs are really focused in Epyc and scale down to Ryzen SKUs.  And the 400 series is a bad refresh when Ryzen 6000 mobile is the definitive refresh they have done, Zen 3+ and move to RDNA2. AMD could’ve done similar commitment but it’s not currently.

Intel,"The GPU doesn't matter if you don't have proper drivers and they are so far behind still Intel.   Great progress, but the drivers are still going to be the thing that makes people say no.   If intel keeps on chugging away and they work with all the DirectX games backwards and going forward.   I'm talking past DirectX games, you can't just worry about the new games there's games that are older that don't run well.   It took AMD many many years to get decent drivers, Intel I don't know if they're just focusing on hardware and not the drivers, but that so far is what's been holding it back.   Hopefully they can release a true dedicated GPU back in rival something that's out there at a much better price that will bring at least some competition back until the AI scam is over.",Negative
Intel,Panther Lake is using a superior process technology. So they are right. But it doesn't matter as customer will choose what's better. But until AMD has something out that uses 2nm then yes they will be behind probably,Neutral

That's maybe 5% of the market and even then...most of them would get a dGPU anyways.  And apart from the GPU, what's special about the CPU? Combining (Lunar Lake) efficiency with (Arrow Lake) power? Sorry but my Ryzen AI 7 350 does that already. The top of the line x9 388h is about ~10% faster in single core aka the only thing that matters and will probably be in 2500€+ laptops whereas my 7 350 is in 500€ laptops.  I tried a 285h laptop besides the AI 7 350 and not only did it run hotter and less efficient, it also felt less snappier.    And the AI 7 350 was designed as a Lunar Lake competitor anyways so it was never worse in efficiency and ahead of Arrow Lakes like the 255h in that regard.  So I don't see why anything should really change...?",Negative

Intel,"And the price. I used to be an AMD fan, but as soon as competition with Intel was gone, AMD raised their prices and now act as if they believe they are a luxury brand. Hope Intel gets back into the game and if Intel can slash their prices it might end-up being the right choice.  At the same price, Intel is dead on arrival. At a serious discount they will take the place of AMD. No one is buying Strix Halo for handhelds, it is too expensive.",Neutral
Intel,"Both are right/wrong.  Intel made their comparisons to Strix point because they’re in the same power class. Panther lake is much faster than Strix Point at the same power level (according to Intel, AMD doesn’t deny that) at 45W.

They don't care about you, they care about making money and when they have a dominant position they will exploit it.  > At the same price, Intel is dead on arrival. At a serious discount they will take the place of AMD. No one is buying Strix Halo for handhelds, it is too expensive.  Outside of that one device (Ayaneo maybe?), you're right.  But now AMD is also releasing an 8-core version of Strix Halo with the full 40 GPU CUs, which should be cheaper.  I expect that we'll see that in more handhelds at the high end.

Intel,"It's not the 4050 at 60W. The laptop they compared only allows for 30W to the 4050. Nvidia's specs for the 4050 is 35W minimum, so I don't know how Dell even got to 30W. Below a certain wattage, gpu performance decreases exponentially because a minimum level of power is required to even have the gpu turned on.   Panther Lake is built on Intel 18A, which is supposed to be much better than the 'ancient' TSMC 5nm the 4050 is built on. The 4050's cpu is also Arrow Lake, which is less efficient than Lunar Lake. Again, that skews the agenda.   You can already game on thin and light devices with discrete graphics. Laptops like Asus's G14 is only 3.3lb, but sports a 4060 which is like twice as fast as intel's new igpu. The dgpu turns itself off when on battery, and the integrated graphics takes over. Anything more intensive should be used with a charger plugged in.   In short, paying for a big igpu doesn't make much sense for anyone interested in performance. And gaming handhelds? Does anyone really care about those useless bricks for investment into integrated graphics? It's not like the cost of Panther Lake is going to be cheap when its laptops start at $1300. With that kind of money, you can get 2025 Asus Zephyrus G14 with a 5060 and blow its shit out the water. Or for those on a budget, 5050 laptops have been seen for $600.   Integrated graphics have come so far, pairing Intel's newest 18A Panther Lake with an RTX 4050 could still make a lot of sense.",Negative
Intel,"Ehh not the mayority but *all* computers use iGPUs. The thing is, for the average Joe aka 95% of the market, there won't be a difference in the usage between an Intel Iris or RTX 5090 dGPU. And the efficiency would only come into place if they would game on battery (who does that anyways) or create/edit videos (again, virtually no one would do that without a dGPU). And even then, having your laptop drained in 2 hours 15 minutes instead of 2 hours is not ""gamechanging""   So it does not affect the efficiency at all during webbrowsing, watching videos, creating documents etc.  Thats also the reason why Intel has the non X 5,7,9 which will properly be by far the more demanded version as, again, the average Joe does not care the slightest about iGPU.  And apart from the iGPU, PTL is just a tiny step up from the Ultra 200 series...",Neutral

Intel,"How are you determining that AMD has a ""lead""?  In terms of Marketshare, Intel absolutely dominates x86, especially mobility (laptops), and if you walk into a Best Buy and ask 10 random customers ""Would you ever consider buying an AMD laptop?"", five of them would ask ""What's AMD?"", another three would say ""Isn't that a budget brand?"" (Their ""awareness"" of the zeitgeist of PC hardware is stuck in 2005), and maybe, and that's a big maybe, two out of ten would have a favorable opinion of AMD hardware so long as they've been paying attention for the last few years.  In terms of budget and expenditure, in 2025, Intel spent $17 billion in R&D versus AMD's $7.4 billion, outsizing it by a large amout. Total sales for 2025 are projected at approximately $53 billion for Intel and $33 billion for AMD.  I see this all the time and I've seen it for the past 8 years.... the only place that AMD has a ""lead"" is in the mind of PC hardware enthusiasts.... because it's not in the numbers as seen above (sales, expenditure, market share, etc), and it's not in the ""mindshare"" of your average consumer.  Hypothetically speaking, we could say that in a duopoly, as with Intel/AMD in x86, the BEST situation a consumer could hope for would be an even 50%/50% split in marketshare.... this would bring about the fiercest competition and would hopefully lower prices, increase innovation, etc. (and yet another reason why any fanboy who wants their favored company to dominate is LITERALLY cheering against their own interests as a consumer) Even with AMD's seriously impressive turnaround, their capture of marketshare, their ability to compete with two of the largest companies in the world while having considerably fewer resources, they still have a very, very, long way to go before approaching 50% of the x86 market across all segments.  In fact, to get any closer to that idealistic 50/50 split, AMD would have to continue winning and Intel losing for for many more years.  In other words, fears that AMD is ""becoming what Intel used to be"" and ""getting lazy"" are not an accurate reflection of the reality.",Neutral

So performance wise panther lake should be about on par with a full powered 3050Ti laptop.

Intel,Lunar lake came out after strix point. It was squarely a competitor to the 890m. Amd just officially released the cut down strix point as Z2E later.,Neutral
Intel,"No, not really. Making up a ""winner"" is stupid and nothing but fanboy behavior.  A faster dGPU is generally better because you’re generally not power limited on a desktop. It doesn’t really matter whether or not you have a 5060 or 5090 or whatever.  In mobile systems it’s a huge difference.  There are entirely different power classes that don’t compete with each other. A thin and light notebook with a 15W CPU cannot have a 100W CPU in it.  Panther lake aims towards unplugged performance which is the 45W power class and the same as Strix Point.  Strix Halo is a much higher power class that requires a laptop to be plugged in permanently for the full performance.  It’s for mobile desktops that are usually plugged in but can be mobile for some time with heavily degraded performance.  It’s an entirely different class of product and you won’t find (many) devices where Strix Halo and Strix Point/Panther Lake compete with each other.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, i am gonna contend that either that is wrong, and is the 4xe version, or that intel basically lied on their benchmarks.  If none of those two things are true, Intel's new graphics architecture will absolutely dominate in the next round of discrete graphics GPUs.  with B580 intel needed \~80% more silicon to match nvidia performance. Now they need \~10-20% less die area. meaning their performance per transistor basically doubled gen/gen. which is unheard of. Even maxwell (largest architectural uplift in the history of GPUs in the last 10 years) did not achieve anything close to that. And it was a massive overhaul with huge changes.

When you call it an ""octa-channel"" chip, what people read is that it has as much bandwidth as a Threadripper Pro, because that is how [AMD is marketing those chips themselves](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/workstations/ryzen-threadripper.html).",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, and AMD says Strix Halo has four channels in their customer facing spec as well, because they have 128b and 256b buses respectively. They use the 64b channel convention as it is a customer facing spec, that doesn't meant they actually have that many channels in hardware.   The Pantherlake datasheet isn't public yet, but you can see plainly in the [actual spec sheet](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/memory-controller-mc/) for Arrowlake H that it supports 8 channels of LPDDR5X (additional [spec](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/supported-memory-modules-and-devices/) for channel width).

You cannot gang these channels into a dual channel mode, that is not how modern memory works, and there is no allowance in the LPDDR5 spec for 64b channels. The 16b channels have separate command/address buses and burst for a sufficient length (32n) to fill a cache line with each access.  To be clear I think standardising on 64b ""channels"" for marketing specifications is a good thing, it allows quick mental calculation of memory bandwidth without having to get into the nitty gritty.

Panther Lake's cpu is built on the most advanced silicon process node 18A, designed to compete against TSMC's N2 (2nm) which is set to release in products in the second half of 2026. Panther Lake's gpu is built on TSMC N3E, a significantly more efficient N3. The 4050 is built on a custom 2020 TSMC 5nm variant, and Arrow Lake is built on TSMC N3+6nm. Arrow Lake is designed for specifically for high power use vs the low Lunar Lake and Panther Lake.   The future of integrated graphics is truly bright. I can see it being exactly where it is now.

I recently got a 9070xt and have been overall very impressed, but its achilles heel seems to be ray tracing. This isn't exactly surprising to me, as I researched my GPU options to death before buying one, and the general consensus is that Nvidia is stronger in the ray tracing department. But if I were to boot up, say, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, a game that supports ray tracing at 60 fps on the base Play Station 5, could I expect it to perform better than a similarly demanding game that wasn't particularly optimized for AMD hardware?  It's largely hypothetical question, as I already own the GPU, am satisfied with the GPU, and of course did my due diligence before buying the GPU so I would know exactly what to expect. But I just haven't really heard much discussion of what, if any, overlap we get optimization-wise for games that were optimized first and foremost for the AMD-based Play Station 5.",Neutral

Now my RX 9070 XT is not detected at all in BIOS or Windows Device Manager, and I only get display output from the motherboard.  WHAT HAPPENED To see the old SATA SSD in the boot menu I had to enable CSM in the BIOS. Booting into that drive resulted in a black screen.

Now I can boot into both OSs, but the GPU is completely invisible to the system.  CURRENT STATUS Windows Device Manager only shows the Integrated Graphics. When I try to install AMD drivers, the installer fails because it cannot detect the GPU.

So far, I’ve been dissuaded by the bigger warning on the AMD overclock section on the app, and I’m not sure how to do it or what to do. my temps are fine both CPUNGPU are around 50°C under load.

Intel,"Hi. HWiNFO is a very reliable monitoring tool, so unless there is a known open issue regarding sensors for your CPU SKU, I'd trust these temp readings.  I don't use a Ryzen 7 7800X3D, but the maximum operating temperature (Tjmax) for the 7800X3D is 89°C. If you're seeing temperatures over 100°C, that's likely a cooling problem that could damage your chip over time. I'd probably check my cooling system and setup if I were you. That said, another 7800X3D user might think differently, so maybe there is nothing to worry about.  Based on my experience, CPU temps over 100 °C usually indicate poor thermal management or inadequate cooling.",Neutral

Less than 15% in a standard AAA grade single player title if you play at 1440p. 0% if you play at 4k.   There's no single metric here as it really depends on a game. If you love 4X games like Stellaris I would upgrade. If you prefer Silent Hill or Alan Wake 2 I wouldn't.",Neutral
Intel,"It actually might make sense considering you are playing CPU heavy games at a relatively low res. I would also check if 5700X is available since it's pretty much the same thing as 5800X, except often a bit cheaper.   I see techspot actually tested BF6:  https://www.techspot.com/review/3043-battlefield-6-cpu-benchmark/#2025-10-15-image-png  3600 got 62 fps 1% lows and 86 averages whereas 5800X reached 80 fps 1% lows and 108 averages.

You can get the expo sticks, but the only thing that'd really change for you is the preprogrammed profile to allow you to get it with just a single setting.  The 7200 should run out of the box, but the CPU will switch into a different memory mode where it runs its memory controller at half clocks that lowers performance until about DDR5 8000, so that's why you'd go to the 6000 instead",Neutral

It could just be a few inaccurate readings.

Intel,"u/AMD_Vik Hey there! Just want to let you know that I've seen a lot of people have problems lately (including myself) with Direct-to-Display/Directmode implementations for DisplayPort/HDMI wired VR Headsets. DirectMode cannot enable reliably even on SteamVR native HMDs, and the only way to get them running right now is by installing a older driver version, enabling directmode there, and then updating to a newer version with the directmode already set -> so directmode itself still works fine, but there seem to be problems toggling into this. I also saw this happening with other VR compositors like PimaxPlay though radeon users are generally not as common there.  Happens with every driver released after and including 25.4.1 on my machine, and driver older than 25.3.1 can toggle into Directmode just fine. It is still broken as of 25.12.1 and 26.1.1  at first I thought this was a somewhat individual issue but as I've looked into it I saw more and more people have that problem with RDNA3 and RDNA4 GPUs across the board for basically any VR headset that uses Directmode.  I remember you mentioning on the AMD forums once that you want to be hit up about VR related issues - but really I didn't know how else I would reach out to you.",Negative

Intel,"Nope. Generally if the driver does not massively increases performance in some game, or you don't have any issues or the issue you have isn't fixed, then it's not worth updating, unless there is some new feature you want.    I reverted back to 25.9.1 (from the top of my head) because with any newer driver BF6 crashes randomly, and neither DICE nor AMD seem to give a damn about it.

RDNA 3: Partial Support via Develer’s VKD3D-Proton  - Develer’s VKD3D-Proton 3.0 includes support for FP8 (8-bit floating point), which is required for FSR 4. - This means RDNA 3 GPUs (like RX 7600, 7900 XT/XTX) can run FSR 4 in some games via Proton, even though AMD doesn’t officially enable it. - Global override toggles in AMD’s 25.9.1 driver can bypass the FSR 4 whitelist, allowing it to run in FSR 3.1-compatible games.

Here's the moment before it crashes to a black screen:  [afterburner screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/3YpJFtzM/Screenshot-2025-12-21-030537.png)  The dip in clocks is the moment it crashes. As you can see, it is running well above boost clocks. Hence, freezing in a few minutes, proceeded by a black screen, and a crash. The ups and downs are from me alt tabbing in the graphs, by  the way.   This is with core clock -200mhz applied in Afterburner and no crashes, boosts to just above declared boost clocks. Here the dips in up and down on power are probably me toying around how much exactly -mhz is needed.

As far as headsets are concerned, I know at least Valve's implementation seems to suffer from this (I know about cases involving the Valve Index, Bigscreen Beyond and Vive Pro 1, all using Valve's implementation), but somebody in the pimax subreddit community discord seemed to have the same problem, which he also was only able to fix by rolling back the drivers.

Intel,"Hi - I am having this problem. I wanted to try the special ROCM driver so dutifully did a clean install as suggested.  Tried to launch SteamVR and it errored. Realised headset had reverted to being a monitor, running at low resolution (less than recommended) Increased the resolution to recommended (combined resolution of the two panels), and SteamVR started detecting the headset - though promoted to enable direct mode. Pressing the button to enable it restarts SteamVR, but then prompts again, and HMD is still a monitor.   Interestingly reverting to the RDNA 4 release driver, it instantly worked - Direct Mode was enabled without me having to toggle.  So it is like SteamVR is successfully toggling something, but the newer AMD drivers ignore whatever it is doing/don't act on it. As soon as older driver is installed, it does act on it, and the HMD disappears from Display Settings/stops being treated as a monitor.  This wouldn't affect the majority of SteamVR users who are streaming to a Quest, and it wouldn't impact people who upgrade to a newer driver without a cleanup.

I'm asking because I've owned the game since day one but I haven't been able to play it cause my old 1060 6 GB was struggling hard with it, since then I've upgraded to a 7700 XT and for one reason or another I haven't gotten to play it yet but every time I update my driver and check the patch notes it's always a problem with it.

Intel,"Why is enhanced sync still broken? That was a feature I used to mitigate latency while capping frames to 120 and helped get rid of tearing. Now having it on causes major stuttering in a lot of games. I did come to find out that Vsync can be enabled globally and I'm not sure how long that's been a thing. Since being on the 5700 XT, 6900 XT, 7900 XT and now 9070 XT, I was never able to use it globally but it's been quite a few drivers since I've checked if it worked.

Intel,"I am an RX 6800 user, so on the RDNA branch of the driver,  25.11.1 introduced a severe performance regression on a DX9 game (Fallout New Vegas) , with framerate basically getting halved over what I had before  Downgrading to 25.10.2 fixed the issue , not sure if replicatable (I use 70+ mods) , and not sure if it affects any other DX9 games other than Fallout: New Vegas  (My cpu is an intel i5 10400F in case that matters, in New Vegas, on the 25.10.2 Driver, cpu utilization is almost always between 70-100% on the primary core that the game uses, while on the 25.11.1 driver , it was consistently at or below 50% , which leads me to suspect the new driver caused a regression in CPU utilization in DX9 and/or old single-threaded games, downgrading to 25.10.2 completely fixes the issue )",Negative

Intel,"There will already be branching inside the code of the driver. This has been the case already, to various degrees, for years. It's not new.  It's just whether AMD wants to formally spread those branches out on a file / compilation level and distribute different packages. And then publicly whether they commit to updating all branches of code or only some.  For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch. Of course, we have very little outside insight into the exact spread of these cases that AMD wants to pay their engineers to work on.",Neutral

I'd give this a quick read: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-update-and-see-what-graphics-driver-you-have-on-linux-and-steamos/  Pretty much the default is that you will be using the Mesa driver collection and they were last updated yesterday.  The fixes there do not correlate with the ones in this thread (I think).  As long as you are on a ""cutting edge"" type distro then you can expect that update in the next few days/weeks.  If you are on a ""stable"" distro that doesn't update often, you may be waiting a realllly long time.",Neutral
Intel,"Get what exactly? Features? Bug fixes? Optimizations?   Every 2 weeks there are new Mesa driver updates with bug fixes and performance optimizations. As for features, you have to wait a few months for versions with big numbers (25.2 is soon updating to 25.3, adding Anti-lag 2).   Depending on your distribution, you can get these updates faster or slower.",Neutral

Sometimes I can play for hours on end, other time game just crashes randomly after 10-15 minutes.  I am going to try to downgrade to 25.9.1 and see how it fares, since I remember that driver being really stable for me (6800XT).  Edit: been playing for 4 hours, no crash yet. Never had such a long session without the game crashing.  Will update in the next few days.  Edit 2: haven't crashed once, been playing at least 2 hours every evening.",Negative

Intel,"Weird. I was running 10.2 and things were running fine for the most part. I kept getting a pop-up on launch saying there was a known issue with that driver and Arc Raiders though, so I rolled it back to 9.2 and had more issues on that release than the one with the stated problems.  My fan control profile broke and stopped tracking gpu temp so last night I did a clean DDU install back to 10.2.

Intel,"What kind of FPS drops? I was having dog shit frame pacing, and hardcore drops to like sub 60 FPS at 1440p medium/high with a 6950XT. I went through every setting and found that anti-lag was the culprit. Once I turned that off it all went away. Then with future frame rendering it got even smoother.

It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.

Intel,"Damn, didn’t work for me last driver either. I can get FSR4 to work in other games just not BF6",Negative
Intel,Sorry for not replying in time with the pictures but I just saw that on Twitter that Beat Saber and AMD are now aware of the issue. The distorted flickering issue on the walls.  https://xcancel.com/BeatSaber/status/1993629046802882685  However there's another issue. I had not actually tried to use an Index at 90Hz until the other day. I discovered that the latency bug is back for 90Hz mode. As in I have to adjust the photon latency to ~5ms in the Steam debug commands to make it usable but not fixed. Just like in the the drivers before 24.12.1.   120Hz mode still works fine.,Neutral

Intel,Does fsr 4 work on 25.9.1? I thought the only driver that works without having to change any files and risk a ban online is 23. 9.1?,Neutral
Intel,"I had to rollback to driver 25.9.1, start up Star Citizen, switch the renderer to Vulkan, exit game, start SC again to verify it's working with Vulkan, then reinstall the latest driver again. Now it works, just don't switch it back to DirectX. No idea who dropped the ball on this one but Easy-Anticheat sure doesn't like the atidxx64.dll.",Neutral
Intel,I'm not sure. However when I install the driver it states that I cannot use adrenaline and gives me a link to the newest driver. Wondering if there is an earlier version of adrenaline I need to install.,Neutral

Intel,They do not.,Neutral
Intel,"Well, I used the system before the latest updates normally, for maybe half a year. Installed every update without DDU. I wanted to triple boot, formated the drive, left windows to install stock updates and drivers, went to install chipset and GPU driver and voila, every wakeup, just before I could type the pin, kernel panic and shutdown. DDU, just the driver, installed again, black screen. Went into DDU again, wanted to see if I missed anything and without reading, uninstalled everything AMD related, went into windows, installed chipset drivers from vendors site (ASUS) and then the latest GPU drivers, and havent had issues.

Intel,"Yes, I’m talking about 25.10.2 (posted the other day here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/s/nNunS1QlFX ). If you go to AMD download page and select “GPU” you get a file that has a different dimension from the one you download if you choose “CPU”. If you do the following steps 1) DDU (or AMD CleanUp Utility), 2) install CPU drivers => GPU not recognized or with a generic driver. If the you install the GPU driver you get the GPU correctly recognized and a yellow esclamation mark on the integrated. To have both VGAs working at the same time I have to download the AMD Auto Detect package (the file name ends with “minimal_install), but Adrenalin App does not open.",Neutral

Intel,"Appreciate you reaching out with this - that's an interesting data point to consider.  In this case, the quirky behaviour with HDMI 2.1 + FRL was attributed to a change made in the display stack, I don't think it explicitly involves display stream compression to repro, just high enough display bandwidth (though I could be mistaken)",Positive
Intel,"Interesting. I've been experiencing random BSODs on my PC too on a fresh Win11 install too, I was also suspecting it was something to do with auto HDR toggle but I didn't know for sure.  I'm running 180hz 1440 LG panel but I don't recall if it's using hdmi or DP. I've also never experienced BSODs until the last week or two, since i did a fresh install and I've had the same monitors/PCs for a long time.",Neutral

Intel,Thank you! Exciting keen to see what it’s like,Positive
Intel,"It has nothing to do with the lack of vulkan support, even when fsr4 comes to vulkan, the game still needs ray regeneration implementation from the devs, you cant use optiscaler through dlss inputs, like you probably will be able to in fx alan wake 2",Negative
Intel,I suppose is going to be fixed as soon as Amd Redstone go out. Basically is going to add every tecnology that Path tracing needs to work. Off course the devs would have to implement them in the game too,Neutral
Intel,"The issue is if you try to use path tracing. Which to be fair, you probably shouldn't unless the miracle of them getting Virtuous to implement Ray Regeneration in Cyberpunk happens.",Neutral
Intel,yes i tried it ... maybe it is because of the 7800X3D ... i really dont know... i will wait for the next patch ... should come tomorrow 18.11. ... but i have read so many threads and i am not the only one...,Neutral
Intel,Hmm fair. For me on 9070XT if I had raytracing enabled it would crash most regularly on loading back to the menu after extraction which was annoying but at least not game destroying lol. But yeah annoying enough that I turned RT off entirely.   I hope this means I can turn it back on because the game runs well enough for it.,Negative
Intel,"Yes. So far, so good. I'm not 100% sure what fixed it.      I uninstalled both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master standalone applications. Deleted the ""amdryzenmasterv"" keys. Rebooted.  Then I installed Adrenalin and used the Ryzen Master installer in Adrenalin (Performance > Metrics > Install Ryzen Master).  I think this problem might have something to do with a handshake breaking between Ryzen Master and Adrenalin, after upgrading just Adrenalin.   From now on, I'll probably do clean installs, removing and reinstalling both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master, through Adrenalin Performance tab.",Neutral
Intel,"My last two processors are ryzen amd, my last three video cards are amd radeon and next one will be amd also, nvidia has driver issues as well, to be honest.  But yes, some issues are too annoying and updating drivers is lottery at this point. I would advice against updating drivers unless you need it for specific new game or have the latest video cards - rx 9070 \[xt\]  or 9060 xt .  I should have sold the 7700 xt and bought 9060 xt 16gb instead but too late for that now and it has problems as well, so lottery as i said, its a risk.",Negative

Intel,Which driver version and does it still crashing?,Neutral
Intel,OK I will install it now and test it and get back to you. Give me 10 mins.,Neutral
Intel,Yuppp. It does not work on bf6 but it works on ark survival ascended for me. Seems it might be a bf issue. I saw ppl saying they were getting more fps with this driver in BF6 but I think they didn't realize it's using FSR 3.1 and not 4.,Negative
Intel,I'll work with the engineer from that ticket check if that issue has somehow regressed.,Neutral
Intel,We've not been able to reproduce this internally so far. Can you remind me which GPU (was this a 7900XTX?) + connectivity method you're using?,Neutral
Intel,Try using DDU to uninstall your current drivers and do a clean install of the 25.10.2 combined drivers if you havent already (you can find it here):  https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-25-10-2.html,Neutral

Intel,I don't see how it would work on 23.9.1 lol,Neutral
Intel,"Did you use DDU to uninstall the drivers and then reinstall using a driver installer from the AMD website? I found this guide yesterday and it was extremely helpful, specifically step 8:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1lnxb8o/ultimate_amd_performance_fix_guide_stop_lag_fps/",Neutral
Intel,I did it this morning before the new driver and confirm chipset drivers were untouched,Neutral
Intel,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.  More people use HDMI than what people think and those TVs don’t always have a DP connector at all.,Negative
Intel,"ah, that explains it. Thanks. :)",Positive
Intel,"What if one does not check release notes? V25.10.2 point to different packages, for installing both CPU and GPU you had to download the AutoDetect package (named “minimal install”). Obviously I’m referring to AMD driver download page.",Neutral
Intel,"Okay, as long as they have a workaround for that... I was planning to get a 9060XT, but also keep my 6700XT for lossless scaling frame gen, was worried the branching would affect that..",Neutral
Intel,"What a mess. I have rdna2 and 3 on the same PC, so combined driver is the solution for this? Or auto detect is the only way?",Neutral
Intel,"Damn, that's a huge relief to hear. Most of the frustration came from not knowing whether the issue was even acknowledged.   Thanks a lot for the update.",Positive
Intel,What about Noise Suppression not working since 25.9.2?,Negative
Intel,Finally. The last driver without pink artifacting was 25.4.1  It has been 7 months. AMD Matt acknowledged the bug on [the amd forums](https://pcforum.amd.com/s/question/0D5KZ000011WpJJ0A0/pink-square-artifacting-chrome-discord-and-steam) 5 months ago.

Intel,"what about whatever changed post 25.3.1 for multi monitors? Any driver 25.3.1 and older i can run my main at 200hz, my side at 165, and my third at 60 without issue. Any driver newer than 25.3.1 and running my main at 200hz then playing a game will cause the second monitor (165hz) to flicker, glitch, and freak out the entire time, until the game on the main monitor is closed. Dropping to 165 on the main monitor down from 200hz \*fixes\* the issue but, i paid for 200hz and would like to be able to actually use it again.  (7700xt system)",Neutral

Intel,"Hi. Sorry, I thought this was pretty common as I've had this issue with two different systems and 3 AMD GPUs across 2 generations. [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1jayump/chrome_full_screen_freezes_after_switching_to_amd/) [Or here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/3890720/parts-of-screen-freezes-when-using-chrome) Chrome (or other Chromium browsers, I've had this happen with Edge too) in fullscreen, with graphics acceleration enabled.   Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind this only actually matters if one protocol or the other is **actually** limiting bandwidth for the [resolution * FPS] you want to display on your monitor  For instance, DP 1.4 can do ~25Gbits/s, which translates to roughly 1440p @ 240fps, or 4k @ 120fps  If you have proper cable into HDMI 2.1, it should be able to do ~42Gbits/s, which would instead be 4k @ 190fps  Read up the wikipedia tables for bandwidth specs and resolution / fps / bit depth rates for more",Neutral

Intel,Cool. Thank you,Positive
Intel,I might turn on ray tracing in like a medium or low setting just for shits and giggles or screenshots but I don't plan on playing with it on all the time since I'll also play at 1440p so I don't wanna have a really bad experience 😖,Negative
Intel,Exactly! It's insane. I can't believe running through a translation layer is more stable than running native,Positive
Intel,"but i dont know something is also wrong with 25.11.1 ...

Intel,"Could be it, nothing hardware wise at all and just software too.     Yeah, you're not the 1st I've read that says they have issues on the game.     If you're crashing and the system reboots it does make me think of some stability issues and not really just GPU, but I'm guessing you've already tried stability tests and using the system without OC+A-XMP/EXPO disabled.     Once upon a time I remember reading some people, on other instances and other games, having crashes like that (complete reboot) due to PSU instability as well.     Good luck!",Neutral
Intel,That's strange. My game defaulted to everything maxed out including running ray tracing and I haven't noticed any issues. The game runs incredibly well.  I've got a 5800X3D & 9070XT as well.,Positive
Intel,"Fair enough, and yeah sooner the better for all of us",Positive
Intel,It absolutely could be.  Europe has some pretty good consumer law and promising features that could impact your purchase decision are part of this law.  It can fall under misleading advertisement,Neutral
Intel,"It's not freezing, it's just that the GPU usage is practically at 100% all the time, even with V-Sync enabled. With the 25.9 drivers, this doesn't happen, and the clock speed varies normally, increasing and decreasing as needed when V-Sync is enabled. These 25.10 drivers are causing the GPU to consume more energy unnecessarily.",Neutral
Intel,Fingers crossed,Neutral
Intel,"Thanks for attempting to retest.  It's a 7900XTX with an Index connected via DisplayPort. I am on the latest 25.11.1 driver.  I run a monitor at 4k 120Hz 10bpc with HDR Off, which uses DSC, as my main and only display. I tried disabling DSC in the monitor settings which runs at 4k 120Hz 8bpc with HDR Off but I don't think I noticed a change in latency. I thought that DSC on and off on two different devices might contribute to the problem but I'm not sure.   I have also tried running the Index under a RX480 on another PC and I fairly certain the latency looks different under 90Hz and looks similar under 120Hz. Can't play much to test though as an RX480 runs the Index at a very blurry setting. Getting around to doing this test is what took me so long to reply.",Neutral
Intel,Were you able to find the issue?,Neutral

Intel,"sli/crossfire were killed for good reason, its just a bad time all around if half of your gpu's core/cache is located a foot away from the other half, unless your baseline performance is so damn low that the microstutters just get lost in the noise.  ultimately chiplet cpu/gpu designs are basically just an evolved form of sli/crossfire, and we're happily starting to get quite good at those.

Intel,"indeed it did, if only game devs adopted this more. Then again, the idea of two high end GPUs like we have today in a single PC is kinda horrifying.",Negative

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative
Intel,One thing I appreciate about AMD is having the lowest CPU overhead for their graphics drivers. Makes a difference if you're CPU limited in a game.,Positive

Intel,So the money you save on a GPU you will need to spend on a better CPU??  Might as well get a faster GPU.,Neutral
Intel,Interesting that B580 doesn't look bad at all with a 13600k. I wonder what it's like with a 13400 or 12600k. It seems like just having those extra threads provided by the e-cores takes care of the overhead it needs.,Positive

Intel,"According to the graphs, AMD has slightly less overhead than NVIDIA.",Neutral
Intel,"No, they do not.  The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software.  They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  The main example that seems to suggest otherwise is actually a demonstration of nVidia's forced threading of DX11 games, which can increase performance despite the increased overhead it entails, when the CPU has enough headroom overall (i.e. it doesn't eat into the single-thread performance).",Negative
Intel,"Lowest with DX11 and older, but not with the newer APIs",Neutral
Intel,And when is the last time HUB did a dedicated video showing the improvement in overhead?,Neutral
Intel,or it's just a cache/memory access issue,Neutral

I think this will be great for non-gaming purposes, like Adobe, Autodesk and so on. 890M should be a photo editing powerhouse.",Positive
Intel,"I mean current consoles are already APU power houses, they can give you 120fps depending on the game, and 30-60fps depending on what mode you select.

Intel,"Radeon iGPUs are mostly limited by the shared RAM bandwidth. I was thinking of getting an 8700G a little while ago, and the benchmarks varied wildly depending on RAM frequency and overclocks.  Maybe they'll improve it by hooking it up to a wider GDDR bus in laptops, similar to how the current PS5 and Xboxes work (IIRC?)",Neutral
Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks. Intel is already moving on it and I think the main thing holding AMD back is that they rely on 3rd parties for memory packaging so the capacity goes to the more lucrative enterprise chips first.",Neutral
Intel,"The iGPU uplift is extremely underwhelming, I guess this is why Asus did the ROG Ally X model instead of waiting for these chips. I wouldnt be surprised if Lunar Lake with Xe2 passes Zen 5's iGPU at lower power levels, at higher ones im sure RNDA 3.5 will be ahead.",Negative

Nearly all of the configs that release of 16cu Point APU or 40cu Halo will be an APU slapped in a chassis without an adequate power or memory bandwidth setup for the igpu.     What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra. Its desktop tower chip is behind the entry level mobile OS chip from its competitor. It is a decade behind the desktop chips of its competitor, itis hardly Monster class.",Neutral

Intel,">AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs  AMD doesn't need to make ""Monster"" class APUs as they cater to the x86 desktop market where they make ""Monster"" dGPUs which can be upgraded independently.   And AMD ""can make"" such APUs -> PS5 Pro (as a more cost effective solution). AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative
Intel,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem.

If Intel can be competitive in the budget market it will at least put a fire under amd to lower their prices/make a better valued product.",Negative
Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't.

Intel,Doesn't make it less of a fact that users are experiencing issues and they still paid hard cash for those GPUs.,Negative
Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral
Intel,"This was a graphics card, not a ‘GPU’ in terms that we understand them now, just to bolster the point about how much of a disparity this comparison reveals.",Neutral
Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so?

It makes me wonder if they have used older drivers, since they don;t even get 60fps rasterized at 1080p in some games.  edit: And I paid much less than the minimum price they are listing, I'd need to check if prices went up - even though computer base suggest that isn't the case.

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Intel,"And I'm over here struggling to keep an Nvidia T4 passthrough to work reliably on Hyper-V to Ubuntu 22.04. :(  Is there a specific software combination that works more reliably than others?   Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.  They working with some kind of magic radiation over there?",Negative
Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.  You're free to guess what vendor om looking at to replace my CPU with. Damn shame really.",Negative
Intel,"Fact: AMD does not give a shit about any of this.   We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line. If all CDNA customers switch to NVIDIA and those PO's dropped in volume, it might make them care a little bit.",Negative

Intel,"I’ve been buying ATI / AMD since the ATI Rage 128, and I think my next GPU will be Nvidia. I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

Intel,"[Wish i could play Hell Divers 2 but when i bought it took 30 seconds to get a driver timeout,](https://i.imgur.com/FqM9MRx.mp4) anyway i decided to not switch NVIDIA cos i also well usually play a lot of World of Warcraft but that game has problems for both AMD in form of freezes and driver timeouts gradually getting worse until you update drivers again, cos shader cache gets reset it stops crashing again for couple of days, then starts crashing more frequently and the frequency varies per user and what they doing as well as if their some sort of memory leak.  Also some other games having driver timeouts to, but i have games that also never timeout.  Speaking of which users started reporting flickering issues in browsers such as chrome, or any chrome based browsers, and their 2 reports of it being fixed after MPO is disabled so i guess MPO issues are back on the menu.

I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.  Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical. I guess that's why nobody is already doing it.",Neutral

I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?

Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

Intel,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there.

So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

Intel,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place. And if this is a feature that they do not want to support, having the documentation needed to self-support the feature.",Negative

As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point.

While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it.

Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

These issues here have been reported on for over 5 years now, and what has AMD done for these clients?  Until I made my prior posts here on r/AMD, AMD were not interested or even awake when it came to these issues. I have had direct correspondence with John Bridgman where he confirmed that GPU reset was not even considered in prior generations.  Of what use are these support contracts and the high cost of buying these cards if AMD wont provide the resources to make them function in a reliable manner.

I've had exactly one driver-based AMD issue - when I first got my 5700XT on release, there was a weird driver bug that caused the occasional BSOD when viewing video in a browser - this was fixed quickly.  My gaming stability issues were always caused by unstable RAM timings and CPU OC settings - since I upgraded to an AM5 platform with everything stock, I'm solid as a rock. My 7900XTX has been absolutely perfect.  There is an unfair perception in gaming with AMD's drivers where people think they are far worse than they really are - it's a circlejerk at this point.  Your issue is different (and valid), you don't need to conflate the known issues in professional use cases with gaming - it'll just get you pushback because people who use AMD cards for gaming (like me) know the drivers are fine for gaming, which makes you come across as being hyperbolic - and if you're being hyperbolic about the gaming stuff, what else are you being hyperbolic about?

From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.  Does AMD need to improve things?  Of course.

For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.

Intel,"Use Radeon Image Sharpening at 50% in the game's Radeon Settings profile when running native. FSR2 has its own sharpening pass. Many TAA implementations are blurry as fuck, which gives the illusion of better image quality when upscaling.",Negative
Intel,Okay fair enough! To me any upscaling has always looked worse than native in the games I've played and I've left it off.  Though it has undoubtedly gotten better recently - to my eyes it's never looked **better** than native resolution.,Negative
Intel,"I've used both FSR (2160p desktop) and DLSS (1080p laptop) and the loss in quality is noticeable to me. Always a softer image with less detail - yes, even DLSS. Performance always has a cost. Temporal upscaling is no different. DLAA and FSRAA actually are better than native, since they replace terrible TAA implementations and render at native.  However, this better than native upscaling narrative seems more like a belief (or a marketing push/tactic) than reality.   - If action is high enough, it probably won't matter much, but in single-player games where I like to look around, I just can't deal with the resolution loss. I'd rather turn RT off, as I did in Control (for AMD and Nvidia HW), which actually has decent RT effects.",Negative

Intel,"lol. Six months late and $300 (60%) over the announced price.  If the dual GPU version was really available for $999 right now (as announced), then Intel would make significant inroads into the local AI market.  As it is, buying this for $800 over a used 3090 is a really hard sell. Compared to a B60, the 3090 is readily available for $1100, and provides the same VRAM, double the compute and memory bandwidth, better perf/watt, and CUDA support.  With the dual GPU cards even at $2k each this does have one single niche - being able to get 144 GB of VRAM in a server at under 1500W for under $10k -  which is legitimately useful for LLM inference.  It's really sad that Intel didn't put in the investment a year ago to have a lot of capacity to produce these now.

Intel,"i'm no expert but i dove in to Wiki      it was a [1GB/s to 3.25GB/s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Link_Interface) interface. For refference PCI-E 2.0 was 1GB/s and 3.0 was 2GB/s BUT per lane so 16 and 32GB/s.  For refference HDMI 1.4 has 10.2Gbit/s  So as i understood it most of the data bandwidth were used for tossing the image output back and forth as only a single card were the one outputting the image (assuming you weren't running tripple monitor widescreen setup on SLI GPU's....) and our image data could more or less saturate the link  someone correct my math if i'm totally bonkers, but 2560x1440p = 3.686 million pixels. each using 24 bit (8-bit color on 3 chanels) which is 88Mbit/s. if you output 60 of those that is 5.3Gbit/s. 1GB/s = 8Gbit/s. Okay okay you wouldn't always throw a full image so lets call it 2.5Gbit. You were still using quite a lot of the bandwidth on the image alone, so from my understanding most of the interface communication was more related to ""who did what"".  and in AFR you would be handing over a full frame.",Neutral

I really, really wanted a Strix Halo laptop, but the lack of SKUs, price and the inflexibility with RAM kind of make it unappealing to say the least, not to mention the power draw compared to Panther Lake is unwelcome. These laptops are gonna be probably the best x86 in mobile has eaten in a very long time.  On top of that, it's almost making the 5050 look like a stupid part in a laptop.

Intel,"Bingo  Strix is also limited by being RDNA 3.5 and no FSR4, so it's rather dependent on raw throughput, and it can't possibly fit in a comfortable handheld that would last for more than an hour and a half under load.  I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage. I hope they keep it up, it would really be cool to see an AMD vs Intel APU console war generation.",Neutral

And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.  Besides, Intel already has Nova Lake AX in the backlog, or whatever it's going to be called. Practically intel's strix halo.

But all I need to know is it's faaar bigger.  >panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus  That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.",Neutral
Intel,"Well Panther uses mixed processes, and hybrid tiles are bound to be a bit less space efficient than putting everything on a single die.

Case and point, AMD's R9 Fury X. Released with 4096bit bus HBM. Had a total memory bandwidth of 512GB/s. Yet the GTX 980 Ti released with a 384bit bus and 336GB/s memory bandwidth and it out performed the Fury X in pretty much everything.

Valve definitely wants a wider adoption rate of SteamOS and ditching x86 is not going to help that. They are **not** Nintendo that can ask devs to target their architecture. It's going well so far because for most games you can just make a standard Windows version, slap Proton and it works within 10% of native performance under optimal circumstances.

Intel,It is going to be in the Asus Tuff A14 this year.,Neutral
Intel,Yeah but completely different standard.,Negative
Intel,"That's a bit of a different case, because they are designing a new product either way they might as well look into supporting something like LPCAMM2. They already have a mainboard for the FW13 that can support these newer CPUs, so there has to be a very compelling reason to spend money to redesign that, which I think a single Intel SKU is not unfortunately.",Neutral
Intel,Do we know if we are getting real Nova Lake mobile chips or just a BGA version of desktop parts with a panther lake refresh?,Neutral
Intel,"The DRAM standard between LPCAMM2 and LP-DDR5x is the same - that's the point. LPCAMM2 is a replaceable implementation of LP-DDR5x memory.  But LPCAMM2 is completely different from SO-DIMM. SO-DIMM is DDR5. LPCAMM2 is LP-DDR5x.  You will see Arc B390 designs with LP-DDR5x memory down on the mainboard, and you'll see (some) LPCAMM2 designs, but they'll be far less common.  But you won't see DDR5 SO-DIMM designs - if they claim to be DDR5 SO-DIMM and Arc B390 then its wrong.",Neutral
Intel,"It certainly sounds like we will get dedicated NVL-H, and that's what the rumors claim as well. Here's an excerpt from an Intel executive at an Intel BoA conference:   >Yeah, so maybe just baseline everybody on Panther Lake, so Panther Lake is a product that’s going to launch in the second half of this year, and it is all built on Intel 18A. Really, Panther Lake is an all mobile stack. When you get to the next generation Nova Lake it is both a mobile stack and a desktop stack",Neutral

Intel,"It's not exactly weird. They went PPC before Intel because powerpc was more effective for workloads most people used macs for. The switch to Intel was just because Intel had node leadership and performance leadership. Instead stick to A-chips for low power mobile where intel gave up on servicing. Intel loses node leadership to TSMC for a long time, Apple moves on to everything in-house is a pretty logical progression.  Apple having bespoke solutions isn't new either. they've been doing it since their G workstation days. Their current situation is pretty much on brand for apple, but the difference is the huge mistakes intel made (particularly firing so many top engineers) that led to staff fleeing to other companies, including leadership at Apple processor design.  basically apple did their own thing as usual and did a great job don't get me wrong, not taking anything away from apple. the biggest difference however was intel's CEO and board destroying the company.",Neutral

Intel,"If Intel is really about to release a B770, honestly the **only thing that could make it competitive is the price**. (FOR ME, competitive in 2026 means <400€) From a performance standpoint, it would need to undercut existing GPUs quite aggressively to make sense, especially given how crowded the mid-range already is.  That said, I’m pretty skeptical about how realistic that is. **With the recent RAM shortages and rising memory costs**, pricing a new card competitively while still keeping margins doesn’t sound easy at all. Memory is a huge part of the BOM, and we’ve already seen how shortages can push prices up across the board.  So unless Intel is willing to take a serious hit on margins (which seems unlikely), I’m not convinced the B770 will land at a price point that truly shakes up the market. Happy to be proven wrong, but for now the pricing question is the big unknown for me.",Neutral

Intel,"are people high or something? intel was losing money on optane and their SSD business became irrelevant the minute regular memory manufacturers slammed the market. don't get me wrong, they were some of the most durable on the market, but they were no where near printing money on the memory business.  optane may have survived if their nodes were on schedule, keeping CXL support on schedule, but not because it was profitable.",Negative
Intel,CXL killed octane it’s that simple. No one wanted to be locked to just Intel. CXL was and is just better,Positive
Intel,"I feel like the price has to be more than competitive. If they can undercut competition cards of the same performance by 100 or so (or maybe offer rebates or freebies) they could potentially steal the market in that category. With Nvidia and amd cards being tried and true for many many years, I feel like their marketing needs to grab the attention of consumers in a somewhat drastic way.",Neutral

Intel,"u/Chelostyles Thank you for your inquiry regarding the CPU and RAM upgrade for your Dell Vostro 3670. As much as I'd like to provide my technical insights on this upgrade path, I'm not in a position to provide specific suggestions since this involves hardware modifications to an OEM system.  For the best compatibility outcome and to ensure optimal system performance, I strongly recommend reaching out to your system manufacturer directly. They can provide definitive guidance on supported CPU upgrades (i5-8400 to i7-9700) and maximum RAM configurations for your specific model. We don't want to inadvertently bypass any warranty terms and conditions on your system by providing modification recommendations that might affect your coverage.  Your system manufacturer's technical support team will have access to the exact specifications, BIOS compatibility matrices, and supported hardware configurations for your Vostro 3670 model. They can confirm whether the motherboard supports the i7-9700, the maximum RAM capacity (64GB vs 128GB), and any potential limitations or requirements for these upgrades.  This approach ensures you get accurate, manufacturer-validated information while maintaining your system's warranty protection.",Neutral
Intel,"u/I_like_carsyay  XPS 15 9530 hardware does support Resizable BAR, which is why Intel's system detection shows it as available for both your Arc A370M and Iris Xe graphics. However, the system manufacturer has designed their BIOS interface to prioritize stability and user-friendliness, often managing advanced PCIe features like ReBAR automatically in the background rather than exposing manual configuration options. This approach ensures optimal system performance while reducing complexity for users. I recommend checking for the latest BIOS updates from your OEM's support site and contacting their technical support team, as they would have the most current information about how ReBAR is implemented on your specific model and whether any additional configuration steps are needed to fully utilize this feature.     I've posted an article below in case you haven't yet come across it:  **Helpful Resources:**  *  [What Is Resizable BAR and How Do I Enable It?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090831/graphics.html)",Neutral

Intel,"Late to this, but I'm a 13900K owner. I have not had any issues with stability since applying the BIOS update and haven't noticed any performance loss, so I think this is fine. I did not thoroughly benchmark before and after though, partially because of how high peak temperatures were before the update. I am using a Noctua NH-D15 and a contact frame to reduce CPU temperatures.  Up until a few days ago I would have said that thread scheduling isn't an issue, but then I played the game Maneater and it's basically unplayable unless you use launch options to force the game to only P-cores. There's the Intel ""Application Optimizer (APO)"" utility but it seems abandoned and you can't add your own games if Intel hasn't added a profile. I was a big proponent of E-cores but honestly it seems like a half-baked technology that Intel never put the effort in to support properly.

It's not especially vague.   >In fact, I might be crazy but I feel like it is more likely that the actual answer to Strix Halo will be all Intel silicon, because Nvidia is very horny for all things ai and all things datacenter.  Despite that, Nvidia has already provided a custom iGPU tile for their Mediatek + Nvidia iGPU solution.   They have both the resources and financial incentive to do this. Plus, this should be better than any all intel silicon solution anyway.",Neutral
Intel,Yup and Jensen himself said the high powered SOCs is a $30 billion untapped market,Neutral
Intel,"I guess we'll see more when we get actual info about the potential devices.  Right now, I haven't read about a device coming to market.",Neutral
Intel,"should have a 3y warranty on it. submit an RMA ticket  regarding the actual query though, the silicon is the same the 14900ks is just a slightly better bin. you wouldn't notice the difference at stock let alone normalized for energy consumption",Neutral
Intel,"I have i9 14900ks, what I did is that I reset bios settings to optimized defaults and then I limit pl1 and pl2 to 150w and enabled XMP, these are the only two settings i changed, the rest is default, and temperatures are in check, i still get the same performance, and it’s very efficient in gaming that way, the extra heat and power consumption of 253 or 320 are not worth it, I recommend just get the ks and make these two changes and forget it.",Neutral
Intel,The performance difference will be tiny and definitely not noticeable with a 3090. Go for the cheaper chip.,Neutral
Intel,"Get the KS for better silicon quality only limit power , set pl1/2 253w and set it to 350 or 325A, definitely want the better 14900ks silicon quality it’s overall better and better IMC as well.

Intel,"A 14900KS is nothing more then a binned 14900K. Running a 320W/400A extreme setting is not advisable with a AIO. I run my 14900KS on custom loop with 320W/307A performance setting and it does not thermal throttle at all. If you get lucky, you could get a 14900K that can run KS settings. Performance in that case is( should be) identical. Without benchmarks i can't really tell the difference between 125/253/307 and 320/320/400 except the heating of my room.",Negative
Intel,"As an update - I went ahead with the 14900ks and also changed my cooler to a 420mm AIO.   Ensured latest bios update then set Intel presets (performance) but also went ahead and reduced PL to 150w, set temp limits to 70c, system agent voltage to 1.12, 307A, and I was blown away by the temps!! I am getting basically identical performance (+ few fps) to my previous 13900ks, but a whole whopping 30°c cooler in game!!!

Intel,Im using a duel air tower for my 14900k game temps are at 60 to 70,Neutral
Intel,"14900KS is just a better binned 14900K. All things equal, you should have lower temps/voltage/power draw for the same exact workload/clocks on a 14900ks vs a 14900k. How big of a delta between the two comes down to how well you struck the silicon lottery with the KS.",Neutral
Intel,"I have the K version only because of the onboard gpu. In case my GPU gives issues and I'll still be able to boot. But otherwise there is almost no performance gain. I ran my i9-14900k pl on 320 watt and did a cinebench benchmark, temps were ok: average 94c, max 98c with a 360 aio.  That said, go for the cheaper version if you don't need onboard gpu.  Edit: I have my pl on 253w now. No need to go any higher.",Neutral
Intel,5 years warranty on 13 and 14gens now.    I have the 13900ks. Run it at 253w. Clock locked at 5.5ghz. Temp 80c and cinebench 23 39k,Neutral
Intel,Why not keep pl2 at 253 and 1 at 150/185 ? Did you try undervolting? Most of them can take 50mv offset with 75 /85 needing a bit more stability testing. Can also cap the vr limit and iccmax. I feel like going 150 pl2 makes you miss some performance in games unless you had thermal issues and doing it to keep it from thermal throttle.,Neutral
Intel,"Thank you for the feedback. Forgive me for the dumb question; if I ran either a 14900ks or a 14900k at these settings, would they both have the same temps? Or would the KS still run hotter?",Neutral
Intel,"Dropped the voltage further down by -0.10000 and now I’m getting 58°c core temp and max 65°c package temp under load. Really happy with this, and with some tweaks to my in-game video settings I’m able to still maintain a framerate that matches my screen refresh rate.",Positive

Intel,even better. i take it they extended tbe warranty period for those products?,Positive
Intel,For 5.5 39k in CB23 is a little low,Neutral
Intel,"I have tried and tested all my games, i saw absolutely no difference between 253w, 150w, 125w or even 100w, the fps were exactly the same, the only difference was in temperatures, performance wise i saw no difference between any of them, i was using 100w before but then I switched to 150w because I thought it was too low, even though the performance is still the same as 100w, just higher temperatures, my cooler is pretty good kraken elite 360, it never goes above 80 even on 253w but I just like to keep temperatures between 50-70 while gaming.",Neutral

Mindfactory rma rate for 9800x3d is close to 0.5% which isnt close to a full recall and nominal.

I run -40 negative curve offset on my 9800x3d and it sits at 55c in games non stop and 5.4ghz all day",Negative
AMD,"Even with undervolting, you will still get voltage spikes depending on the workload. And there could be something in the CPU that was very sensitive to them.  Also, when undervolting via negative voltage curve on AMD CPUs, they will hit their max rated clock rates more frequently due to having more thermal/power headroom from the undervolting. Then using PBO raises the max allowed clock rate, which at that point changes the CPU's electrical circuit behaviors from beyond the stock setting.

AMD,"Not since 2007/2008. ASRock was spun off from ASUS around that time period, and became their own company. Both operate under their parent (Pegatron) but are independent from one another.",Neutral
AMD,What does ASUS PR statement have to do with ASRock?,Neutral
AMD,"If you go back and read my first comment, I was talking about ASRock being upfront about reaching out to AMD and not hearing anything back. All you did was quote an *ASUS* comment from the article, which doesn't pertain to ASRock.   So let me get this straight....ASRock, ASUS, MSI, and Gigabyte (few posts but nothing too substantial) are all experiencing issues with the 9000 series CPUs dying right? AMD was blaming motherboard manufactures over the Summer, and each one has released several BIOS revisions that...guess what? Aren't stopping the chips from dying.   Are you going to really sit here, and throw out the excuse that ""Ohhhh r/hardware is just trying to find any reason to blame AMD and throw trash at them!!!"". The fact of the matter is, the motherboard manufacturers don't know what the issue is. So clearly the issue definitely falls on AMD, because nobody knows what the hell is happening.",Negative
AMD,"Reading comprehension is an essential skill for becoming a functional adult and joining the workforce. You will struggle significantly in your professional life if this is how you respond on impulse.

AMD,"I am using ASUS TUF Gaming X670E-Plus WiFi, my 9800x3d died in October after being installed in February of last year. First CPU I have ever had die in 25y building personal computers...  Oddly, the CPU had some dark marks on pin contacts like it was starting to scorch, i took pictures,  I cleaned it up with alcohol to see if it'd work but that didnt fix it. Temps were ~65C under load with AIO cooler. Corsair 1000w shift PSU. Stock PSU cables.   https://imgur.com/a/vMDaEl8",Negative
AMD,"I'd prefer not to actually test how the Asus e-store where i bought my motherboard and Amazon where i bought my CPU, would coordinate liability in case both pieces of hardware get fried.",Negative
AMD,"Also it manifested in game servers (where single-threaded performance was needed).  The real issue was that Intel issue would slowly manifest. Going from occasional software bugs/crashes (often initially reported as GPU driver crashes, which Nvidia quickly blamed Intel) and then increasingly becoming unstable. I read about one game developer who got a flood of crash reports from one user, and when they told the user that their CPU was dying, the user demanded a refund and posted a negative review accusing the game of being poorly programmed.",Negative
AMD,"What are the PBO offsets, if you know? I’m on MSI which don’t seem to be having as many problems (and a 7800X3D), but I’m trying to be extra cautious lol.",Neutral

AMD,Do you have a source for the thousands?  I've seen a bunch myself but wasn't aware of that many.,Neutral
AMD,If its failing on all motherboards whats the common factor?,Neutral
AMD,Only way to run CPU’s safely is the tried and tested method of static Vcore with a droopy LLC. Any other method clearly isn’t safe,Neutral
AMD,They have to buy ram though. 50/50,Neutral
AMD,"They're still a major shareholder, like they said.",Neutral
AMD,I meant like yes they were spun off but still are quite related. Hell sometimes their boards have very similar defects.,Negative
AMD,did you undervolt or overclocked your cpu?,Neutral
AMD,Now I'm a little worried. I have the X670E-PRO and 9800X3D ... for about 10 months. I have a little bit of undervolt -10mv for a bit of performance boost.,Neutral
AMD,Haha. That's why I used overclockers for all my purchases LOL.  3-year warranty!,Positive
AMD,Obviously but it's not like you're stuck with a dead cpu if it's a problematic unit,Negative

AMD,"That hasn't been true since 2009, when ASUS sold off its last shares of Pegatron. They are not a shareholder.",Negative
AMD,"Their relation ends at the parent company, otherwise, that's pretty much it. Which defects are you referring to, outside of the current ongoing problem?  Edit: ASUS sold off its stake in Pegatron (finalized in 2012), which means they are not a major shareholder.

AMD,Kept the bios default except changing RAM from 5600 to 6000. Crucial Pro 96GB (2x48) kit.   The only undervolt I did was to the GPU when i had an AMD 9070xt. Swapped this out after a month when i was able to source a 5070ti. I dont think that would affect the CPU at all.,Neutral
AMD,"RMA process wasnt bad with AMD, I'd only worry if you bought it used or dont have a valid warranty for some other reason. They ask for proof of purchase and a photo of the product. I gave them a PDF from a downloaded invoice from Microcenter, and a photo of the CPU on its retail box. Turnaround time was 2 weeks.",Neutral
AMD,stock settings are strongly overvolted nowadays.,Neutral
AMD,Yeah?? I’m saying static Vcore with a droopy LLC is the only safe way to run CPU’s,Neutral
AMD,"That’s like saying “they are brother and sister… their relation ends at their parents, that’s pretty much it”.  You don’t get much more related as 2 companies than having the same parent company.",Neutral
AMD,Pegatron is *not* Asus' patent company. Your initial comment is incorrect.,Negative
AMD,bios default has PBO turned on and soc on auto right? i set a static 1.2v on my soc and turned of pbo due to this. i hope that helps.,Neutral
AMD,Nope. Doesn't matter at all.,Neutral
AMD,I don't think PBO is enabled by default. You have to agree to overclocking when you go to the PBO BIOS page if I remember correctly,Neutral
AMD,It does.,Neutral
AMD,Nope.,Neutral
AMD,Standard mid-cycle MSRP reset.,Neutral
AMD,6-7% price jump for even 5% performance would still be well under the usual premium charged for Halo products. I'm ok with it.,Positive
AMD,"From what I can see the cheapest 9800X3D right now online (no Microcenter deals) is $469. 6-7% price increase is fine I guess for a rumoured 7%-10% perf jump (usually value decreases for more expensive parts). Then again, I'm sure that the 9800X3D price will drop when this launches, which is welcome I guess. Maybe $400 9800X3Ds? Though that will make the 9850X3D basically DOA.   Checked, and it's at $449 in the Philippines but I guess that's more on our currency dropping in value and stores not updating prices yet lmao.",Neutral
AMD,"Might as well throw out this old R7 7800X3D, there's an entire 10 extra Minecraft FPS out there for the taking now!",Neutral

AMD,What about the 9800X3Ds dying?,Neutral
AMD,Might get this and check how well it does in the CPU limited scenarios that I have used for testing 14900KS vs 9800X3D.    9800X3D saw good gains with just RAM tuning and I believe 9850X3D will do better.,Positive
AMD,"I kinda did a stupid, got a 870e-e strix relatively cheap and now im waiting for this to hit stores. Hoping my xmp 6400 ram will work without much hastle",Negative
AMD,Gonna ride out my 7800X3D till AM6 comes out.,Neutral
AMD,bro i just bought a 9800x3d................!!!,Neutral
AMD,Hmm. Not good. Price of 9800X3D will still be $450 then.,Negative
AMD,Wasn't this CPU already out?  A step above the 9800X3D?,Neutral
AMD,"What is the actual difference between a 9800X3D and a 9850X3D? What is the purpose of this product?  Better to wait for the ""11800X3D"" or whatever it'll end up being called.",Neutral
AMD,"Really wonder if I should upgrade my 3 month old 9800X3D while these ""exist"" before Ai shitshow makes them impossible to find and probably delays the Zen6 into 2027",Negative
AMD,"That's cheaper than I expected.   I already have a 9800X3D though, so I'm waiting to see if Zen 6 will be worth upgrading to. The rumor mill says they will have +50% cores, so the 10800X3D will have 12 cores and 24 threads, that is going to be upgrade worthy for sure if the price is somewhat similar to current gen.",Neutral
AMD,The people who would consider upgrading are priced out of DDR5 so this CPU is DOA.,Neutral
AMD,"Yea, I thought there was no way they'd do 499 -  I mean for one, it's AMD, but a product like this, like a KS, normally has a stupid premium attached.  I'm surprised at anything below 549.",Negative
AMD,"They're hedging against ram prices, good move.",Positive
AMD,>Maybe $400 9800X3Ds? Though that will make the 9850X3D basically DOA.  Products like this are never DOA if they are the best thing available. Plenty of people bought 12/13/14900KS's even though it was the same thing with slightly better binning/clock speeds.,Neutral
AMD,There is zero chance this thing is anywhere NEAR 10% faster unless AMD is putting like twice the power through it.,Negative
AMD,think 3%,Neutral
AMD,It's a \~3% gaming performance improvement even by AMD's own slides.  Productivity might be closer to 7% but that's about the theoretical max what you'd see.,Positive
AMD,dude 400mhz boost (200 if you count pbo) is not going to be in the same universe with 7-10% perf jump LOL,Negative
AMD,"No it won't, it was reported this replaces the 9800X3D.",Neutral
AMD,30->40 great  290->300 meh,Positive
AMD,"Same, I'll probably ride my 7800X3D until Zen 7 releases ( apparently still on AM5 if the rumors are true ), then I'll probably grab a CPU in the X3D Zen 7 lineup and ride that until AM7.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah depending on your GPU and resolution, and the games you play, you probably get 95% of the gaming performance in real world FPS of the 9850X3D for half the price.  That's money well spent.",Positive
AMD,Well the expensive thing will be DDR5 so the price of this is irrelevant.,Neutral
AMD,"I don’t think there will be much demand, it’s basically just a replacement/refresh of the 9800X3D and most people that wanted one of those already have one.",Neutral
AMD,Amazon drop their stock today and still in stock. That is the price. Delivery date February 1st.,Neutral
AMD,"Nova Lake will basically be a full node advantage.  So in power efficiency, certainty.  In productivity, almost a certainty. You have to go to 9950 to be competitive against the 285HX (although that's on N3B)  In gaming performance, it depends, esp. on how much cache they're going to put on and how much latency their design has.  In terms of price/performance, depends on their yields.",Positive
AMD,"unless Intel has an alternative for 3d cache, it's not happening lol",Neutral
AMD,Mine is supposed to come in on the 5th,Neutral
AMD,Did you preorder? Mine says delivery 2/6-2/13. Wondering if others who preordered before me show 1/29,Neutral
AMD,Someone must be new to marketing,Neutral
AMD,All the “tests” of it were just people overclocking 9800X3Ds to match the new speed of this,Neutral
AMD,Are you thinking of the 9**9**50x3D?,Neutral
AMD,AMD’s product cycle for Zen has been pretty consistent at around 18 months. This is confirmation Zen 6 is going to be a little delayed compared to the usual cycle.,Neutral
AMD,"The purpose is that improvements in binning have allowed a clockspeed to only be achieved by a % of 9800X3D's when overclocked can now be achieved by most, so it'll be relaunched with that new clockspeed.  This gives a ""new"" product from AMD to have for the press cycle to cover because we're still several quarters away from Zen 6 (it's no coincidence review embargo for 9850X3D comes the day after PTL's)  It'll also reset ASPs on this product up by $20 without ""raising"" prices",Neutral
AMD,It serves the same purpose as what Intel's i9-KS products did.,Neutral
AMD,> What is the purpose of this product?  Make money,Neutral
AMD,The biggest mistake someone can make is waiting for next generation.,Negative
AMD,sounds like a waste of money to me,Negative
AMD,"imo, the only way that would make sense is if you could use your old cpu in another system.",Neutral
AMD,"The only one that might be worth it is the 9950X3D2 when it comes out, with dual CCD. But even then youre pretty far into niche territory. Youd have to be hitting your CPU pretty hard to max out the 3D V-cache and need a 2nd one.",Neutral
AMD,"Why do you wonder that? Of course you shouldn't. It's not even worth the effort it would take to physically swap the CPU out, let alone the money that will be wasted.",Negative
AMD,People who will spend $500 on a CPU are absolutely not 'priced out' because of memory. :/,Negative
AMD,So people who are already on AM5 but not using X3D yet don't exist?,Neutral
AMD,"I am on 7700X and happy, but I might upgrade to this chip one day",Positive
AMD,"12900K is a different chip (less cache, less E-cores, won't destroy itself, etc.). 13900K/14900K/KS/etc. are the same chip with different binning.",Neutral
AMD,"It wont be 10%, PC's scale more or less pretty linear with performance under normal conditions, a jump from 5.2Ghz all core to 5.6Ghz is a difference of 7-8% at most and that ofc only goes if the CPU is the bottleneck.",Neutral
AMD,productivity is the only reason you would get this CPU in the first place.,Neutral
AMD,"400 with PBO still, you can PBO both chips.",Neutral
AMD,"It's hard to imagine it won't, but that is still rumor.  2-4% gaming improvement and 5-7% productivity improvement isn't exactly a product segmentation step.",Negative
AMD,8.3 ms vs 0.1 ms reduction in input lag,Neutral
AMD,"Same boat. The 78x3D doesn't get the same praise as the 58x3d, but it's a considerable bump in performance and it uses so little power.   I will run this until whatever the last gen x3d on AM5 is, then probably be able to run that for 3-5 more years.",Neutral
AMD,"Just put 5 times as much DDR1 then, lmao",Neutral
AMD,Zen 6 x3D just needs a 32 GB cache.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah I would upgrade (from 5800X) and buy this, but not with the current RAM situation.  I bet these companies are pissed too. Like AMD/Intel (CPU sales), Valve (new steam machine), potentially even Apple?",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, the only real market I see for this (other than people strongly affected by FOMO who need the absolute best of the best for their system and upgrade every single time a new part comes out) are people who are just building a new system from scratch and do want the best of the best. And I don't think many people are keen on building with this current market.",Negative
AMD,"I believe they were talking about gaming performance specifically. Since you don't compare 1 SKU to an entire generation like Nova Lake.   But by the time Nova Lake releases, Zen 6 comes under contention as well.",Neutral
AMD,Do you mean 285K? Because from the reports I've seen that's what the 9950x competes with. The 9900x for 265k and such.,Neutral
AMD,"I think Nova Lake is supposed to have an equivalent, bLLC or something like that.",Neutral
AMD,"Nova Lake is supposed to have a large cache variant, although it is not 3D stacked, so the latency advantage of 3D stacking remains to be seen.",Neutral
AMD,Last rumors has Nova-Lake with 144-288 MB of bLLC depending on the model.,Neutral
AMD,"I just want to know if I should wait for Nova Lake or get a 9850. For gaming, ofc",Neutral
AMD,Maybe so.  All the naming is confusing.  Why would they release a 9950 and 9800 but not a 9850?,Neutral
AMD,"Maybe, maybe not. Zen 4 and 5 haven't stopped the seemingly endless Zen 3 releases.",Neutral
AMD,"No? Where did this myth come from, anyway? The idea of constantly waiting for whatever someone thinks the ""next gen"" is, that doesn't make any sense.  I have a 9600X now. A 9800X3D isn't that great when I know that a perfectly good upgrade is coming relatively soon. Zen 6 will also likely be the last gen on AM5, so it's not likely to get better than this. Unless society simply implodes within 2026~2027, we'll be fine.",Negative
AMD,"Nope, I would just sell the 9800x3d for $400",Neutral
AMD,"It's not a matter of how hard you're hitting it, it's the nature of the applications hitting it. Cross CCD latency is [about as ""bad"" as that of going out to RAM](https://www.overclock.net/threads/official-zen-5-owners-club-9600x-9700x-9900x-9950x.1811777/page-53?post_id=29367748#post-29367748) (both are roughly around 75ns or so, vs ~12ns for local L3 Cache), defeating the benefit of the X3D cache entirely. [There are ways to make applications that are able to intelligently allocate their own threads within a given physical CCD](https://chipsandcheese.com/p/evaluating-uniform-memory-access), but as far as I know, the means for that feature set isn't included in AMD consumer chips (there *are* multi-X3D-CCD Epyc CPUs for niche applications). Adding those features to a consumer product would mean AMD undercutting their enterprise products by thousands of dollars per unit.  That's why I'm skeptical of a dual-X3D-CCD consumer part every time it comes up. Even if they do release it, it will have to be aggressively gimped to avoid losing them a ton of money while also being a major disappointment to the people that think they want it. The more likely move would be a 9950X3D with better binned silicon like the 9850X3D is (something akin to AMD's old ""XT"" refresh skews or Intel's ""KS"" models).",Negative
AMD,Says you,Neutral
AMD,"That has nothing to do with what I said. There is a 12900KS, which is  a better binned 12900K.",Neutral
AMD,You wouldn't get a 9850X3D over a 9900X3D or 9950X3D if productivity is the thing you care about.  The 9850 would be for people who would want to pay a premium to have the marginally fastest gaming CPU.,Neutral
AMD,If you care about productivity then this is not the chip for you.  285K is 69% faster MT | 15% faster ST  9950X3D is 76% faster MT | 7% faster ST  Even 265K and 9900X3D are much better options closer to that price range.,Negative
AMD,"is this, like, confirmed?",Neutral
AMD,33% increase in frames v.s 3% increase in frames is another good way to understand why the returns diminish the further you go,Neutral
AMD,"I mean, I don't think thats true. The 7800X3D was unanimously the most praised AM5 chip when it came out and its efficiency was a core reason as to why. It's not as glazed relatively speaking because the 5800X3D was just such an anomaly. It offered 7600X performance to users that didn't want to upgrade to AM5, was very power efficient going against the 12900K, was fairly cheap for what you got AND was dropped mid cycle for AM5 when everyone would've thought AM4 was dead + people were complaining about DDR5 pricing when AM5 launched and this was a saviour.  Like, the 5800x3D really caught a perfect storm. And the 7800 did get surpassed a few years later (even if by a fairly small margin) so it loses that Halo effect for people.",Neutral
AMD,"you need to double the bandwidth for each gen (not exactly so, but a general approximation). So for DDR1 you would need 16 times as much running in 32 channel mode.",Neutral
AMD,"You could also see people who were putting off upgrading from a 7000 series part finally decide to pull the trigger. It's obviously not worth going from the 9800X3D to the 9850X3D, but if you're moving up a generation having a little bump like this can push you over the threshold to buy.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, likely X3D Zen 6 will be quite a bit after Nova Lake.  So they might take the crown, but that's the one that they have the least chance at IMO.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, sorry, brain fart. I am so sick of the terrible marketing names.",Negative
AMD,wouldnt a side cache introduce same latency issues as going to read the cache from the second CCD? in which case we know this has actual impact.,Neutral
AMD,nova lake is launching in like late 2026 and is a complete unknown  go for 9800x3d/9850x3d,Neutral
AMD,"Just wait, soon we'll have the 9950X3D2",Neutral
AMD,"The 9850X3D is just a better binned 9800X3D.  The step above the 9800X3D is the 9900X3D. You get more threads, but lower boost as it's contained within 120 W TDP.  You get 45% more productivity for 7% lower gaming performance or  90% more productivity for like 2% lower gaming performance.",Neutral
AMD,"The Zen 3 parts that are getting released were all manufactured years ago. They just didn't hit requirements, so once enough defective inventory built up, they were released as a new SKU in small numbers",Neutral
AMD,I’m in the same exact scenario. I think we can get $400 for our 9800 cpu.,Neutral
AMD,"I mean... yes? That is literally correct, I did say that.  That not withstanding, how do you justify spending ~$100 (provided you get ~$400 for your 9800X3D, and ignoring potential selling fees) for maybe 8% more FPS in the best case scenario? Are you even stressing the 9800X3D with your 9070 XT, or would you land at literally the same performance after the swap?",Neutral
AMD,"No, gaming gains here are irrelevant. Productivity gains of 7% can make enough difference to pay for itself. Productivity is the only scenario where this is useful.",Positive
AMD,Nah but id be very surprised if they weren't like all other Zen 5 chips are able to do.,Neutral
AMD,"Even then, going from 290 FPS to 386 FPS (33% increase) is a much less noticeable change than going from 30 to 40 because it's still a much lower decrease in input lag.",Neutral
AMD,"Makes sense. The 78x3d was certainly very well received. It got buy recommendations from reviewers and it was the top of the line during it's run. I got mine at the low point in it's price history for ~$300, which was a steal imo. I can't imagine anyone with this cpu will feel the need to upgrade (for gaming) for a long time.   I agree that the 58x3d was the perfect cpu for a perfect situation.",Positive
AMD,"Well, then just don't put any DDR ICs on your board, boot up from on-chip memory with a minimal bootloader, and download some more RAM onto the board from one of those webpages.",Neutral
AMD,No problem. Laptop SKUs are especially confusing.,Negative
AMD,Depends on the interconnect no? From what I know infinity fabric is the only thing that prevents cross die memory access for AMD.,Neutral
AMD,"I mean this is the same thing, they just built up enough inventory of good 9800X3D bins.",Neutral
AMD,Productivity more so cares about multi core performance and you wouldn't pick a 8 core CPU with somewhat better single core performance over a 16 core CPU like the 9950 with more than 50% higher performance.  Gaming gains are marginal/irrelevant but they will be the reason people will buy it for and it is also how it is being marketed.,Neutral
AMD,"True, I just think the raw percentages are easier for most people to understand.   Modern computing really is a marvel man. If you would've told 14yo me that one day I'd have a CPU / GPU that crushed basically everything at 1440p 180Hz and wasn't even technically the top end I would've shit lol",Neutral
AMD,"Definitely a steal. That's near 5700X3D cheap for like 30% better performance and more upgrades available.  I wouldn't be surprised if the 7800X3D lasts a decade. Though, the rumoured increase in core counts for the next gen does make it a tad less likely. It's still gonna last a damn long time though.",Positive
AMD,"Also bought it at around its all time low, had no idea. It was in May 2024 if I remember well.  Bought it because the relatively recently released Helldivers 2 was obliterating my ole trusty i7-8700, the GPU was twiddling its thumbs at as low as 35% usage.  I was considering waiting for the 9800X3D, glad I didn't.",Negative

AMD,"Summary:  “While the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 was faster overall, the Framework Desktop was consuming more power than the Dell Pro Max GB10. On average the Framework Desktop over this entire span of CPU benchmarks saw an average wall power reading of 133 Watts with a recorded peak of 227 Watts. The Dell Pro Max GB10 meanwhile had a 103 Watt average with a recorded 164 Watt peak for all of these benchmarks. So while the Framework Desktop performance geo mean was at 1.285x, the total system power consumption was 1.29x higher on average and the peak was 1.38x.  If you are investing in the Dell Pro Max GB10 or any other GB10 platform, chances are though you are running AI workloads and other software fully engaging both the CPU and GPU. The Blackwell GPU with the GB10 offers a lot more compute potential over the Radeon 8060S graphics but similarly the Dell Pro Max GB10 pricing is around $4139 USD as of writing and the Framework Desktop around $2928 USD if going for the same RAM and storage capacity. More GB10 GPU benchmarks are on the way at Phoronix.”",Neutral
AMD,I have GB10 in my lab. The real issue with my unit is thermal throttling.  When it reaches 70C throttling kicks in and the performance drops a lot. Forcing additional air using a mini blower it maintains much higher interference tokens/s.,Negative
AMD,The GPU portion will be the juicy bit,Neutral
AMD,"As someone who's mostly into applied math and stats research rather than hardware, I'm always a bit confused as to how to parse these for my own use cases. Which of these benchmarks correspond to decomposing thousands of large matrices/arrays in parallel using Python or R (which I suppose use LAPACK or something like that in the backend)?",Neutral
AMD,"Not mentioned here, but when you start going concurrent performance testing, via vLLM, the GB10 ends up being 4x to 5x faster than the Strix Halo (which itself can be quite faster with concurrency).",Neutral
AMD,"The lack of a real efficiency advantage was baffling given Nvidia/Mediatek are using an N3 node. You'd expect higher efficiency, not the same (Halo has +28% geomean performance at +29% avg power consumption).   Obviously the Nvidia chip focus is more on the GPU though.",Neutral

AMD,"That might simply be due to the fact that Strix Halo has a much wider CPU. It's 16 Big Cores + SMT.

It also does not help that GB10 is using a generation older ARM CPU cores, with less cache and a strange cluster arrangement to top it all.",Neutral
AMD,The GB10 devices come with ConnectX card that is probably responsible for some 5-10W of base load.,Neutral
AMD,DGX Spark power management is uhh a tad lacking and comes with... oddities.  It has a tendency of putting itself in really deep power states too eagerly while taking a while to wake back up: https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/connectx-7-nic-in-dgx-spark/350417/51  Wonder how much that might have affected perf results for some subtests. It _should_ have no impact on number crunching style workloads though.,Negative

AMD,The ConnectX card is the big difference maker in value as well. Connecting two is a pretty easy upgrade. If you were going to get only one then Strix Halo would be a better pick if you don't need something Nvidia specific. Even more so before the RAM prices really drove up pricing on the Framework.,Positive
AMD,"> although it's fair to point out half of those are small-ish A725 cores.  More than fair. An A725 in the GB10 has half the ST perf of their X925s, though the gap may close in nT workloads depending on how high each core is boosting there.",Neutral
AMD,Which is offset somewhat by lack of SMT and IPC of an older arm architecture,Negative
AMD,what about it?,Neutral
AMD,"Yep, the GB10's A725 are only paired with 0.5MB L2, that'd be barely larger than 1mm2, i.e. far smaller than Zen5C, similar to Intel's Mont cores  That's the same L2 MediaTek uses for the E-Cores/little-Cores (A720/C1-Pro) in their D9400/D9500  Also the GB10 has a weird asymmetric L3 cache. One X925+A725 cluster has access to 16MB L3, the other X925+A725 cluster has access to only 8MB L3.

AMD,"So no non-""premium"" laptops with AMD APUs or handhelds with AMD APUs will support FSR 4 until 2029?  That seems quite pointless.

AMD,"I said it before, you will see an Intel chip with Nvidia iGPU before you see RDNA 4 in APU.",Neutral
AMD,"But why though? Is there something inherent in RDNA 4 that prevents it from being included in APU designs, or is this just AMD not wanting to put in the work?  I personally lost interest in the new Steam Machine when I saw that it had RDNA 3.5 instead of 4. I am only one data point but there must be others like me out there.",Negative
AMD,"What's crazy to me is that one of RDNA3's biggest issues was how inefficient it was in utilizing its theoretical compute and bandwidth advantages.  And RDNA4 fixes that!  You'd think this would be perfect for a bandwidth-limited processor like an iGPU.  My best guess is still that they didn't realize how good RDNA4 would actually be, and perhaps thought their RDNA3 issues would take more to deal with.  The fact that the desktop lineup is basically only one GPU die, and then another GPU that's essentially just the one copy/pasted and glued together, along with this constant reuse of RDNA3.5 for mobile/APU's tells me they really didn't invest much into RDNA4's success at all.  Which is especially lousy for people who are really enjoying the PC handheld stuff nowadays.  I'm not one of them, but still, I'm sure RDNA4 would have been a nice improvement on this side of things.  But now it seems like Intel might be able to come in and scoop up attention for people wanting something newer and better.",Negative

AMD,"Quoting myself:  > My guess, based on what AMD has said about RDNA4 and UDNA, is that they didn't put the R&D into cutting RDNA4 down any smaller for iGPU usage. So far RDNA4 only has 2 die configs, 64 and 32cu. The 32cu config is exactly just 1/2 of the symmetrical 64cu config. And if you look at the die diagrams, it would take significant redesign to cut the size down further, far enough to fit into the space of 8-12cu RDNA3.5 spaces. >  > My guess is that UDNA is being designed for all sorts of configs, but has caused problem after problem for them... Just like every new GPU uArch family does for them. TeraScale, GCN, RDNA1. Each first iteration was a mess. I'm betting they wanted to get UDNA into iGPUs a lot sooner, and launch dGPU UDNA afterward. A guess.",Neutral

AMD,Depends what is their actual intent. They can move HX 370 to a lower price point and release RDNA 5 new thing at it original price point. That way you get more performance for budget options and more performance at the high end. Both companies refresh old generations within their new generation to have lower price options available.  Also it may be that they want to prioritize raster performance instead of DXR or fancy AI upscaling for their lower tier solutions. RDNA 3.5 got a lot of ISA changes also present in RDNA 4 but not all of them so it looks like some tailored solution.,Neutral

If the current IT scene was not ridiculously hostile for us end-users then these times would be exhilarating with powerful ultrabooks, mini PCs, handhelds, consoles with real 4K60 support, VR/AR sets and higher fidelity&quality graphics with ray/path tracing.  I am not against software based upscaling but I am more in favor of affordable pure (computation/rendering/storage) capacity.  To be honest neither Strix Halo nor very expensive IPL/B390 devices do not appeal to me.

Though it's still bizarre because it does seem AMD has \*already done\* the work to get FSR4 working on FSR3, even it might have been more effort to do so.

AMD,"Nothing “inherent”, but perhaps not worth the effort.  RDNA4 adds more transistors over RDNA3 and improves RT performance in an “area inefficient” method. (Second intersection engine) Out of order memory returns also is RT centric feature.  So on a product where you don’t care about RT, rdna4 gives little benefit for its increased transistor usage, but it did still improve raster somewhat.  Whereas RDNA3.5 vs 3 focussed exclusivity on mobile perf/watt features given that it’s not available on desktop.  Don’t think of RDNA3.5 as a sort of “half measure” between RDNA3 and 4.  It’s more of an independent evolution over 3 adding mobile centric perf/watt features and dropping the features that improve “scalability” for large configs.   There is also the market, where despite all of us wanting to see these “large iGPU” products, most of the mobile stuff really doesn’t care.  Krackan (8core 4WGP) vastly outsells Strix (12C 8WGP).  And the largest RDNA4 on mobile would be 8WGP again due to memory BW. (half configuration of 9060XT)   Intels iGPU is VERY impressive given how lacklustre their desktop iGPUs were.

They have a 64cu die, which looks like an hourglass, and 32cu die, which is 1/2 of the hourglass. It's clear that from the start it was a stop-gap design for the desktop market.   They've said it's also the end of ""RDNA,"" and the next uArch will be UDNA, a ""merger of CDNA and RDNA.""   So they didn't design RDNA4 to be modular beyond 64/32cu designs. They intended UDNA to be the follow up, and I previous wagered that since it's a ground-up uArch (like RDNA was to GCN), they're building it from the ground up to be used in any applications.   The issue is UDNA is taking longer to cook. Is that intentional? Who knows. It could be that they pulled resources to push Instinct Compute development, could be that they're having Development Hell problems, could be anything. I don't doubt AI market bullshit is to blame.

AMD,"> Krackan (8core 4WGP) vastly outsells Strix (12C 8WGP).  Part of this is cost/market segment, Strix is priced *way* up there. We're back at a point where budget/mid level Intel makes the most sense to purchase, which is where AMD was when it was burning market share. They *really* need to get their engineering & finances together to make it work if they actually want to grow.  >Intels iGPU is VERY impressive given how lacklustre their desktop iGPUs were. But I guess that’s expected when you’re using TSMC N3.  Battlemage (and soon, Celestial) launched a lot of technologies (that are, as far as I know, new and unique to Intel) and implementations (of things other vendors have had for a while). It really did put them much closer to parity--and they never had the memory bandwidth limits RDNA seems to have anyway. They really could have put in a larger GPU in if they wanted to--it seems like they will--and AMD is now announcing they won't be changing anything. TBH, I don't know what exactly possessed AMD to announce they are going to let Intel rest and recover during their nadir for the next 3 years. Only developing 1 or 2 actual iGPU's and leaving them up for the $1600+ market segment just means almost everything below that will be using Intel instead. Like... there's no imagined configuration where a dGPU model that fits in below that price would be CPU bottlenecked enough to justify reaching for the RDNA 3.5 parts, *and* using Intel means they get a better iGPU & more profit anyway.  Unless the margins on their RDNA 3.5 parts are razor thin (and TBH judging by Minisforum's PC's that's not the case!), there's just no world where they're going to be gaining market share.",Neutral

AMD,"afaik there has never been a correlation between geekbench and gaming performance, pretty lame how people eat up the headlines even if they're meaningless",Neutral
AMD,I think it depends a lot on how exactly the software/ hardware works. If the workload still has to fetch from the other CCD then it won't make a difference.,Neutral
AMD,"There's still a latency penalty since it's two separate caches, so it will still be best to keep it on one in a lot of cases.",Neutral
AMD,Yeah but there will always be one CCD that will be faster,Neutral
AMD,Its actually worse now. Because if the software uses threads from both CCDs and those threads then want to read each others cache thats a lot of extra latency.,Negative
AMD,"Age very well in isolation yes. But with zen 6 coming with a 2 node jump, much better packaging, 50% more cores and cache, frankly I'd skip this one.",Positive

AMD,"Nah, total system impact is always something we should consider, because it's the most meaningful to us as users with workloads to run and bills to pay.  The fact we can buy parts as individual units doesn't mean they should only be considered that way.",Neutral
AMD,"There are three natural points of comparison: old chip at matched power, old chip at matched performance, and buying two of them (embarrassingly parallel workloads only, obviously).  If you use the last one, you obviously need to include the power draw of everything needed to turn the chip on.",Neutral
AMD,We have had x600 vs x600X for like every ryzen generation that has had way more power for minimal performance increase.   Exiting the power sweetspot has been every enthusiasts dream buying the fastest gaming cpu on the market.   PBO being a commonly recommended feature blows past efficiency curve for minimal performance gains.  This is just a slighly better binned cpu. It doesn't feel like 14nm+++ yet.,Positive
AMD,There will almost certainly be some clock speed where it is.,Neutral
AMD,"It's not only that. There is no direct comparison. Someone (anonymous) ran the Geekbench Benchmark and uploaded the results afterwards.  Someone found that result and chose a random result of a regular 9950X3D and used that as a baseline. Both benchmarks were not run on the same system or by the same person. No one knows if these results are in any form comparable or useful.   What we don't know:   \-exact Windows version   \-power limits   \-RAM configuration    \-overclocking yes or no   \-what was the background load? You can run Geekbench while doing something else.   For all Ryzen 9 9950X3D the results differ a lot. The fastest 9950X3D entries are like 30-35% higher than the lowest ones.    The best 9950X3D results are better than the presented 9950X3D.      There is only one logical explanation for this article:   Someone wanted to cash in on the hype for the 9950X3D2 and chose some existing 9950X3D result as a baseline without any explanation.    With all the results, the 9950X3D2 is up to 30% faster or up to 5% slower than the 9950X3D, for any claim between that there would have been results to go with.   But looks like someone thought 7% is positive enough to please the AMD community but also not  so unrealistic that anyone would question the methodology.    If you look behind it, it's just made up.   Not even AI slop is that bad.    But tech/hardware media can afford that, the people who consume that are dumb enough to buy that, that's why lying/making up stories became a multi million (possibly billion) dollar industry.",Neutral
AMD,"> [Paraphrasing] >  > Some programs perform worse when split across multiple CCD because the cache is not shared between the CCD.  But... all of AMD's CPU's with multiple CCD run in to that issue and for most things can be ignored, that's not unique to the X3D design.",Negative
AMD,Good for simulation computing and games that have similar workloads. Single-threaded perf gains nothing like you said.,Neutral
AMD,I use a 7800x3D to play at 1440p and im almost always CPU bottlenecked. This is because the type of games i enjoy are  CPU bottlenecked. Even this CPU would mean im CPU bottlenecked.,Positive
AMD,"As far as i know theres no OS that can operate without operating memory, but there can be setups that utilize storage as memory. With SSDs it might even be fast enough to be usable.",Neutral
AMD,"More than that, won't any modern motherboard just refuse to POST with no RAM?",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, L4 cache is invisible to x86-64. It’s managed automatically by the processor and cannot be eg used as RAM.  There might be undocumented ways you could interact/manage this (modern processors have lots of ‘undefined’ instructions; usually used for debugging)    That is more of a design and ISA decision however. Physically it is possible.",Neutral
AMD,"You got downvoted but that’s very true, Digital Foundry does game benchmarking for CPUs perfect for that reason in my opinion. They max the RT, turn the resolution down to 1080p and turn DLSS to a low internal res, that way they’re not GPU bound but they still get all the extra CPU overhead that RT brings",Neutral
AMD,"It's the best gaming CPU in the world, and will likely be the best general productivity CPU on consumer platforms as well at launch.   Only *you* can decide if paying a lot of money for literally the best is worth it.",Positive

AMD,This is r/hardware not /r/gaminghardware   Non gaming performance is relevant lol.,Neutral
AMD,"The 7700K vs 6700K test was GPU-limited, so it not showing any significant differences isn't surprising. Similar for the 9900K test, as the 1080 Ti wasn't fast enough. The 9900K had an almost 10% frequency improvement over the 8700K at stock setttings (4.7 GHz vs 4.3 GHz all-core), with the added L3 cache there's simply no way it would be less than 10% faster.  The 8700K test shows that for CPU loads, the 7700K scored 84.0% while the 6700K was at 77.2%, that's a 9% improvement, the 8700K showed a 19% improvement over the 7700K. The 9900K showed another 19% uplift over the 8700K in the CPU test department.",Neutral

AMD,anytime bud,Neutral
AMD,"Both should be considered, but they should be decoupled when looking at benchmarks. You are right that TCO is important.",Neutral
AMD,"Well, it's supposed to have twice the 3d cache too, so that would be where the real gains are. ISO performance in non cache sensitive tasks would have even been fine, but if they want to hyper bin parts to push the performance too for a very premium price, they'll get a couple whales. I'm guessing this will be somewhat low volume as a part.",Neutral
AMD,"I mean no, you can't ignore it, that's how it works.",Neutral
AMD,You just set default to non x3d ccd and pin all games to x3d so that everything running in the background is on the non x3d cores and any non game program that needs more cores will just use both.,Neutral
AMD,"games that do simulation will all want to use combined cache so you dont want them using multiple CCDs. If you got some paralelized simulation software though, yeah it will be good.",Neutral
AMD,This exactly. Games that tend to bottleneck CPUs tend to be relatively easy to run GPU-wise and vice versa. Games that punish both heavily are extremely rare.  Depending on the types of games people play they could experience CPU bottlenecks even at 1440p or even 4K. Bannerlod and X4 I feel are great examples.,Positive
AMD,"It doesn't really matter either way since after all, the use cases are both extremely unrealistic. What matters is that the test stays consistent between benchmarks.  With benchmarks you're not trying to figure out how many frames a CPU can pump out in a game. What you're trying to figure out is how many it's pumping out vs. other CPUs (i.e. the relative performance). Because of that it doesn't really matter whether all the tested CPUs hover around 100 FPS or 600 FPS.",Negative
AMD,"That was 2 years ago (zen3 itself being almost 6 years old) and only worked out because the 5000 series GPUs only went up to 5700xt, so the naming didn't overlap. The last two generations haven't had an XT (we get 7950x instead of 7900xt).",Neutral
AMD,"When comparing 6700k vs 7700k, GNs benching showed that even synthetics like Cinebench had less than 5% MC uplift at stock and less than 6% uplift in SC. Ashes of Singularity had a 2.7% uplift. They did not compare 6700k vs 7700k OCd.   8700k becomes harder to compare because they changed testing methodology and the OCd 8700k was delidded.",Neutral
AMD,They actually peaked at zen 3 in 2021. The couple of moments when Intel was still on 14nm for the H series before Tiger Lake-H and when the Intel U series was still quad core was when Cezanne looked the most competitive.   But they never managed to fully capitalise on it due to shitty supply and shitty OEM cooperation.,Neutral
AMD,"Exactly! If you're someone frequently running special software that's significantly impacted by a split cache then you shouldn't be buying a CPU that does that.  Thankfully most software just wants more cores, higher clock speed and higher IPC with increases to cache capacity being a *bonus*. Cache being split, not shared across CCD's just doesn't factor in to it for I imagine most consumers.",Neutral
AMD,"I think he means can ignore in a sense that the penalty, while still existing, wont impact consumer experience. If the extra latency means ill open my PDF file 5ms later, thats no problem for me. Its only in heavy load software where it really becomes an issue, gaming, enterprise compute, etc.",Neutral
AMD,"You’re right that it doesn’t matter if your benchmarking is purely academic, but figuring out exactly how many frames a CPU can pump out in a game is important if you’re also looking to understand which GPU you should buy.  You still get to compare relative performance as long as you keep the benchmarks consistent like you said, but if you max the CPU then you also get a real FPS number you can compare to GPU reviews to check whether you’ll be CPU or GPU limited at your target res and settings",Neutral
AMD,"Well yeah, except for the Ryzen 5600 XT, which has the exact same number and suffix as the Radeon 5600 XT.",Neutral
AMD,We also had a 5950X. Stop trying to pretend there is any sort of consistency where there is absolutely none.,Negative
AMD,"No, you said you don't need to pin processes with this and I'm explaining why that's not true. Saying ""just ignore it"" is weird.",Negative
AMD,"in the context of this CPU i don't think anyone is worried about opening PDF files or other basic tasks. the main use case of this is people running demanding software that may benefit from the large core count and cache, in which case yeah they're going to care and be doing their research.",Neutral
AMD,I don't think a consumer is going to be so confused they buy a GPU instead of a CPU.   I doubt anyone buys these products based on model name alone without any other research.,Negative

AMD,"I feel like the real metric here is how much more Apple is selling now vs. 6 years ago. People have never made the choice between an Apple laptop with Intel, AMD, or Apple silicon- they're either buying a windows PC (where they might shop around), or they're buying an Apple product, where they get what they get.   That is to say, if Apple released an iPad that ran on Nvidia's ARM tomorrow, Nvidia would suddenly have a huge share of the tablet market within a few years, because people would keep buying iPads.

AMD,"While it's probably part of it, I doubt it's the whole story. Windows has basically been the ""worse GUI that you put up with"" for 40 years, so it continuing to be that shouldn't be that dramatic.  I think a bigger explanation is just cost. While the entry price for MacBooks hasn't moved much on paper, the entry-level MacBooks throughout the 10's were generally not ideal, and you generally wanted to go up the product ladder to get a better laptop if you could afford it, even for general usage, and once you were looking at the laptop you actually wanted, you were spending $2000 or more. That's an inherently limited audience, simply due to cost.  These days, the cheapest MacBook you can buy is extremely solid and has no major asterisks. The price of ""I want a MacBook with a high-resolution screen, a processor that's as fast as the most premium processors on the market for tasks that only need a couple of cores, and has enough RAM/storage that I don't have to worry about it"" dropped by well over $1000 in the last six years, in addition to the massive technological upgrades in new hardware generations (e.g. Coffee Lake to M4).  Notably, there hasn't been a similar cost proposition improvement on the Windows side over the same time, dramatically shifting the relative cost proposition between MacBooks and Windows laptops. This creates a massive problem for Windows, as the whole reason to put up with the ""worse GUI that you put up with"" was generally cost, as boxes that ran Windows were generally meaningfully cheaper than Microsoft's competitors over the years (Mac, OS/2, early UNIX). With MacBooks being competitive or even favorable on cost compared to nice Windows laptops, the incentive to put up with Windows anyway is just gone.",Negative

AMD,"Base model Macbooks are a good value if they meet your needs. You will not find a comparable laptop that has a similar keyboard, trackpad, processor, etc. for the price. But Apple makes their profit on the upgrades from the base model. So this would be in terms of ssd and ram. Those upgrades typically come at significant premiums and is where Apple gets its profit.   On a PC, you can typically make those upgrades yourself. And save a significant amount of money doing so. You can even upgrade your PC's monitor in certain cases. This can be useful if your laptop's screen gets broken. If you had a mac, you'd probably have to go to an Apple store and pay $$$ if that happened.

AMD,Too bad performance isnt the sole metric when deciding on CPU architecture. My point being Apple is far too small in the computing space to affect change like this. Even if their CPUs were 2x as fast. In enterprise Apple is basically non-existant.,Negative
AMD,They also decreased the price of the base Macbook and increased the minimum RAM at a great time. You could have bought a 16GB M4 Air for $800 in many places this past fall and it was an insane deal. You still can buy a Mini for $400-500 with similar specs.

That's to say, people will pay more for something that is certainly updated well, doesn't have crap janky features that are ditched after a few years, and have fully performant hardware (versus many PC laptops which will often compromise less-noticeable bits of hardware, like mics, touchpad, speakers, etc).  I'm personally not a fan of them, myself, but I absolutely see why people buy them, and often recommend them to people when they fit their needs.",Neutral

Linux is better however its support for tools can have all sorts of annoying library dependencies you can get around it via containers but its really not as smooth as Windows is. Microsoft just giving a technical user a stable and powerful OS would be nice, but now everything is a subscription, AI and ads. This is starting to infect even cars.

Just checking the numbers per [this](https://labourlawadvisor.in/blog/are-you-rich-or-poor-find-out-where-you-stand-in-indias-income-pyramid/) the median wage of India is about $2600/year and the top 1% of India’s earners make the equivalent of $20k/year.  Meanwhile in America, the bottom 10% of workers make less than $22k per year. Meaning that 90% of Americans have more purchasing power than 1% of Indians. 310M Americans vs 14M Indians. Since the upper end of income distributions tends to look pretty similar in every country, we can reasonably conclude are around 20x more people who can afford luxury electronics in America. India’s market size is more comparable to The Netherlands than America. That’s why Apple isn’t worried about lacking a share in the market there.",Neutral
AMD,"Do you do a lot of mobile gaming? I'm guessing that is the case if you're looking into laptops for it.

AMD,Yes it's equivalent to the Intel KZ line. Just run a K processor at KZ clocks to know how the KZ performs. Problem is not all K chips can reliably hit those clocks.,Neutral
AMD,"In ye olden days the answer would be, it's an extra push for people on older platforms to upgrade. But with current RAM prices even that is not really a market.

And anyone could have told you there release would probably be end of year 2026 or early 2027.   If they get pushed back to mid-late 2027 that'd be more news worthy, but not particularly surprising giving the current economic climate and slowly lengthening release cadence (this 10 years vs the 10 years before that).

AMD,"Yes, which is what they generally do in year 2 launches (RDNA4 launched in 2025 I.e year 1).",Neutral
AMD,Or they could feasibly release a 8GB 9070 GRE with the full bus and 1GB modules. And just market it under the notion that they wanted to release something as cheap as possible with current market conditions.  Would still be a decent e-sports card for a lot of title.,Neutral
AMD,AMD never refreshed their RDNA3 GPU's either.  And there's not a lot to refresh RDNA4 with anyways.  It's just the two GPU's and both already have fully enabled products with higher TDP than necessary.,Negative

AMD,"Maybe AMD has learned that giving their teams more time to cook isn't a bad thing. There are no shortage of other reasons why delaying makes sense for this year in particular as well. The world will keep turning whether RDNA 5 comes out in Q4, or 2027.",Neutral
AMD,"Oh I just bought a 5060Ti 16GB a few weeks ago to start a new build.

AMD,Time to get the old RX 580 8GB out of the drawer.  Ten thousand years.,Neutral
AMD,"No, they lack the memory density. A card has only a handful of slots for memory chips to go, most cards have the same number of slots.

It's not worth complaining about, and especially not right now.

AMD,"Compared to my 890M based laptop, the 890M numbers here are about 15-20% lower than what I'm seeing at the same settings.  This is likely due to power targets?  Even if the uplift is just 60% instead of 80%, that's still an impressive achievement for the B390M.  It's a shame that AMD appears to have dropped the iGPU ball in 2026.  Relying on the Strix Halo is not an option here.  It's pretty much impossible to find a good laptops that use it.  The upcoming HX470, and still without FSR4, isn't going to close the apparent large gap.  It seems that AMD forgot to stay hungry and they'll end up losing whatever ground that they'd gained in the last few years.  Mind you, Intel is known to play pressure games with laptop makers too in order to limit AMD adoption, which just makes it even crazier that AMD isn't doing what's required to keep the pressure on.",Negative
AMD,"I think the B390 could be faster than even an RTX 5050 35W (As it could beat an RTX 4050 at 60W).       These thin and light laptops that Panther Lake is built for use way underpowered GPUs. Honestly, it makes sense why the Dell XPS 14 only has the B390 graphics. Before it used an RTX 4050, but it ran at just 30W of power.       Now that Integrated Graphics have beat the -50 Tier of GPUs I don't think we'll even see an RTX 6050 or RX 9050",Positive
AMD,"They've basically maxed out the 128-bit normal socket iGPU now.  For them to beat it they need more memory bandwidth - they can put in a bit more cache, but realistically they'll need a quad channel bus (or maybe they can wait for LPDDR6 at 14.4+).  They can probably have a bit more physical room in the next generation of sockets, but without more bandwidth it isn't *that* useful.",Neutral

Strix Point at launch had little products (Asus being the only OEM per usual) and yet they still continue to grow, at a smaller scale relative to Intel.

Intel is really dependent on CCG, it is double in revenue to DCAI. They invest in what makes them money. Compared to AMD, client and DCAI is doing well, for client CPUs and GPUs are doing well, putting no pressure in mobile, in fact their strategy has remained the same in the past couple the years and even if marginally their % share is sufficient for them. Intel pushes a lot of supply for mobile, while AMD is smaller, it is all relative in the necessary investments they need to make in order to supply demand.

AMD,"I dunno Battlemage was a big step forward on driver compatibility and every month Intel improves all their Arc compatibility. I'd be honestly surprised if Xe3 was worse than their current offerings. I'm sure it still has shortcomings as all Intel GPUs will because they're simply starting fresh, but even my A750 is pretty good right now at playing anything I throw at it.  The only aspect Intel kind of messed up that annoys me is their video encoder, once it gets pegged to 100%, it absolutely tanks your performance on the capture to the point where it skips frames and lags. It never used to do that and the driver also used to include capture software, now they just offload it to people having to download OBS and removed the capture aspect of the driver. Kind of dumb when both NVIDIA and AMD include it as a driver option.",Negative

In practice, it'll be more like trading 2 P cores for 4 lpE cores  edit: to be more specific, In ARL-H, below 5W per core, E cores outperform P cores.

AMD,"They announced a first party Strix Halo PC at CES, but it'll probably be really expensive.",Neutral
AMD,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips. But if you want true performance, just go out and buy an RTX X060 series laptop it's far better price to perf each generation.",Neutral

AMD,"QC last year had a bad product.  It was competitive vs AMD and Intel but Qc was selling those for 50% less than Intel or AMD chips. OEMs at first decided to price these at Intel prices then it settled at Intel -100/200€   QC laptops still sold what QC and partners expected and OEMs are increasing new models for X2 (design wins went from 60 to 100+)   X2 has a 25% advantage vs Panther Lake and it will still be cheaper because QC is an underdog. If QC captures market share and reaches 10-15%, then Intel will start to sweat and then margins will be hit. I don't think QC gets anywhere near that till like 2028/2029. The laptop market is VERY slow to move. AMD had a better product for several generations and it only netted them +10%   While QC and Mediatek/Nvidia don't hit a bigger marketshare number.

AMD are being more reactive, I'm guessing they are betting on having a lower price ceiling for GDDR6 than Nvidia's GDDR7, so while they'll potentially take more of a hit in the immediate term, there will be long term gains when they are still delivering similar volume of product to market at only a moderate price premium.

Console APUs are an entirely different beast to regular ones. Intel has to have something like Strix Halo to show it can truly compete.   Companies won't trade away years of partnership just because another company has good products now. Intel might genuinely have to take a loss to get APU contracts. AMD has also never had an issue supplying the volume Xbox and PS need.

Intel compares their igpu to a power limited laptop 4050 (and they lose still by like 10% iirc). AMDs Halo is compared to desktop 4060 in quite a few cases. That's a huge difference.  Yes, Panther Lake is a great igpu. It's not close at all in raw performance. It's got more advanced technology for sure and its RT performance is very impressive for what it is. But it's also a much newer architecture and it's lucky for them that they are in a transition period for AMD where AMD is unable to put their latest architecture in mobile chips.  Intel's fabs have lost them money. I'm not sure they're gonna bring better value for money. AMDs architecture is just better and they can use less advanced nodes if they so wish.

There's a whole section in the article about the applicability of the Ozaki scheme:  > Even if Nvidia can overcome the potential pitfalls of FP64 emulation, it doesn't change the fact that the method is only useful for a subset of HPC applications that rely on dense general matrix multiply (DGEMM) operations. > > According to Malaya, for somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of HPC workloads, emulation offers little to no benefit.  > > ""In our analysis the vast majority of real HPC workloads rely on vector FMA, not DGEMM,"" he said.

AMD,"Well, you got a point, I phrased that badly.   No, HPL is a politically motivated benchmark with zero applicability in the real world that causes real harm to the HPC world and is horrendously expensive to run.    If you're interested in this, here is a slightly longer explanation (It's a slightly modified copy paste from a different explanation from me, so some things might seem a bit off to you)  It was created to ""prove"" performance claims by manufactures. Back in the day even CPUs had a claimed theoretical max performance, usually in GFLOPS. But what does it even mean and where does this number come from? It tells you how many floating point operations (typically 64 bit) a processor can theoretically do. It's calculated by core count \* clockspeed \* fp operations per cycle. So, it tells you how many operations the CPU can do if every single clock cycle was used to calculate as many operations as theoretically possible per cycle. For modern CPUs, lets use a 7950X as an example: It has 16 cores, runs at a base frequency of 4.5GHz, has two 256 vector ALUs and supports FMA (fused multiply add, performs two operations in one cycle), so it's two operations per cycle on 8 (2x 256bit = 8x 64bit) FP per core on 16 cores 4.5G times per second. So 4.5 x 16 x 8 x 2 = 1152GFLOPS. The same math applies to GPUs where the performance claim is usually still marketed.   HPL is a benchmark that was created to get as close as possible to this number. It's designed to minimize overhead, memory, networking etc, and use 100% speedup from wider vector units etc. And not only that, every single manufacturer has their own optimized HPL version. On intel CPUs you run an intel optimized version on AMD an AMD optimized version etc. To get back to the example, [here](https://wp-cdn.pugetsystems.com/2022/08/hpl-zen4.png) is a test from puget systems with a result of 1011GFLOPS which means a \~87% efficiency.    And that's basically the thing, the more time you spend optimizing, the closer you get to the optimum which is about 85-95% of theoretical maximum. And not only that, if you spend enough time optimizing and distributing load, you can even throw in a GPU and add the performance to the total performance. It's essentially just about how much time you're willing to invest into it.   The problem is, none of that translates into any real world performance. This [chart](https://www.pugetsystems.com/pic_disp.php?id=68180) shows how random many results seem to be (intel dominates there because of their early AVX 512 adoption). In the real world, especially in HPC the software is far more complex and more I/O, network and memory dependent than pure compute bound.    There isn't a single common HPC workload that scales with performance as HPL does, none.   The benchmark exists for the top500 list and to ""validate"" the performance claims. It's for politics, to be able to say ""our supercomputer is faster than yours"".",Negative
AMD,> Blackwell offers ~37TFLOPS in native FP64 and up to >200TFLOPS in some scenarios with emulated FP64.  Only when doing matrix x matrix multiplication. Matrix x vector or anything else would fall back to native.    It all depends on the needs of the customer 🤷‍♂️,Neutral

AMD,"(2/2 I hit the comment length limit)  And that's where the problem starts. I did work at a super computer place at a time where they were looking for a new system. Because most scientific super computers are paid by the state/city/whatever and it's a political thing, HPL is a real problem because politicians want to see results and they only care about HPL and where it lands in the top 500 list.   Thing is that running HPL is horrendously expensive. If you want good results you can easily spend like 2-4 weeks on optimizing and benchmarking, which doesn't sound too bad until you realize that if a supercomputer is used for 5 years, that's 1-2% of the whole lifetime and therefore cost.   Next problem is that GPUs are still not that great in HPC and a lot still runs on CPUs for many different reasons. The place I worked at had zero uses for GPUs as their main software had no GPU support. They had some, mostly for analyzing results (and visualization) that was purely built on CUDA. But GPUs offer like 10x the performance in HPL compared to a CPU socket and are far more cost effective.   But money came from politics and they didn't want a rather small uplift (plans were to spend a lot on networking and storage) and therefore they had to buy some GPU racks and spend less on storage and CPU nodes. And because AMD GPUs were faster at that time in HPL, there was pressure to buy AMD GPUs (which they didn't but they bought a lot of nvidia GPUs).   I can't speak for all supercomputers but at least to me it's not surpring how much more successful AMD is with their datacenter GPUs in the Top500 list (which AMD likes to say for marketing reasons).

AMD,"There's some heavy lack of research here that's making it that way.  Research has taken the path of least resistance here, there's some tradeoff with FP4, FP8, FP16 etc... but there's been little incentive to do *interesting* research in this area because it's way easier to just change the format than to figure out what isn't being captured in a neural network as a result.  Could more complicated activation functions that wouldn't work on low precision hardware but could do more obviate the need for lower precision neural network acceleration hardware?  Maybe, but no one is really looking into that. architecturally, it's dead simple to add fp4 to hardware compared to paying for the research for alternatives, tensor cores in general are dead simple architectural improvements compared to almost anything else on the GPU stack.   Nvidia added sparse tensor operations in ampere, found that their models didn't need half their values and they could be re-trained with out half the nodes and perform about as well. That should have deeper implications (maybe networks shouldn't be homogeneously connected, an architecture which heavily benefits for GPUs, but with out would make it much harder to compute on GPUs) but Nvidia just kind of ignored it and moved on.",Negative

AMD,Or just the fact that the RTX 50 series supports NVFP4.,Neutral
AMD,"That quote is very vague - the architecture shown there is also a hybrid model, just not a hybrid CNN-Transformer. I can't find AMD actually confirming this anywhere (it's free PR to say it's transformer based, after all) and have seen some people running with that quote by linking it with largely unrelated papers claiming that CNNs struggle with long term dependencies, no good with FP8, etc, when these algorithms have vastly better information to work from and aren't single-image approaches.   Not only does FSR4 predict kernels which are perfectly reasonable with FP8 but part of how FSR4's architecture works is by using clever reprojection tricks to reproject state information into the network to give it longer history. This sounds like a very well informed design trying to maximise a small CNN. I'm not sure there's any transformer component to speak of even in the FP8 model but you are right to say that the leaked code wasn't the final model. Maybe there's some better information somewhere.",Neutral
AMD,"The footprint is actually slightly smaller than Preset M. Ray reconstruction is somewhere in the middle. Difference are negligible though we're talking 2-5MB.  At least based on the DLSS programming guides it looks like the models have the same size, they're just tuned for very different outcomes.",Neutral
AMD,"This is a dumb take.   The math is not that complicated.

AMD,"Thank you for this info. I've edited post to avoid spreading misinformation and speculation.  I don't think just Redditors and Tech netizens are to blame. You can look at how NVIDIA marketed CNN vs ViT from the original DLSS4 transformer Geforce blog posts. Could be summed up as :   \- CNN = tile by tile basis/myopic and really poor tracking of dependencies over time and across frame   \- Transformer = analysis entire frame and excellent tracking of dependencies over time and across frame.  I think another reason why most people thought it was transformer was that IIRC FSR4 is even more demanding to run than Preset K and J despite using FP8. People could not conceive of a CNN model running this poorly when NVIDIA CNN models run fast, but then again didn't Sony's PSSR also have serious issues with performance overhead?   Maybe this is a FSR4 and Ray regeneration are both early beta releases. But regardless of what you think it's clear NVIDIA has the lead in terms of talent and design. AMD and everyone else is fighting an uphill battle against DLSS fs.  That's interesting. Yes the FRS4 INT8 leaked model seems pretty solid overall.  No I doubt it. AMD isn't disclosing anything. Even less forthcoming than NVIDIA. A bit surprising given their historical commitments to open source.",Neutral
AMD,No L is still better than M regardless of the input resolution. Its actually a really large difference from my testing. Some games with boiling noise on M feel almost unplayable vs K. while L minimizes it and has all the other 4.5 benefits.  The reason it's recommended for ultra performance is because its more heavy to run than M. But on my 5090 the difference is usually just a couple frames tbh,Positive
AMD,"Yes, M is recommended only for use with Performance mode right now - if using balanced/quality, it's recommended to still use K.  And L is only for the niche Ultra Performance use case.",Neutral
AMD,"Its clear you're just copying and pasting an argument you heard about going beyond double precision float, this argument is not even remotely relevant here.  You simply don't understand just how low precision fp8 or even fp4 is.  You can only represent 16 different possible values period with fp4, and it's even more restrictive because the mantissa only occupies one single bit in that representation, so to a human it appears even worse than 16 values   I suggest attempting to do any non trivial math using fp4 (or heck, even trivial math!) and compare that to even fp16.  The reason fp4 works at all for neural networks is because the shape of the function matters way more than the actual value in an activation function, and it's gone to the point of simply using bits instead of fp4/8 etc... however at the same time the trend has been simplifying activation functions as simple as possible which complements this approach, and virtually all research in activation functions has been towards this simplification process.  If you could instead do more work per activation function you might be able to go the other direction, more complicated activation functions, but smaller overall neural networks by node size.  This however is not possible which such abysmally small floating point types.",Negative

AMD,Don't think they are that cartoonishly evil. We have not seen Nvidia go with that short of an adoption rate with RTX gens before.,Negative
AMD,"Not trying to be pedantic, sorry for all the edits 😅 I was very curious about FSR4 model too, all these upscalers exist with a gulf in knowledge about their architecture! Ended up falling down a rabbit hole on relearning how FSR2 worked. The black box of it all makes it very frustrating and ends up in semantics war.  NVIDIA are right with their marketing, it seems CNN models are often augmented with help from motion vectors to avoid needing to learn motion reprojection (FSR4 does it, and so did [DLSS 2](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-dlss-2-0-a-big-leap-in-ai-rendering/)). I'm guessing the transformer model is able to learn this itself and that's why it's so much sharper and handles animated textures better. It's not that the sentiment is wrong, just it's not indicative one way or another - DLSS3 got very far with a CNN and FSR4 is (imo) better yet. What AMD has achieved combining a lightweight model with previous FSR insights is very impressive and isn't any less impressive if it's not transformer based.  I would be very curious to know why DLSS is faster - despite its additional complexity, it definitely is faster, but AMD claim otherwise. Their listed performance figures are [optimistic](https://gpuopen.com/manuals/fsr_sdk/techniques/super-resolution-ml/#performance), if those numbers could be achieved that would've been very impressive. Less than DLSS4, more than DLSS3.5 which is somewhere near where the model visually performs. Wonder if there's some overhead and the actual FSR4 passes do genuinely run that quickly. Regardless I would hope that AMD can upgrade to a more modern model, they should have the compute for it! Maybe the software stack isn't there yet.  I really hope they are at least experimenting with transformers. It does seem like despite no public information, many of these upscaling models end up following practices set by NVIDIA. I would love to see a competent RR alternative but we all remember how the CNN variant looked 🫠  Edit: forgot that FSR4 already uses FP8, wonder how much compute is left if they used a bigger model..",Neutral
AMD,"… I’m a ML engineer and I literally have a [comment yesterday about AdamW optimizer hyperparameters](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/s/QoBWhc0Z2l) being ideal at 1E-8. And of course the AdamW (or modern Muon) would be the most bit sensitive part where you’re doing learning at fp32, before QAT.  Tell me more about basic bit count knowledge?  There are bitnet models that literally just use 3 values: -1, 0, 1. Those are 1.58 bits per parameter. You realize everyone knows the direction of the neuron matters a lot more than the amount? Why do you think OpenAI released gpt-oss as fp4?",Neutral
AMD,"Do you suspect FP8 + moving from logarithmic to linear space is the culprit behind some of the image quality regressions we've seem with DLSS 4.5?   With RR ViT they also said they used FP8 to train the model. I assume they repeated that with DLSS 4.5, so the new model is 100% FP8, no FP16 it seems.  NVFP4 could still work, it's not regular FP4 or MXFP4, yes there's a bit of overhead but it gets very close in accuracy to FP8, so NVIDIA might still opt to use it for DLSS5 training.  The idea is interesting and might be the kind of paradigm shift that can provide us with another DLSS 3.7 -> DLSS 4 increase in image quality. Would be a shame if ViT's and chasing ever smaller formats is the end goal for DLSS and other image upscalers.",Neutral
AMD,That's not how it works. A feature needs to be able to run on *any* 4000 series GPU to be enabled. There has to be feature parity between all the SKUs of the same architecture.,Neutral
AMD,I mean it just doesn't have the AI cores to do it realistically. And literally only the 4090 everything below it definitely can't do it so it's probably not worth spending millions to make a feature only a few people who own the 4090 can use.,Negative
AMD,Being cartoonishly evil has nothing to do with it. They are a corporation and for corporations only thing that matters are profits.,Negative
AMD,"No worries. If anyone is pedantic then it's me xD  That's very interesting and I would be interested to see how it would handles a purely driver based implementation (Like NIS, except with preset L).  AMD's claims are wrong. You can look at the percentage wise performance scaling of upscalers in Hardware Unboxed's 9070XT review. DLSS4 is superior in IQ (but like you said it beats DLSS 3.7) and ms overhead.  IIRC FSR4 generally is a lot softer than DLSS4 being much closer to DLSS 3.7. That might be an indication of it not being ViT but this is just a guess. But DLSS3.7 -> DLSS 4.5 is almost like a glasses on vs off situation in many games in terms of motion clarity.   Yes that seems odd but doubt we'll understand why that is.  Hmm. IDK but the MB number for 4K are roughly the same as (within 10MB) as preset J and K despite using FP8. If I extrapolate preset J and K numbers based on 40/50 -> 20/30 series MB scaling DLSS preset J and K could sit at \~230MB.   Now this means very little if it's not the same architecture and even if it is as we've seen with Preset L, M, and RR those have the same MB footprint but wildly different ms overhead. So this is probably a waste of time.  Also as a side note you can see here just how efficient the old DLSS CNN model is. [https://www.studocu.com/en-gb/document/middlesex-university-london/games-fundamentals-2/dlss-programming-guide-release/120964782](https://www.studocu.com/en-gb/document/middlesex-university-london/games-fundamentals-2/dlss-programming-guide-release/120964782)   \- Sorry for link but can't find old download on Github + internet archive won't load it.   Footprint at 4K is \~200MB and 2080 TI and 3070 ms cost from CNN to Preset J/K is more than doubled, and roughly doubled for the rest of the cards. Now I do know that FSR4 is generally in between DLSS 3.7 and DLSS4, but getting a model inferior to DLSS4 that runs with a higher cost despite using FP8 is def not a situation where AMD wants to lay back and be complacent. They still have a lot of work ahead of themselves and it'll only get worse nextgen when NVIDIA moves the goal post yet again.",Neutral
AMD,"There is research showing the right QAT approach can achieve 2-bit models without any real accuracy loss. Now that is regarding LLMs and not image related tasks like what DLSS does  but I would be surprised if it isnt somewhat transferable.   I'm referring to the ParetoQ paper. You mentioned bitnet which also showed similar results using ternary weights.  Also, I feel like most people dont understand that the main benefit of quantization is memory bandwidth related not compute related. Meaning if we are bottlenecked by memory bandwidth quantization can lead to significant speed ups (if the hardware natively supports low precision instructions). If we are compute bound quantization probably isnt the best remedy.",Neutral
AMD,"> Do you suspect FP8 + moving from logarithmic to linear space is the culprit behind some of the image quality regressions we've seem with DLSS 4.5?  I do not believe so, but I may be wrong.  In my opinion this is likely just due to training.    Basically every model upgrade Nvidia tries to address issues where people have had problems in specific games.  For example, they might notice many people are complaining about ghosting from small particle effects and the like.  So in addition to making models larger/more powerful, they throw in more datasets meant to correct that specific deficit when they train their new models.  But there's no guarantee that each model is going to be able to produce the same results with out regression.  So any new training could change the model causing regressions, and training for specific scenarios could shift weights in ways that may mess up another area.  There's not really any specific way they can fix this beyond training more, this is just an inherent problem with up-scaling using AI.     In theory they have some sort of model testing system to find these kinds of regressions, but it's impossible to account for every single scenario, networks aren't procedural algorithms, so they can fail in unexpected/unpredictable ways.   FP4, and smaller representations will probably lead to larger networks with better quality in the same amount of space if Nvidia chooses to use them, my point though was research in ML in general has been myopic and focused on the lowest hanging fruit to the neglect of other plausible avenues of making more compact neural networks.",Neutral
AMD,"> I mean it just doesn't have the AI cores to do it realistically> but Nvidia just kind of ignored it and moved on.  The excuse for a lack of 4x MFG had nothing to do with tensor cores, but image motion vector/optical flow hardware which dates back to ampere.   This is hard to validate since Nvidia hasn't really exposed what exactly the hardware that supposedly does the optical flow analysis actually is capable of/does or how they've upgraded it in other generations of cards so we have to take their word for it.   >  And literally only the 4090 everything below it definitely can't do it so it's probably not worth spending millions to make a feature only a few people who own the 4090 can use.

AMD,"16GB (2x8GB) is plenty to run the games you mention I’m running both of these games with a 10 year old Acer laptop with an Intel i5 processor 8GB ddr4 (maybe ddr3?) RAM and an ancient AMD Radeon processor with 500MB VRAM and they work perfectly, so I’d suggest save some money now as RAM is very pricey currently and upgrade to 32 when you need to, which from your post is likely to be a good few years yet.",Positive
AMD,"no no ! 16gb dual channel means two sticks of 8gb, if you get single channel i.e one stick of 16gb it will be slower so avoid the single channel setup (one 16gb stick) i could have advised 32gb but you are not a workstation user plus there are some games recently who are using 11-12gbs of ram but you are not gonna play those as you said so 16gb js fine",Negative
AMD,"They should be included together. 9 times out of 10, if you buy 32GB at a time it should be 2 16s",Neutral
AMD,DDR5 doesn't have an 8gb stick i think.,Negative
AMD,alright thank you! i’ll keep that in mind!,Positive
AMD,alright! thank you so much!,Positive
AMD,"Great deal. Honestly, I don't understand how they are making money from this.",Positive
AMD,I'd buy this in a heartbeat if it wasn't sold out at my local MC.,Neutral

AMD,"lol what’s the point of this, it’s been sold out basically since the start. Who still has these?",Negative
AMD,"I always thought dual-channel is a must, am i out of touch and why?",Neutral
AMD,Sold out really quickly at my local MC,Neutral
AMD,Fantastic deal,Neutral
AMD,why not buy 2 for that price and in a few months double your investment,Neutral
AMD,"$300 for 7500x3d is nuts, right?",Neutral
AMD,"Saw this in my email the other day, great deal. MC is the bomb",Positive
AMD,"Inventory bought before the hike Im guessing, or this MC isn’t moving anything at all and they’re just trying to get people in the door",Negative
AMD,"It's definitely a good thing to have, but RAMageddon doesn't give us the courtesy of being picky about our RAM.",Negative
AMD,"It's not as bad on DDR5. Still not ideal, but it's not the end of the world.",Negative
AMD,"Congratulations, you found the upsell.",Neutral
AMD,microcenter used things like this to attract the type of people that will come for a deal and leave with a $1500 3d printer also.,Neutral
AMD,"It's a Microcenter, so I expect it's the former. Get it while it lasts!!",Neutral
AMD,"If you pull the cooler off cold, there is some chance the old CPU will stick to it and get pulled out along with it. Can help if you run a game for a few minutes to loosen the thermal paste a bit before taking it apart.",Neutral
AMD,"If this is your first upgrade since you built it, make sure to take pictures of how and where everything is plugged up for reference. Also, the gpu latch on the PCIE slot can be a bitch to unlatch. A wooden chopstick can help in getting it to release",Neutral
AMD,5700X3D 2070S to 5070. It is insane jump at 1440P plays everything I want and need at 144FPS max settings. You are in a good hands with such setup,Positive
AMD,where are you planning on getting the 5700x3d,Neutral
AMD,"I upgraded to 5700x3d from the 3700x, and my next upgrade will be gpu. Also thinking 5070, but I just don't need it yet. I play 3440x1440p, 144hz, and in the games I play everything runs above 120fps.",Neutral
AMD,"I did a similar upgrade, 5600g+3060ti to 5700X3D+5070. It's a huge jump in performance at 1440p!  Just make sure your BIOS is up to date, and when you first boot to windows, go to the nvidia app, select reinstall drivers, and choose ""clean install,"" since it will delete the old drivers and install just the new ones  Enjoy the upgrade!",Positive
AMD,Huge jump in performance. Theres only a 10-20% difference between the 5800x3d and a 7800x3d. Enjoy the new DLSS on the 5070 also.,Positive
AMD,"Just to be safe, it doesn't hurt to have a fresh boot drive of windows ready. I recently switched out my Ryzen 5 3600 and 2070 super for a 5800xt and 5070ti... I didn't update my bios properly and for some reason when I put my old CPU back in to download the bios USB, I didn't have windows",Neutral
AMD,Good idea!   I didn't think of that,Positive
AMD,Oh man. You just saved me!  I just realized it got me flipped somewhere to a 78003xd. Not sure how because I was definitely looking for the 5700.  Oof. Now to find a reasonable replacement,Negative
AMD,Oof!  Thanks for the heads up,Positive
AMD,I would have a bios update saved to a USB and a windows install on a separate just to be safe.,Neutral
AMD,"you'll need XMP voltages, your kit appears to be 1.4V. i suggest you enable XMP or EXPO, but set the speed down to 3600. then raise it a little bit at a time until it's unstable. you can work up by +200mhz at first",Neutral
AMD,Par for the course for am5 CPUs and 2 dimms per channel.,Neutral
AMD,"Mostlikely it should work at 4800mhz, but remember that memory training on am5 can take upto 20min and longer, deppending on amount of ram sticks and what kinda ram etc",Neutral
AMD,"Check out Game Tech Reviews on YouTube, he has a couple of videos on this.",Neutral
AMD,Awesome! I'll give it a try! Thanks!,Positive
AMD,7950X with 4x 48GB @ 5200 here   I enabled DOCP I in the MB and thats it.,Neutral
AMD,gpu's still decent but that cpu's gonna start wheezing soon. grab a 5600x or 7600x depending on your budget and watch everything get smoother.,Positive
AMD,"i would go with a CPU upgrade first, something like the 5600 can be had for relatively cheap",Neutral
AMD,"Depends on what program/game you find lacking.    Is your SSD almost full?    In this current environment, maybe add a SATA HDD if you need more storage space.    But with some searching, a new SSD might still be the better option.    If you play at 1440P or higher, then likely a new GPU would be the most helpful.    If you play at 1080P or lower, then likely a new CPU would see the most improvement.",Neutral
AMD,"Agree with others, get a 5600 or 5600x. If you are playing AAA games you can get a better gpu but if you play cpu bound online games, your next move should be switching to AM5 system.",Neutral
AMD,Wait 1-2 years for ram to be at a normal price and upgrade to am5,Neutral
AMD,"Yes its normal. CPUs are boosting super fast, even if you only opening one more browser tab. Maybe just increase your fan curve just to start at 65 degrees. You can dm me and i will show your my fan curve from fan control (7500F and its the same behavior)",Neutral
AMD,"Your fan curve probably needs to be tweaked-  Like it hits a certain temp, that temp apikes your fans, which cool the cpu enough to make the fans drop- cycle repeats.  Increase your stepdown and make the curve more gradual",Neutral
AMD,"Totally normal, totally fine, been the case for like 15+ years, now. The every 30 seconds bit is odd, but it's probably just some background task repeating, and not a bit deal.  Don't use single cores for controlling fans, and you'll be alright. You should have multiple values to choose from for all cores, the package temp, etc.. The cores can change loads, speeds, and temps way faster than your cooling can adapt.",Neutral
AMD,"Thanks. I should clarify that for the testing I'm doing now, the fan control is not being used. Just the bios controlled fan curves are in use. Is it typical for just one core to go up then down due to the fans?",Neutral
AMD,"I wouldnt say normal, but I can definately understand how it could happen.  Raise your curves and increase step down and it should be fine",Neutral
AMD,"Get an SSD. 16gb will get you by just fine. When the time comes try to find a matching stick to the one you already have. It’s not recommended to mix and match sticks, but if you can find the same stick you have with same specs it shouldn’t hurt too bad.   Just know a 512gb ssd will fill up fast with games. Absolutely go for a 1tb.",Positive
AMD,Quite a predicament since DDR5 isnt as bottlenecked as DDR4 using only 1 stick but im not sure. Do you have fast enough wifi to keep uninstalling/reinstalling. Do you only play certain games or what,Neutral
AMD,"I would get the SSD and upgrade the RAM when prices come down. 16 GB of RAM is the bare minimum for most games these days, but it will work.",Neutral
AMD,"SSD. Save up and get 16gb more ram later.   Heads up too. If you’re in the US, check your local Walmarts for SSD. They sell really good deals though limited supply. I got a 1tb NVME for $66. Also check out PC sales subreddits constantly.",Positive
AMD,I'd get more storage. The prices for storage has come up but no where near as much as RAM I'd get some more storage before the prices increase. If they come down it wouldn't be a waste since storage tends to stick with you for a long time.,Neutral
AMD,"Get an ssd, check your local Walmarts in person for good deals if you’re lucky. I just got a 1tb 990 pro with heatsink for like $110 the other day, had to drive to multiple stores.",Positive
AMD,"I would go for a larger SSD. RAM determines your performance, but if you run out of space that's a whole new headache. Not sure about your place but where I'm from SSD prices are not as insane as RAM. Of course if you're running Minecraft only then yea RAM would be better, but trust me, you'll probably want to start downloading games once you get your build",Neutral
AMD,The one stick of ram will get you gaming. You can always thrown in a second stick later. Swapping out games non stop would be more of a hassle than the potential performance difference.,Neutral
AMD,Get 1 tb of storage. 16 gb is okay. You can upgrade the RAM in the future.,Neutral
AMD,"While having only one RAM module isn't ideal, I'd still choose the SSD. 16GB will be more than enough until you can buy the other one.",Neutral
AMD,"get the storage bc 1x16 gb is not even that bad, most budget builds have that amount of ram and you could do alot more with less ram and more storage plus 1x16gb stick of ram that you have will run most games smoothly even though its only single channel but a 1tb or 2tb ssd will push u further with more space to run games, download shit, save stuff, make docs etc etc etc. GET THE SSD!!!",Negative
AMD,"If u play only fps , go for more ram. If u only play offline/campaign games, go for more space.  Particularly i would go for 32gb ram, i only play a few games and i can always uninstall and install the offline ones",Neutral
AMD,"Good build, get 1 TB as 512 is doodoo for games, you don’t really need an 850W PSU, a 650 will do just fine",Positive
AMD,"If you are planning to use the PC for gaming, then you'll need the storage more. 16 GB of ram is good enough for gaming. 32gb is better, but not necessary. Games however are large enough that you will want atleast 1TB of storage",Neutral
AMD,"Prioritize storage, you can install whatever you want if you can get the largest one that you can afford. Cause later on if you decide to upgrade, you’re going to have to reinstall everything, cloning isn’t perfect. Also if you limit yourself to something like a 512GB drive, you don’t want to keep alternating games and such; not to mention that larger drives have a higher TBW.  The amount of memory you have is doable.",Neutral
AMD,"I’m assuming OP is referring to the M.2 SSDs. Depending on what kind of games you play, it may be worth looking at internal SATA SSDs if the M.2 are too expensive.",Neutral
AMD,You're going to want dual channel ram to get full performance from your cpu,Neutral
AMD,I'd be inclined to go for the RAM first. It feels like the RAM price run-up will be going on for a while; Worst case with storage you can get a cheap enclosure and store things on a portable if you have a spare HDD lying around.   I'd count on that 16GB stick costing 30 to 50 percent more in 5-6 months as opposed to a 1TB NVME. Check your Walmarts for mis-marked SSDs too; I got a PNY 2TB 2.5 inch for 97 dollars last week.,Neutral
AMD,"If anything my main game is Minecraft, I’m also in a moving situation so I can’t assemble anything until late March.",Neutral
AMD,"I would personally recommend upgrading ssd. I have rx 9060 xt 16GB and i5 12400, and 1 stick of 16GB ddr4 ram. It works just fine.  My monitor is 1080p, and I am able to play cyberpunk 2077 on ultra at 90-100fps and Jedi survivor on epic settings at 100+ fps with Raytracing.  Ram will not be a bottleneck for you as of right now. SSD will surely be better option to go with right now and you can upgrade ram later when prices balance or when you save up to buy one.",Positive
AMD,dude if your main game is minecraft rn u do not need to upgrade if u dont have anything else to upgrde just do storage. most games will run on single channel 1x16gb stick of ram fine anyways :D,Positive
AMD,"That's why I suggest the SSD upgrade, and RAM later. My daughter plays minecraft and Roblox games on her 16GB DDR4 system without any issues.",Negative
AMD,"I like this build only thing I would swap are the motherboard, maybe look for the X version as in the Gigabyte B850 Gaming X WIFI6E",Neutral

Expect to pay around $350 for 32GB of RAM. Get a DDR5 6000 CL36 kit, 4800 CL40 is unreasonably slow.  Quieter PSU.  No reason to buy a 4070 Ti, last gen GPU. 5070 Ti is $900 which is bad value. RX 9070 XT at $720 is the wise choice.",Neutral
AMD,"Going for air cooler and maybe B650E board, you can save $100+.",Neutral
AMD,"Great build, change the motherboard to the x gaming. Same price but much better. As to the GPU , anything good is going to cost. But it depends on your gaming resolution, and types of games played. This will determine if you can go ""cheaper"" or have to fork out some major money",Positive
AMD,"If it is for primarily gaming, suggest you to go for 9070 xt.  For saving costs, you could try other brands of ssd. Samsung is usually on the expensive side. You could get away with just 1x16 gb 6000mt/s cl30- cl 32 ram, if your setup is mainly gaming.",Neutral
AMD,Do you think it would cut down on my cost for my PC?,Neutral
AMD,Also I never understood but what does it mean when RAM goes like this line of numbers 36-36-38-80,Negative
AMD,The thing is I am trying to make it cheaper since I’m trying to avoid reaching 2k 😅  Also the power supplies make noise? 🧐  I picked the nautilus because I’ve just heard good things about it,Neutral
AMD,Is it really that much better compared to the nautilus? I found a new one for $80,Positive
AMD,"FPS games, GoW, Dark souls games, Skyrim, GTA, Black Myth Wukong, Cyberpunk, borderlands, and a bunch of different franchises & games",Neutral
AMD,I am trying to do gaming and programming,Neutral
AMD,"No, it would probably be the same price. Idk why gigabyte does this but they always have 2 boards with very similar names but one is just better in every way.   Now if u wanted to cut costs then I would look at the MSI PRO B850-S WIFI6E in terms of quality its pretty similar to the X version I mentioned before and while it doesnt look as nice it has a great VRM and decent heating coverage along with a good IO selections ussually coming in around the $150ish price range",Neutral
AMD,"Those are the primary timings, measured in clock cycles.  Meaning a 6000 CL36 kit has considerably lower latency than a 4800 CL40 kit and more bandwidth.   Something like 6000 CL30 would be ideal but since RAM prices tripled that is not practical anymore.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, power supplies have a fan. I have not seen a good review of the Toughpower GT 850, but the Pure Power 13M is one of the quietest on the market.  360mm AIO is just wasting $90. It won't make your CPU faster, a $40 air cooler can handle the 7800X3D with minimal noise.",Positive
AMD,AIO is pretty much for the aesthetics. $50 Air cooler works just fine. Just a suggestion if you want to save some $.,Positive
AMD,"1080p , 4k etc. That is what depends on your gpu. Some ""cheap"" you are ok for 1080p fps, but struggle with ,4k.",Neutral
AMD,Is there going to be lot of gpu dependent programming?   If you are ready to tinker 9070 xt is still viable. But it would be best to use 4070 ti. RTX 5070 and rtx 4070 ti super is also a good option at that price.,Neutral
AMD,"Alright thank you for the advice, I will look deeper into it",Positive
AMD,"Tbh it didn’t even tell me the specific GT, it just said GT  What’s your opinion on a silent ninja fan?",Neutral
AMD,"Ah I see, I was tryna go a little bit asthetics because my PC is a little too basic",Negative
AMD,I’mma go for a ASRock 9070 or 9060 xt steel legend (I like the design of it even though for programming it’s not too great),Positive
AMD,"Tbh, I don’t think so for my classes but I also don’t know the professors well yet since I’m new to the college or who teaches what.  So I’mma just be on the safe side and say yes. I am gonna be using it somewhat more for gaming though",Neutral
AMD,no problem also if ur goal is to make it cheaper then instead of corsair maybe look at some  Thermalright coolers even if u still want an AIO u should check out one of the Thermalright AQUA ELITE ARGB coolers or the Thermalright Frozen Warframe PRO if u want an LCD,Neutral
AMD,"You will have to be more specific, ""silent ninja fan"" is not a product I know.  There is the Scythe Ninja 5 which is a CPU cooler. You mean that?",Neutral
AMD,9070 is very good. Might be overkill.,Positive
AMD,"Then just go for nvidia options. Usually programming is cpu heavy task. But AI, ML and few other thing rely more on the gpu. AMD gpu support for these is poor. Not the same for AMD cpu. You have chosen good cpu, so no problem there.",Negative

AMD,The problem is I’ve been looking for 4070 ti for ages and no luck compared to the 9070 or 9060 xt,Negative
AMD,"yeah, honestly not bad at all",Positive
AMD,"Otherwise go for rtx 5070. If that is out of your price range, then go for rtx 5060 it 16 gb. AMD has technically has lot of performamce capability but  software compatibility outside of gaming is very limited. It is possible but requires a lot of work.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes! Sadly I can’t buy because of snow and a little bit of ice on the roads so stores closed down, sad days 😭",Negative
AMD,So is that why it has upscaling?,Neutral
AMD,Both have upscaling. Nvidia's is called dlss and amd's is called fsr.,Neutral
AMD,Ahhh,Neutral

AMD,"Any brand GPU will work with your setup, doesn't matter (just make sure the length of whatever GPU you get will fin in your case, measurements are online)  Your in a great spot since the 2060 is so old lol. Anything you get will be a huge upgrade. Don't listen to all the doom and gloom people saying you NEED 16gb of vram. Of course, if you can save slightly more and get a 12 or 16gb card do it,but if you just can't,you'll be alright   I believe in your case, a 5060 will do great. HUGE improvement over your 2060.

AMD,Consider this take on the relevance of AM4 cpu's being paired with current gpu's: https://youtu.be/40VOHPQ6YQE?si=5f79-bYqo62mb60g  TL:dr - AM4 is still relevant.,Neutral
AMD,I second this  Even with a 5070 Ti/9070xt it seems people are getting along just fine at 1440p with 5800x. Though I would consider a 5700x3D for those two gpu’s.,Positive
AMD,Where would one find said 5700x3d?,Neutral
AMD,"Thats a pretty decent build. You could save on the cpu cooler if you wanted, but it doesnt make a huge difference. Cod is pretty terribly optimized so 90fps isn't very surprising, and that was probably at high settings without upscaling. In practice you'd likely get better fps than that. Just use windows, you dont need to buy a key for it though. There are many ways to get one for free, or for cheap online, or just never activate in the first place.",Positive

AMD,"Whats the use case? Win 11 is really the only real option for a new gaming PC, i would swap to a dual tower air cooler as they perform almost as well without the risk of failure. I'm not 100% on all the parts and the prices quoted but do have a shop around the brands for price. Also if your pluging into a router for example their may be a cheaper version of mobo without built in wi-fi. 16 gb is considered on the lower side (i know i know whatever happened to optimisation etc) but with ram prices ATM... If its an issue you can buy another matching pair later if the mobo has 4 slots.  Unless someone who literally tracks PC part prices for a living looks at this or someone building the exact same spec machine its really hard to know prices ATM.

AMD,what is the diffrence between 9600 and 9600x,Neutral
AMD,how much,Neutral
AMD,Yeah. It's gonna be hard to build a system for much cheaper at the moment. It is a great first pc that will play practically any game you want it to (the ram will definitely be one of the biggest limitations). You didn't mention what resolution or refresh rate your monitor is.,Positive
AMD,I'd say its a good price. I personally would skip Windows due to so much cheaper to buy afterwards but just remember to get a usb with Windows installation on it,Positive
AMD,WHAT IS IT FOR,Neutral
AMD,The x version offers higher clock speeds and more chances to overclock allowing higher and smoother frame rates however it doesn't include a CPU cooler so you'd have to buy one separately,Neutral

AMD,"Not worth it to buy a 8gb card in 2026, hoping it will carry you years into the future. I don't know what partisan cope you're smoking to make that more attractive than a 12gb card. You must have never run out of vram before - it is the worst case scenario, and a 12gb card for a low price is far superior to an 8gb card that costs more, for that reason. The value proposition just doesn't check out.  Beyond that, the B580 perform well, even in 1440p. I live with someone that uses one and the hate they get seems very much overblown by partisan pc brand wars.",Negative

AMD,"I love my 9070 non xt. It runs very cool, has solid OC potential. Low power draw means you can use a less potent psu. Performance is decent at 4k and solid at 1440",Positive
AMD,"The performance gap between the 9070 and 9070 XT is honestly not as huge as people make it out to be, maybe 10-15% in most games. At 1440p high settings you're still gonna get solid framerates with the regular 9070     If saving that extra cash means you can actually finish your build sooner rather than waiting months, I'd just go with the non-XT and call it a day. You can always upgrade down the line when prices aren't completely bonkers",Neutral
AMD,The one you have money for,Neutral
AMD,"I like that 9070 will run at 220w while xt will run at 300w, while only being 10%ish slower. 32% lower power consumption, 10% lower performance. I'll take that any day.   But to be fair, I live in Phoenix AZ, with a SFFPC, so hot rigs are not fun.",Neutral
AMD,Nothing wrong with the non xt. I had a 6700 non xt and was really happy with how quiet and cool it ran. Most purple were saying to get the 9070xt mainly cause the non xt didn't go down in price enough. Might as well pay $50 for something better. If you see a fair bit of a decrease where you are then do that.,Positive
AMD,"I picked the 9070 specifically because I wanted a GPU that would be below 200W during gaming, with a bit of tweaking to power, my 9070 runs at a max of 195W, at 1440p I can run any game without issue, and I run RT in Cyberpunk 2077 and still get 80-90FPS on average with FSR balanced mode.",Positive
AMD,non-XT serves me really well. I went with it because the XT is around 25% more expensive and I love power efficient GPU.   > but is the actual difference that massive?  [around 10% fps difference on average](https://youtu.be/YWUqsqcM4Hs?si=8ZRhNp8x-zxmzHrQ&t=818),Positive
AMD,"There are a lot of factors were missing too. Factors like the games your playing, which monitor you have, what your other hardware you have, and if/when you're planning on upgrading, will all have a huge impact on accurate recommendations in a vacuum.  But considering it's your first PC, and you need to save for it to that degree, in this economy, my advice is neither. Save your money and get a used RTX 3070 on eBay. About 1/3 the price for about 2/3 the performance, and don't worry, it'll still crush 1440p in most games if you're not too greedy with the settings.",Neutral
AMD,"I have a non-xt.  It's pretty great.  If the cost difference matters to you, you won't be leaving much behind in terms of performance.  I generally get 100FPS+ on my 3440x1440 display with most any game on higher settings.  I might have to turn this or that down on occasion, but I never feel like I'm missing anything with my setup.  I'm in a SFFPC case, so I was willing to trade peak performance for the lower heat generation, and I feel like I've found a good balance there.",Positive
AMD,"I have a sapphire nitro+ 9070, and I couldn't be happier with the performance at 1440p.  For an extra 100w of power usage you are getting about 10-15% more performance with a 9070xt over a 9070 but when you are already hitting 100+ fps in games it's not a huge deal.  Avatar: Frontiers of pandora runs at over 100 on high  Indiana jones and the great circle runs at over 100 on high  Fortnite on max settings including raytracing is over 130fps.   Honestly, the only problem with going for the 9070 over the 9070XT is most of the focus goes to the XT version so you'll see way more people talking about that in videos and such.",Positive
AMD,with the ability to easily flash the bios now I think that makes the 9070 even more appealing,Positive
AMD,"GPUs are probably only going to get more expensive with AI and reduced production, so make of that as you will. Assuming nothing changes things won't improve until around 2028, so personality id get the xt if you can afford it, makes your rig a little more futureproof and now is probably the lowest price it'll be for a while.",Negative
AMD,"at 1440p high settings the non-xt will be plenty fine, you're looking at like 15-20% performance difference which sounds bigger than it feels when you're actually playing. if you're not chasing 144+ fps or maxing everything out, save the money and don't think about it again.",Neutral
AMD,"My brother in Gaben buy the one you can afford. If you keep waiting they will go out of stock, then down the line you will regret it. If you have the money, and want to buy it now, just do it.",Neutral

AMD,"Get the XT if you can.  Honestly you're going to eventually play something that's barely running at 55 FPS, and at that moment you would really wish you bought the XT and had that little extra power.",Neutral
AMD,you are tight on dough so you need future-proofing. 9070xt.,Neutral
AMD,I was looking at RX 9070s but ultimately couldn't justify the expense. However they will be excellent 1440p or 4K gaming GPUs.,Neutral
AMD,"I got myself a 9060xt 16gb because 9070(xt) is just about double the price where I'm from, and with that money I could upgrade to a much better gpu a few years down the road.",Positive
AMD,"I got a 9070 non XT and I'm honestly really happy with it. The performance difference isn't that big, and it is a lot more efficient. I play 1440p, most things on very high/max, it handles everything great.",Positive
AMD,"Can't remember where I first heard this, but the best (insert part here), is the one that you can afford. And the regular 9070 is still a modern, mid-high end GPU. I have the 9070xt, and it's been running all of my games at 1440p, maxed settings, and barely breaking a sweat, so I can't imagine the regular 9070 would be all that much different. You'll be fine.",Positive
AMD,I'm really happy with my 9070 - as mentioned in other comments it is one of the best performance per watt cards on the market. 220W instead of 304W with the XT for only 10-15% performance loss is worth it for me.,Positive
AMD,9070 non-xt is very high on the performance/dollar scale at the moment. It's slightly slower but you get a lot more for your money.,Positive
AMD,"Ray Tracing is becoming non optional with new AAA games. 9070 XT is about 10% better then the non XT, so you decide if that's worth the extra money to you. Personally I would go for RTX 5070 instead of the non XT 9070, DLSS 4.5 is really good and it's even cheaper.",Positive
AMD,Consider the 9060xt 16gb. What monitor do you have. That really matters! 1080p-1440p-4k is a huge difference. As is the frequency. Doesn’t matter if your GPU can push 600fps if your monitor can only output 120fps. I’d rather get a 9060xt 16gb and a monitor upgrade than a 9070 or 9070xt.,Neutral
AMD,"It depends on your objective. Obviously get your ram asap. Check out the used market for that. That will save you tons. I’m always about getting a bit more performance than you think you need so your system will have longevity. But getting going can be a greater good, so don’t think you need to wait. The 9070 will serve you well. I did a few builds. The 9060xt system I built for their mom’s house does great for what they play. I have a 3060ti that still works great for a lot of what they play. My other two, 7900xtx and 9070xt are overkill, but the 3060ti was struggling, and certainly can’t do 4k on the 32 in screens I have. It’s on a 1440p screen.",Positive
AMD,"gtx 970, smirkcat",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah it's a beast of a card, and i don't know why but i haven't seen people having issues with their 9070. About the XT i read it all the time. Might be simply because the XT is much more popular, who knows.  I was actually just messing around with undervolting and OCing the 9070 and managed to run it upto 3200 seemed pretty stable so far.",Positive
AMD,On average it's about 13% or 11 FPS difference at 1440p.  9070 is way more power efficient too.,Positive
AMD,"Got a regular 9070 on 1440 myself, eats everything I throw at it. Even pathtracing in 2077 is playable with FSR4.",Neutral
AMD,"I think the reason people make it out to be such a big difference is because in a lot of places the price difference is only about €50 and the more expensive models of the 9070 are selling for more than the cheapest 9070 XT models.  In the Netherlands at the reputable stores, the 9070 is selling for €650 to €780 (with most models being €700 or more), while the 9070 XT is selling for €700 to €900.",Neutral
AMD,prices will never decrease on gpus only increase with the value of gold. Sacrifice something else to make the difference happen for an XT.,Neutral
AMD,"I mean you could just set a -25% power limit in adrenaline and it will bring it down to around 220 with more performance. If the price is close enough, the xt is the way to go. But the 9070 is a beast too if that's what you want.",Neutral
AMD,"This matches my experience at 3440x1440 in our SFFPC (Fractal Terra). The 9070 does a great job. We have a 5070 Ti in the other PC and unless you have an FPS counter on, the differences aren't perceptible in most games.",Positive
AMD,That 15-20% performance difference only makes since at 4k at 1440p is whatever cheapest gpu,Neutral
AMD,"This! Or a 3070 or 4060 ti, nearly the same performance, but $100+ cheaper yet on eBay. If you're at the point where you need to save for a couple of months to get a GPU, you probably shouldn't be getting one, and if you do, you should get the cheapest thing you can get away with that gives you the performance you want.",Neutral
AMD,"For a couple months the XT was available below MSRP while it's competition, the 5070 ti was $200 more expensive. So everyone and their grandmother bought one (me included)",Neutral
AMD,"Indeed, 9070 uses 220W, while 9070XT uses 305W. That's space heater level energy usage for at most 15% more frames.   I would get the 9070, save on psu, fans and electricity now, and save on your air conditioning in the summer.",Neutral
AMD,"same here, ended up getting one for $480 on black friday, thatll be it for the next few years for me.",Neutral
AMD,"You can get offline and line interactive UPSs with pure sinewave inverters, theyre just a little more expensive.  For calculating what size you'd need, you will need to figure out the power consumption of your pc as well as any extras (like monitors) you plan on having plugged in. I tend to recommend just getting a 1500va unit though, more run time and they dont cost that much more than a 1000 or 850va.",Neutral
AMD,"You probably won't need more than like 800 watts including the monitor, depending on how old and big it is.",Neutral
AMD,"I did some research, but unfortunately, there is no manufacturer or supplier of the model you mentioned in my country. Even if there were, they would be low-quality models. What do you think I should do in this situation? Should I buy a line-interactive one?

AMD,"I live in Turkey, and as citizens, we are not treated like ‘human beings’. That's why the electrical infrastructure is so poor.   I have the Schneider 1000VA line interactive model in mind.   To be honest, I don't trust my power supply because it's the first time I've used a power supply from this brand. I honestly don't know how this PSU will work with a UPS. My only goal is to be able to shut down my computer properly during power outages. I don't think I'll be using the battery for minutes on end, which is why I chose the 1000VA model.",Negative
AMD,"Schneider here in the states is APC. They've got a pretty good reputation, I would trust it personally.  Its pretty hard to find stuff specifically sold in turkey, outside of the data center specific stuff from vertiv and tescom.

AMD,"During the issues with Intel 14th Gen, ASUS released hotfixes BIOS updates as beta releases. However, this also required agreeing to terms stating the warranty was void if you accepted the “beta” update. Failing to install the hotfix would lead to eventual CPU failure.  It got some media attention (namely, Gamers Nexus), and ASUS claimed this was not an attempt to prevent warranty claims. They claim it was released as BETA to deliver the update as quick as possible; likely avoiding a number of required and lengthy QA steps.",Neutral

AMD,Eh its been a year and not even gn can find why. At this point these people that are reporting failures aren't being honest. I've had my 870x and 9800x3d and it's fine. We really don't know what the affected numbers are. It could be under 1% which is the standard for tech.,Negative

Maybe these people arent being honest on how they built their pc. I had a 11700k memory controller fry do I blame the manufacturer or the person that built it at abs.

AMD,It depends on what resolution your TV is and what refresh rate it has.  Can your PC handle those? If it's just slightly under specifications you may experience problems. Try downscaling the TV resolution in Windows or your OS settings.,Neutral
AMD,Yes. You need to turn off the BenQ when using the tv.  Radeon cards have a known issue where displaying multiple monitors that don't have the same refresh rate and resolution causes them to freak out. My 7900 xtx goes from using 15w and a ram clock speed of 50Mhz at idle to  80w and 2500Mhz when either the resolution or refresh rate on my 2nd monitor doesn't match my primary. There's a noticeable difference in some games.,Neutral
AMD,Resolution is 4k (added those Infos right now) So I can set the resolution iset different resolutions or does that rule to every screen?,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah I don't think the 6600 is reliable for 4k, try down scaling the graphics in your OS settings to 1440p or even better 1080p.",Negative
AMD,"Okay, hopefully it helps.Thx <3",Positive
AMD,It’s good but 3060 is better because it has 12gb Vram,Positive
AMD,"It depends on what you want out of it, I'd expect it to run any given game about as well to a little better than an xbox series S",Neutral
AMD,"Depends on the price, as any other thing. If we are talking used in the US, the 6600 will be one of the cheapest cards you can buy.   I whole heatedly disagree with u/Exclavamor on almost every point he made. The 3060 is a horrid value that you should not bother looking at if you want an alternative to the 6600. Its doesn't perform any better, its 12GB is a actual trick, but yeah DLSS is nice and will net you a lot more out of any RTX GPU. There are better RTX cards, for less. Main alternative will probably be the 2070/2070Super. Without knowing your budget. On the AMD side, the 6600xt is a nice bump up in performance over the base 6600. I would recommend trying to get the XT at least.",Negative
AMD,"yeah its a fine one, similar to the 3060",Positive
AMD,"do you think they're of similar price? I found one online that goes like 70 USD which seems too good to be true, and I can buy the 6600 for around 100-110 USD",Neutral
AMD,"The monitor I have gotten is 1080p and 244hz. I don't care much for quality, as I said in the thread with Exclav I've been primarily gaming with low quality graphics. I would settle on mid graphics if it was much cheaper. I'm pretty much just looking at the cheapest card I can buy that is relatively future proof (ideally 2-4 years, not gonna complain if more ofc)",Negative
AMD,"Having 12gb Vram is not a trick, sure Rtx 3060 has slow performance to use the full potential of having 12gb Vram but at least it can make the games run more smoothly without experiencing stutter or losing performance because lacking of Vram especially with the newest driver update to use Dlss 4 on older card is nicely added feature from NVIDIA, meanwhile RX 6xxx series is still stuck using FSR 2 while FSR 4 is exclusive for their newest GPU entry.",Neutral
AMD,For better ray tracing performance with the newest driver update so you can use dlss 4.5 with rtx 3060 definitely worth it for extra cost 👍,Positive
AMD,"On this topic, what're your thoughts on the 2060 and 2070?",Neutral
AMD,it's a bit out of budget but I'll look around for it,Neutral
AMD,"Honestly graphics quality doesn't worry me so much. Pretty much my entire gaming history I've played on low graphics and have come to appreciate low end graphics as opposed to the photo realistic bias most triple A studios have now. So if you have any suggestions with 8 gb VRAM that isn't the 6600 I'll be interested, just need something more in my budget (below 100 USD)",Positive
AMD,"It’s not just about graphics quality but it also about future proofing since RDNA 2 card like rx 6xxx series is already in EoL(End of Life) stage, we can never know if AMD is still gonna support the card in the future also you will stuck using FSR 2 for upscaling with rx 6600 meanwhile RTX 3060 got a driver update so it can use dlss 4 for better upscaling performance",Neutral
AMD,Is there any budget graphics cards that can be supported in the future?,Neutral
AMD,You can try rtx 3050 or 2060 but it perform worse than rx 6600 in raw performance,Negative
AMD,do you think the rtx 2060 is relatively future proof? Looks like a great budget 3060 that can pretty much accomplish most of what the 3060 does (maybe 10-20% less performance),Positive
AMD,"Don’t know about that but I saw that card run terribly worse with the newest dlss 4 update, probably for safe measure you should go for rtx 3050 instead.",Negative

AMD,"Do you play games that can go higher than 170 fps at 1440p?   Do you watch videos in 4K or do any work on the PC that would benefit from a bigger screen with higher resolution?  If not, then you aren't getting much use of a better monitor.",Neutral
AMD,upgrade to what ?,Neutral
AMD,That’s what I wasn’t sure about. Not so much if the specs could get better but if maybe there’s a better brand or if flat would be better than curved,Neutral
AMD,Idk haha. Just curious if there is a better monitor out there for my set up or if this one is good enough. I bought the monitor a few years ago and just got the PC,Neutral

AMD,"VSCode? Python?... these are development utilities you *could* also use for developing ""AI"". I guess its a way of telling the user ""Look, i know nvidia has cuda and all... but you can now also train shit with our gpus aswell!""  This is a nice convenience box.",Positive
AMD,"At lwast it's opt in, not opt out...",Neutral
AMD,"This post is kinda the result of AI being a buzzword that has lost all meaning.  Don't know all of that stuff, but the ones I do recognize are developer tools, to write your own neural network (or code in general). Notably not even necessarily generative AI, I used them for example to write a network that would remove noise from CT-scans as part of my thesis.  As for why they come with your GPU, that stuff often needs to run on a GPU and the longest time only NVIDIA had actual support with their CUDA-api. So this might be AMD informing people about them catching up; in a bit of a clumsy way to be fair.  But others have said, it does not require additional user interactions to not have it, so I would not be bothered by it personally.",Neutral
AMD,This for using AI models on your local pc. It has not much to do with the big AI provider which are causing the higher hardware prices. With 20GB vram + 32GB ram you can use a 20B model or smaller models with higher context sizes with usable output.,Neutral

They will always be side product.   Current AI market is bloated by bullshit useless AI apps a tool. I know that it's frustrating and I feel it to. It's a bubble that needs to pop.

AMD,"You realise it doesn't use the 34GB (or even download it) if you don't tick the box, right?",Neutral
AMD,"Afaik they don't actually include the AI bundle as in it will download that stuff only if you want it. I think the main reason for AMD doing this is simply to make their GPU more appealing to the AI crowd since right now when you want to do AI, people (including me) always say ""go with Nvidia"" which is honestly still true. I would be very happy if this push will make more AI devs not only make their AI solution work on AMD GPU but actually optimize it to run good on AMD.  I know if you don't care about AI then this will be annoying to you, but you can't deny that the demand for AI is there and AMD is trying hard to catch up to Nvidia.   I wish they would also pay attention to other productivity stuff tho, like using their GPU for rendering in Blender is still a lot slower than the spec suggested, thus there is a potential for more optimization.  Also I really want AMD to make the Vulkan version of FSR4 and just let the RDNA3 GPU run FSR4 upscaling even if it is just running the FP8 version in FP16 thus slow. I would rather see a slow FP8 version running on RDNA3 vs nothing.",Neutral

Companies like OpenAI farm huge amounts of data and use legal loopholes to use people's data for training. It is quite honestly a hellscape, but what they're doing here is showing you that your AMD GPU is actually a legitimate option for running this stuff locally and not necessarily having to rely on a service like ChatGPT.

AMD,"I agree this looks a lot like AMd trying to make the point that you can run all the major AI tools, although if it's anything like doing it on a Mac, some things are pretty hit and miss",Neutral
AMD,"Exactly, and it's pretty sweet open source stuff. Most people messing around with AI models on their home computer are using gaming graphics cards to do so, much better performance on a GPU vs CPU",Positive
AMD,tbf it just makes the process of setting your own models 5 steps more easily which isnt bad at all.,Positive
AMD,"That was my first thought too, but then... why would I want anything else than my GPU driver when downloading my GPU driver ? I hope it's not ticked by default.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah I straight up returned my 7900 XTX in favor of 4080S a couple years ago because it didn't work as well with Stable Diffusion and RVC as even my older 3070, despite far more VRAM. So there are definitely people who did indeed ask for this.",Negative

AMD,"Yeah, they are getting a disproportionate amount of hate for this. I get hating big AI companies like OpenAI and xAI for polluting communities, consuming copious amounts of electricity, and collecting way more personal data than they have any right to, but none of this applies to running open source models locally on your computer.  Environmentally, it isn't any more harmful than playing a demanding game, and you also have the benefits of privacy, Nothing leaves your computer.",Negative
AMD,"For people that use local AI, it also addresses one of the biggest complaints with Radeon cards. Before, you'd have to jump through so many hoops to get something like ComfyUI working (at least on Windows). You'd need to install dependencies, HIP SDKs, certain versions of Python, ZLUDA (an emulated version of CUDA) and do a bunch of command line shit just to get it working.  Because of this, people would overwhelmingly recommend buying Nvidia for AI work because it was plug and play. You downloaded it and it worked.  The point of this AI bundle is to finally bring that plug and play experience to Radeon owners. I don't know if I'll actually need any of this (I already have the portable install of ComfyUI and LM Studio running through Vulkan), but it does make it way easier for people who do want to run AI locally on their card to do so without any fuss.",Neutral

AMD,Fsr 4 performance mode beats fsr 3 quality in many title with foliage at 4k.,Neutral
AMD,"I've been using FSR4 on a 7900XT via Optiscaler, and it's not so bad. Idk how well DLSS4.5 runs so I can't speak to that, but the performance dip really isn't that bad and the quality jump is insane. ""Performance"" FSR4, even on INT8, looks better than ""Quality"" FSR3 or earlier.  Because of that, I've been able to get the same or better results on all but the most demanding games. There are exceptions; Borderlands 4 saw something like a 10-15 FPS drop. But that seemed to be a BL4 problem as other demanding games (even ones on UE5, such as Oblivion Remastered) ran fine.",Positive
AMD,"Not true. 7900 XT and XTX would have no trouble using FSR 4, at least at 1440p",Neutral
AMD,all new apus come with rdna 3 and 3.5 ever the 395 max. 4060 performance.,Neutral
AMD,"No, I use mods that enable FSR 4 and it's perfectally usable in every game I got it working. The performance hit didn't bother me at all.",Positive
AMD,"Have you even looked into it, performance is wsy better than dlss4.5 on 20 and 30 series, its similar or better than dlss4.0 on 20 and 30",Positive
AMD,so it would gimp the 7900xtx?,Neutral
AMD,"Because this is simply not true  It's very much worth it, atleast in my experience, maybe on 6000 it's too much, but on 7000, or atleast a 7900xt it would definitely be a nice to have",Positive
AMD,"That’s not really true. It’s gotten better and better with more community optimisations and presumably AMD could do a lot more.  Also much like DLSS 4.5 more options is never a bad thing. I’ve seen people with a 2080 use ultra performance mode combined with preset L to get surprisingly good image quality in path trace titles. Meanwhile, I’ve seen people with something like a 3090 TI just use preset M and brute force the image quality improvements as basically a native anti-aliasing alternative.   This is why I’m so against this AMD style of thinking where they know best or Nvidia for that matter with frame generation which now could very well run on the 20 and 30 series after they removed the need for flow rate acceleration in their new model but they haven’t done that. I’m sure there are some CPU bound games that could deliver a good experience even on the 20 and 30 series cards but because Nvidia is greedy or Nvidia thinks they know best they haven’t done that.",Positive
AMD,"The penalty is when comparing to FSR3 performance, not native render. I get 42-45 fps in cyberpunk 2k/all max/rt max/pt off and just enabling quality fsr3 gives me +30ish fps. I wouldn’t care if it gave me +20fps but actually good image quality instead",Negative
AMD,"DLSS 4.5 works quite well on my 3060ti. I've been using it in Cyberpunk 2077 since they released it. Yes, it drops the performance down just a little bit, but it's not much.",Positive
AMD,Impractical? Nonsense. Both INT8 and FP8 are very performant.,Positive
AMD,I have so much respect for you for the edit. Most wouldn't even check and just double down,Positive
AMD,Respect the edit,Neutral
AMD,"DLSS4 runs just fine on older and weak RTX cards also 4.5 can be acceptable in some titles, but apparently AMD can't keep up with DLSS 4.0 quality. In terms of FrameGen even Intel has way better one.",Positive
AMD,"It's not just nice, it's amazing, people have been struggling to run all those models on AMD for years. If I had this I'd still have my 6900xt, instead of overpriced 3090",Positive
AMD,"Ah yes, the Norton antivirus special",Neutral
AMD,The Microsoft way.,Neutral
AMD,"I actually like it. I use PyTorch for work.  Being able to use the game driver and have current version ROCm support is amazing to me. Before that, my option was a like, 3 months old experimental driver if I wanted ROCm 7.1. Which lacked many optimizations (such as, making framegen work without crashes in wilds).",Positive
AMD,"bro its out of context but, 96 gb ddr5 god damn",Negative
AMD,Honestly trying to setup cuda and tensorflow is such I nightmare I’d click that box immediately,Neutral
AMD,"Calling pytorch just a dependency of modern AI applications is a bit wild. PyTorch is an open-source framework for anything AI-related. It's used in academia for so much.  And yes, the bundle there bundles the newest ROCm version (7.2) which is a large stepup from ROCm <7.",Neutral
AMD,"Dude literally called the single most important machine learning framework ""just dependencies""  (Yes I am using hyperbole)",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, this is what gets me about people thinking that AMD has some ulterior motive, or that this is the work of evil big AI, or that this will eventually be forced upon users.   Out of all the AI apps listed here (not the developer tools VSCode, Python and Pytorch), all of them are freeware. 3 out of 4 of them are open source. AMD does not develop any of these apps (Amuse was sponsored, but no one's going to use that with ComfyUI available). And with the exception of Amuse, all of these originally worked on Nvidia first.  AMD does not directly benefit from people having this software on their computer in any way. All of these are for running AI locally on your own hardware. You do not pay for any cloud compute or transfer any data to AMD. They make zero money by bundling these apps for you.  So why are they doing this? It's stupid, but the point of this is to let people know that these things now work hassle free on AMD cards. One of the many things they lagged behind Nvidia in other than upscaling, ray tracing and all that was local AI.   Getting something like ComfyUI working on Nvidia was as simple as downloading it and installing it. It just worked out of the box. By comparison, getting it working on AMD was a complete pain in the ass. [They even acknowledged as such](https://youtu.be/UZHffzyyatY) in their promotional video for this.  All this was aimed to do was to let people know this is no longer the case. Was it a hamfisted, clumsy way of doing it? Totally. But this is very different from something like Microslop trying to shove in Copilot into everything.  It's opt-in, for fucks sake. My drivers automatically updated because I forgot to turn off auto update and none of these things were installed on my computer. Hell, I wouldn't have known this ""AI Bundle"" thing even existed until I saw it on reddit.",Negative
AMD,"Oh yeah. Llms are easy going, especially with Lmstudio, but Stable Diffusion is my endboss. Never got it working right.",Negative
AMD,Isn't self-hosted severely limited and kind of stuck as you will reasonably not even have half the amount of memory available compared to commercial models? Assuming that you have at best 32GB of VRAM compared to the Nvidia AI optimized cards with 80GB of VRAM. Or is there not that much different between the smaller and larger models?,Neutral
AMD,"Nah, ComfyUI already simplified the process themselves. You just select ROCm on their installer and they handle everything for you.",Neutral

AMD,"If i already have installed rocm with Zluda, do i need to install anything else to gain the performance they claim this has?",Neutral
AMD,So basically your average Redditor?,Neutral
AMD,So many people don't even do a simple google search before commenting.,Negative
AMD,You jest but having ROCm PyTorch finally available for Windows is big news for some,Positive
AMD,Actually yeah this update is solid for people new to local LLMs (I run ollama via Vulkan on my windows + 9060 XT 16GB rig).  I hope they tweaked the ollama install. Not all amd  cards (like mine) can use local ollama unless the environment variables tell it to use Vulkan instead of ROCm. Vanilla ollama performance like shit otherwise as it won't touch the GPU without the env vars  Edit - apparently the installer will skip ollama install if it's already installed. The ollama build that the installer installs is preconfigured to use rocm including the libraries needed. I'll have to configure some env vars manually to take advantage of it,Positive
AMD,"God yeah  Im in computer science and absolutely hate the trend of LLMs and how its feasting on resources.

I always forget to make a note of the last episode i watched, so this tiny script i learned how to make is very very helpful. I'll be using python some more, just have to think of ideas.  Its really simple and just the exact thing i needed. Basically it reads VLC for file names and updates a text file with the last opened episode, and then i have a little tray icon that reads the text file and when i hover over it with my mouse, it gives me a tooltip popup ""Last Opened: The Office S05E03"".

AMD,"I know Optiscaler can, but for like 99% of people it is either the built in solution or none. To make the FP8 version run in FP16 should be relatively easy for AMD and they should at least do that. If some people want more upscaling performance then they can use Optiscaler with the INT8. Of course it will be for the best if AMD actually uses the INT8 version and also keeps the model updated in parallel with the FP8. That means maintaining 2 different main models (which in each model there are optimisations for several upscaling targets) which I doubt they will do.",Neutral

Even before this AI Bundle, the Portable Install automatically set everything up for me. I downloaded it, ran the .bat, and was immediately able to start generating.  That's rough. I mean, if it's only been a week and you'd really appreciate the extra $150 bucks, you could probably still return it and buy a 9070 XT instead?  That said, you might want to keep your 5070 Ti, because there's still a few things on the local AI side that are still designed completely for Nvidia. Nunchaku quants don't work on AMD and the devs have stated they have no intention of getting it working for it, and one of the best S2T models out there right now, Nvidia's Canary, is unsurprisingly only able to run on Nvidia cards because it uses Nvidia's NeMo as one of its dependencies.",Neutral
AMD,"You don't need to install anything, the whole point of this is that it does it all for you.  What you might need to do is uninstall things. I switched over from ZLUDA to ROCm a little while back, and while it worked it was acting weird because I had an old version of ROCm (6.2.4 or something) installed along with a bunch of HIP SDKs from my ZLUDA installation. Uninstall those before you update and remove variables from PATH or things might be weird.   I can't remember everything I had to uninstall, but ask an AI like Gemini and it'll walk you through what needs to be done. That's what I did.",Neutral

AMD,"Almost because it’s a hack and not supported natively by AMD. still works better on many games on some cards. A lower FSR4 setting looks better than a higher FSR3 setting, and performs about similarly. That’s a big jump in visuals for not much performance hit. I’m going to run cyberpunk that way on my 7900XT since FSR4 is the next best thing compared to DLSS, and way better than FSR3. Even on Steam Deck there are some games that look and play better with FSR4 hacked in compared to FSR3.",Positive

I heard (and confirm it works) opening command prompt as admin, typing `winget update -all` fixes this (reboot required), and it is, then after few days driver timeouts started again, on same driver version. So what changed? Windows update have changed. Same day that timeouts started, WU installed update. Keep in mind i am on WINDOWS 10, which got opinion of being stable. I guess quality of W11 updates have spreaded into Windows 10 ESU updates.  What next? Well, increasing voltage of my UV have helped, but now i am left at just -15mv, when -40 was initially stable. Crashes (driver timeouts) started on non demanding titles, like Gates of Hell Ostfront, in totally random moments.   I'll see how the new driver will perform, but with Fedora on dual boot, i'm starting to thing about complete block of windows update at this point. What this system is becoming?

AMD,"TLDR: me too, don't know why, at least now I see I am not the only one  Edit: I also disabled MPO as one of my last changes, and that might have helped the most.  System: Intel i5 12400, 32GB ddr4 ram, 1000W psu, Asus TUF RX 9070. Nothing overclocked. Default Adrenaline settings. Main display: 1920x1080@240hz Second display: 2560x1440@60hz  I've had this issue since I first installed my rx 9070. It's been driving me crazy, being new to AMD after a long time made me think it was just me. I never had this happen before on my system, so when the only change was replacing my gtx 1060, it didn't make sense. Went through it all, replaced the PSU, clean windows installs, new and old driver reinstalls, stress testing my system(showed no issues), changing bios settings etc. Even reseated RAM and GPU, replugged cables, flipped bios on GPU. Sent multiple bug reports through adrenaline software with all data I could find.  I use Firefox and it wouldn't happen so often, but it was still frustrating when it did, so I swapped to Edge. Thought it was just a Firefox problem because it seemed like it wasn't going to timeout, until it did. Tried Chrome, happened on my first attempt. Back to Firefox now and after a recent update, v147, it looks to be stable. It could have been windows updates being helpful, though there was no description of this problem in the change logs. This occurred from driver 25.9.1 to 25.12.1. Haven't tried Chrome and Edge again since I don't use them normally, but I did it at the time to try and find a solution.  I opened a bug report on Firefox: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1996433](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1996433)  After all of this, I think it is not a browser specific issue, though at first I thought it was. But I do think that for whatever reason, hardware accelerated programmes displaying media as it is drawn in or interacted with, on a second display, have a chance to cause a driver timeout. What made this clear was when I simply scrolled in Discord one time and it timed out, as it is also hardware accelerated. At this point I still try to reproduce it because it's hard to believe it's fixed, but lately it seems to be better, for now...",Neutral

AMD,Dude I thought I was going crazy,Negative
AMD,"You know what? I've been having the same problem. Not with Chromium apps per-se, as I use Firefox, but I've had a hanging problem happening for the last few months which happens at pure random. Only when playing / scrubbing through video in Firefox or VLC. The hang usually happens very quickly after starting playback. I've also crashed it with Vegas Pro, which also uses the Media Engine.  But I can run video for hours, or game + play video for hours, and have absolutely no timeout. But if I lock and unlock my PC, I might get a hang 1/50 times. Or if I spend a half hour or so scrubbing through video, which is heavily stop and go. Eventually I'll crash it.  There is also a REALLY annoying VRAM memory leak I've been trying to track down. I caught Discord once using over 8GB of VRAM. It's another one of those random and intermittent things which shows up, but doesn't correspond with any GPU usage. Only uptime.  I can't crash the card with only games, or with any stress test though. Even tried OCCT with variable and fixed loads. No crash. No errors. Even tried both of the BIOSs, which were both stable for a good two years, with my card.  EDIT: Hopefully not just speaking too soon, but I remembered that my card has a problem with one of the DisplayPort outputs. If I connect just the right monitor to it, the port drives the monitor just fine, BUT... the GPU will become very unstable for whatever reason. Usually coincides with the HDMI display dropping out randomly. The other two DisplayPort ports work just fine! Might just be a board problem with the 7900XTX I have as I've heard of other reports of this happening on cards with Type C ports, with the Type C port in particular being broken.",Negative

AMD,"There's still the occasional issue... For instance, Hytale seems to crash on 9070 series cards on Linux without warning.  Though, the difference is, on Windows, you're SOL until the driver or the game fixes it.  In Linux, you can set an environment variable for the game (and only for the game) to load a different driver (zink) that loses a bit of performance but solves the issue, so... S'long as you're willing to crowdsource fixes, Linux just lets you fix it.  And then, yeah, come in and look at the problems people are having on windows and...

AMD,It's on any Chromium based browser if you have hardware acceleration enabled. If you are playing any media it has a chance to freeze and cause a timeout.,Neutral
AMD,"Possibly, however downgrading back to October 2025 driver version resolves the issue, so I am not convinced it's just Windows",Neutral
AMD,"Might be, but I only started getting them immediately after I switched from Nvidia to AMD last autumn.

AMD,"That was never the claim. Neither from AMD, nor from Reddit.  AMD always stated that they will continue updating the driver but RDNA1/2 are moved to maintenance mode, and that game support will continue.

AMD,"The fact that it's an AMD-sponsored title and it's broken is truly wild though.  I understand OP's plight. Rather than going down to 1440p and dealing with scaling issues when sitting at your desk, just roll back the drivers.

If i was Тrumр i'd enforce tech companies to do as much as they can, because global scaling and QoL depends on them. Earlier you do stuff, more becomes available exponentially sooner.

AMD,9960X is a threadripper already so they would be messing up their naming scheme: [https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/ryzen-threadripper/9000-series/amd-ryzen-threadripper-9960x.html](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/ryzen-threadripper/9000-series/amd-ryzen-threadripper-9960x.html)   Seems AMD does more cores = higher number (with multiple numbers being used for the same core count eg 5500/5600) so unless it's a 9955X3D or something it would break something within their naming scheme,Neutral

AMD,"So I know all of that... That's really basic stuff and the overwhelming majority of people on this specific subreddit are aware.      \-----  And there's nuance. It REALLY depends on the task.   You end up in a situation where there's a trade off between needing to go through the IF more for core to core communication vs needing to go all the way to system memory for memory pulls.   If you have a task where memory bandwidth and latency sensitivities are VERY high and the need for communication between threads is relatively low then the task would work better spread across two CCDs with tons of cache. One hypothetical would be background tasks (windows, etc.) on their own CCD and whatever minor spill over there is from a game also living there.  The ""burden"" that comes with CCD to CCD communication isn't THAT high.      One example that somewhat conveys this - R5 5500 vs R5 3600. The 3600, despite having 2 CCXes (read: requires that hop you mentioned when going past 3 cores worth of workload), the 3600 is generally faster since it has 2x the L3 cache - this is also in spite of the many improvements Zen 3 brings over Zen 2.",Neutral

AMD,"Of course outliners by definition don’t exist if you zoom in onto one specific thing, but as a general purpose central processing unit even in scientific calculation benchmarks the speed ups they ARE indeed outliners in the benchmark suite. Why anyone would use a diy pc built on a platform with extremely limited memory support for such simulation is beyond me and is unlikely to be what amd has in mind releasing such a product.

AMD,"There are constraints on having an extra 8 cores on the CPU such as cooling, voltages, additional strain on the infinity fabric, etc.   And the nature of AMDs chiplet design for Ryzen is that all chiplets are generally made equal, and games rarely use more than 8 cores.   The only way the 16 core would be faster is if AMD artificially slowed down the 9800. And they kind of do, by using better bins on the 9950, but not enough to matter.

It was popular cause for like $80 you had a cpu that could do some pretty decent gaming.  Knowing AMD as well, when they're trying to get rid of old silicon and make these products, they don't stay around long at all. It's a one and done, so that rarity will make them worth all the more down the line.  Say you get this now and upgrade 5 years later, you could prolly sell it still for $300+.",Positive

AMD,"Yeah that seems about right when comparing gaming benchmarks like time spy CPU scores  I think the fact that the 5000 to 7000 series being a am4 to AM5 jump highlights how big of an improvement the 9000 series is over the 7000 series  Even with the platform jump of am4 to AM5 and everything that comes with it (ddr5 ram, better mobos), the average score and highest score of the 5800x3d and the 7800x3d are closer than the average and highest of the 7800x3d and the 9800x3d, but the 9000 and 7000 are obviously both on AM5 so the 9800x3d isn't pulling that advantage with the jump from ddr4 to ddr5 as wind at its back",Positive
AMD,Which games are those? Because that might actually convince me to go for the 9800x3d.  I thought it was pretty close but I should have checked in more depth to verify. I thought it was only a few % quicker in certain games/Resolution? I should have informed myself better.,Neutral

AMD,Yeah. I went to AM5 and X3D for stable fps and better low % fps. It does boost quite a lot depending game if its heavy CPU. 9800 wasnt that big vs 7800. But 5800X3D to 7800X3D was quite noticeable,Positive
AMD,Amazon 🥹,Neutral
AMD,"9850/9800 = 100.51%  ######So 0.51% faster, in fact.",Neutral
AMD,Sorry for being an optimist and a conscientious consumer.,Neutral
AMD,The 9800x3d should be sold as a 9800x3d. Not as a 9850x3d. Inarguably.,Neutral
AMD,It's the same B2 stepping,Neutral
AMD,Yes but asus sells higher volumes than other mobo companies. They sell significantly more volumes than asrock. Trying to say a few examples of 9800x3d failing on asus boards are equal to the massive amount of asrock ones is silly. Like asrock makes up a bigger portion of failures than any other companies. Trying to compare the two to each other is stupid.,Negative

AMD,"""average retail price $400""  That's crazy how badly the ram market is fucked at the moment.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes in the ram apocalypse, X3D becomes even more important because you can get away with buying the most basic ram that you can find without losing any meaningful performance.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah, it's very simple - larger L3 cache means fewer calls to the system RAM. Fewer calls to the system RAM means less dependency on its speed.   It's not just 9850X3D thing, it's basically a given for any X3D CPU.",Neutral
AMD,store on mbord ram \~78 nano second access/retrieval     store on x3d cache on 9850x3d cpu \~7 nano seconds access/retrieval   with todays ram prices amd really got a extra win there,Neutral
AMD,"Same on my end. The only negative impact is on 0.1% lows on games that have sections where I'm actually CPU bound. In WQHD, that happens next to never.",Negative
AMD,"That's quite the marketing BS. But I'm sure you can cherry pick and find titles where it really is less than 1% or make yourself GPU bound.  But in reality even with X3D RAM speed can have a large impact on performance, even if less than with regular CPUs.",Negative
AMD,Sounds about right.  Never seen much from RAM outside of Geekbench.,Neutral
AMD,Isn't lower latency more significant than speed for 1% lows?,Neutral
AMD,"I found a ""deal"" on some Corsair 128GB DDR5 6400 off of Facebook Marketplace for $800 but the timings are horrendous (CL42-52-52-104) and I was worried I was handicapping my 9950X3D.  Worries were very unfounded.",Neutral
AMD,"Cheaper Chinese DDR5 when? I know they are a couple of process nodes behind, but with current prices they could still turn a major profit.",Neutral

Evil 4 with ray-tracing, B Gate 3, Helldivers 2, TLoU2 and many others and there's a significant improvement in 1% low fps, my 9800X3D is set at PBO +100 scalar x1 and per-core CO with harmonized core voltages, tested at 1080p high/ultra settings. Maybe the 9850X3D is different but now I kinda want to test 4800 vs 6000 on my CPU.",Neutral

AMD,"Waiting for the 10850X3D, hopefully my 6000 CL30 won't bottleneck those 12 fat Zen6 cores too much. Save me X3D!",Positive
AMD,"Fun fact - massive L3 cache is also why DDR3 is still a viable option with minimal performance impact vs DDR4 for X99 Xeon CPUs as well. That is quickly becoming a new meta in the budget space, especially with new X99 boards supporting TPM 2.0 chips.",Positive
AMD,"Lies.  I saw a ~2% difference in CS when cpu limited on my 7800x3d between 5600cl26 32/32/64/96 and 6000 cl28 36/36/72/108, so as the 9850x3d is supposed to reach much higher clocks that’s just not believeable.",Neutral
AMD,"Cherry-picked single-player games at 4K? Sure, I'll buy the \~1% number.  CPU heavy multiplayer games (WoW, Star Citizen, Escape from Tarkov etc.) at 4800C40 vs. 6000C28 tuned? Around 20% higher average framerate and \~20-40% higher 1% lows. Massively superior stutter-free experience, even with X3D chips.",Positive
AMD,make sense to me. ppl are no reason to use high tier ram with x3d .,Negative
AMD,"it makes sense because x3d offloads a lot of data fetching/querying to L3 cache from memory, which heavily reduced the stress on memory side.",Neutral
AMD,"I run my 6000 kit at 4800 because anything above it is not stable.   7950x3D, latest bios.   Maybe I'm just bad with computers or I lost hard on the silicon lottery. Idk",Negative
AMD,I gave up on ram oc anyway. Most of the time xmp/expo made the system unstable in the long term.,Negative
AMD,"I'd believe this. Benchmarking my only DDR5 CPU, the i5 13400f (yes not AMD sadly, but anyway) I managed to overclock Samsung 4800mhz DDR5 stable (+custom RAM heatsinks) up to 5400mhz with tight timings. Was benchmarking faster/better than my Corsair Vengeance XMP 6000 RAM!!   Even made the Top 10 in CPUz  for multiple placings in the world for months, but have since lost that #10 title.",Negative
AMD,"so, is anyone gonna read the missing fineprint of what gpu is used? that difference is only believeable if they're running in a **gpu bottleneck**",Neutral
AMD,"If the expanded L2 Infinity Cache rumor is true, this will also lower RAM speed requirements. L2 is an actual write-back working cache. Large victim caches are nice, but the sizes should be balanced between L2 and L3 to stop L1+L2 from relying too heavily on slower L3 (albeit still an order of magnitude faster than RAM). Sign me up for 4MB L2 + 16MB L3 per core, keeping a nice 1:4MB ratio between them. So, a 12-core would have 48MB L2 + 192MB L3 total. That's wild!  It'd be nice if we could use a physical CXL RAM storage cache that is something like NVRAM or MRAM because if RAM is slow, NVMe drives are still barely improving random reads/writes where we'd see the most performance improvement. Those high peak, deep queue throughput numbers kind of don't mean much. I thought DirectStorage would be better too. Instead it stutters like the rest of Windows features. Gah!",Neutral
AMD,"Between DDR5 4800 and 5200 on x3d at 1080p, how much difference am I suppose to see? Because on 7950x3d and RTX 5080, I didn't see any difference in my gaming benchmarks.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah this is just false. Absolutely disingenuous.  What sort of FPS are we talking here? Average FPS or .1% lows? How is 6000mhz configured, is it in sync with the memory controller or is it in 2:1 mode? What resolution and in game settings are the games being run at?  Don't fall for this marketing BS, yes its true that x3D is good if you don't have fast ram, in fact it's great. But if you are running RAM that slow, it will impact your average FPS and especially your 1% and .1% lows which I would argue are more important for a consistent feeling gaming experience that your averages.  Man I hate marketing misinformation.",Negative
AMD,Idk about this one I get better performance to hit consistently above 480hz when I overclock my ram vs when its not overclocked it dips significantly.,Neutral
AMD,ITT people buying AMD marketing without any question when we have actual ram scaling benchmarks on 9800x3d,Neutral
AMD,good thing i'm running 4800 CL50 lol,Positive
AMD,Probably RAM manufacturer are a cartel and saw the RAM shortage miles ahead,Neutral
AMD,Nothing about timings.,Neutral
AMD,"Given these RAM prices, AMD should entice its customers by reducing its prices rather than continuing to charge top dollar for a CPU that is essentially mid-range (there are at least six other, faster consumer CPUs out there for various workloads).  Not gonna happen though.",Neutral
AMD,"Can confirm. Using DDR5-5600 ECC at 5400 (better timings yield better performance at this freq). In benchmarks, I am within noise relative to DDR5-6000 results.",Positive
AMD,"I have 32gb of ddr5 6000.  For the longest time I didn't know about expo and it was running at 4800 or something (CPU is a 7700x).  I enabled expo, and task manager is reporting it's now at 6000  I've not noticed any difference whatsoever either in gaming or development.  So I'm not sure it's just a x3d thing.",Neutral
AMD,"Right now its not worth it to spend on expensive ram but next gen they might improve the memory controller, and if they do and the ai bubble hasn't burst yet we'll be in a funny position.",Negative
AMD,anyway to know the difference with a 7950x3d on rendering?,Neutral
AMD,"I would very much not be surprised if that was the case. On my 7800X3D I get slightly better performance ( especially 1% lows ) using my CL30/6000 RAM kit at 4800 using Buildzoid's ""easy timings"" than by using the EXPO 6000 profile without the easy timings.  MT/S doesn't matter much in most games, what matters are the timings and latency.",Neutral
AMD,guess they never played Escape from Tarkov,Neutral
AMD,"Within 1% difference? There are a ton of (gaming) benchmarks stating otherwise. Also what is the CL latency when you make these comparisons AMD? The MT/s is only one aspect of the performance of RAM.  It has gotten to a point where you cannot take anything that AMD, Nvidia or Intel says anymore and just wait for people to do actual testing.",Negative
AMD,Latency is more important than Bandwidth for Zen,Neutral
AMD,its def more than that,Neutral
AMD,unless it's soc. Paying for RAM speed is not worth of it.,Negative

AMD,Time to use sodimm to dimm adapters.,Neutral
AMD,Rampocalypse,Neutral
AMD,might be important to mention that this is true for most games. does not apply to a lot of other memory bandwidth sensitive applications,Neutral
AMD,The only issue is that if the Hynix and Samsung stock go down peoplee get stuck with Microns which are total shit for anything. Even for plug-n-play they are lackluster.,Negative
AMD,"It's marketing bs though, yee X3D buffers better than lower cache CPUs, but the headline from this post is absolutely incorrect or taking cherry picked games because there absolutely is a bigger difference than just 1-2%, *especially* if you tube ram yourself.",Negative
AMD,Yeah but these ram calls are still needed. Avg fps might be not affected but large cache won’t help against 1% lows,Negative
AMD,"On your CPU(9900X), ram speed can make a big difference to performance",Neutral
AMD,Yes. After reaching 6000 you want to get CL (and the other timings and sub-timings) as low as possible while keeping your system stable. Disclaimer: you cannot RAM-timing your GPU-bound 1% lows away.,Neutral
AMD,It’s gonna be fine.,Positive
AMD,Higher timings still can be bad.,Negative
AMD,"Most likely eaten up for their own internal market, like local hyperscalers or big datacenters, plus Chinese consumer demand.",Neutral
AMD,"Imo even for China, it's gonna take time. They don't setup a single factory, they build a whole logistic chain to produce thing.",Negative
AMD,after they have used it for their own uses probably,Neutral
AMD,"You put so many details and numbers but described the most important part in just one ""significant"" word. Because from what I've seen in tests and my personal usage of various dram kits with 7800X3D, the avg difference is between 3 and 10%, which is not significant compared to their prices even before shortage. Some people now can save hundreds and lose their 5% FPS in 1% lows(in CPU bottleneck tests), and in reality it will still be GPU bottleneck in most games except for online FPS or cybersport.",Neutral
AMD,"If the application doesn't overflow cache and hit memory, or isn't notably punished for doing so, there is effectively no difference between speeds for the average fps. AMD is correct about this, games don't care much under that specific circumstance.  Whats particularly important is latency though. Most applications \*are\* punished for overflowing cache, which the 3d chips have a bit of an advantage about, and the latency hit is what kills the 1% or 0.1% lows.  AMD doesn't seem to say anything about the specs of each kit beyond the speed. Its possible both kits have relatively similar latency. A 4800 CL24 has nearly identical latency as a 6000 CL30.  Theres a techpowerup article somewhere about Zen5 memory scaling using a 9950X and even that shows less than 10% going from 6000 CL28 to 4800 CL40 so you could close that gap pretty easily with better timings.  (Alternatively just benchmark at a higher resolution, reducing the memory impact. Which they've again seemingly not specified but I'll assume 1080p.)",Neutral
AMD,> tested at 1080p high/ultra settings.   Thing is outside of esports most people are not buying $500 CPUs to play games at low res.,Neutral
AMD,crazy seeing ddr3 builds come back but hey if they are actually viable why not :D at least that's still affordable lol,Negative
AMD,Huge sample size you've got there.,Neutral
AMD,"Not wrong. I tested it myself for my 9800x3d. Good test is Shadow of tomb raider in-game benchmark (full game not demo as diff engine versions and they benchmark vastly diff). This game is extremely sensitive to ram oc when you put all lowest to make yourself 0% gpu bound.    I ran stock jdec speeds so 4800 vs tightly tuned 6000cl28 and the average fps was 20%+. This was at 1080p.   Of course as you increase resolution, and as the average fps is lower overall plus if a game isn’t cpu fully cpu bound, the fps gain difference decreases.   For 1440p or 4k single player games sure ram mostly irrelevant. Play any competitive games at high fps? It matters, a lot.",Neutral
AMD,"What's the CL rating for those sticks? You can probably easily run them at 6000 by reducing the timings a bit. If the sticks say 6000 you should easily be able to reach that speed with the default EXPO profile, iirc all Zen 4 chips are rated for 6000mhz at MCLK=UCLK. If you're not getting that there's gotta be something wrong",Neutral
AMD,"Paying for ram speed on Intel is absolutely worth it, just not worth on x3d chips as the big cache is doing the heavy lifting.  On intel there is a huge fps difference between 4800 and 6400.",Neutral
AMD,"Techspot found a 4.5% average/8% 1% lows difference between 6000MHz CL40 and 4800MHz CL40 on a 7950X3D. For CL30 it was 7% and 11%.   When 32GB of DDR5-6000-CL30 was only £35 more than 4800 RAM, it did make sense. Less than 3% of total build cost for 7% extra perf was a no brainer.    Doesn't make nearly as much sense now that there's a £100 price gap.",Neutral
AMD,In real life scenarios they can’t even tell the difference between a 4800 CL40 and 6000 CL30 but they will keep telling you 6000 CL30 is the only way to go and rest is garbage. Hivemind is really pathetic,Negative

AMD,"We have years of benchmarks with 5000X3D, 7000X3D, and 9000X3D, corroborating the claim that RAM performance, doesn't greatly affect overall performance in gaming, with an X3D CPU. Why are you insinuating we don't, and AMD's claim isn't something we can immediately verify?",Neutral
AMD,Most cards can do 8k resolution these days. That doesn't mean you'd really want to play a game at that resolution.,Negative
AMD,"We've seen what happens with 3dcache even on DDR4.  For X3D, the timing is what matters and makes most of the difference. Where we do see data transfer/bandwidth matter on system RAM for X3D is when you run out of VRAM by gigabytes.",Neutral
AMD,"To be fair, they can do 8k, just not fast",Neutral
AMD,I love how the PS5 boxes had 8K all over them while running the equivalent of an RX 6700,Positive
AMD,they can do 8k! even 3080 Ti can do 8k gaming on some particularly well-optimized games and dlss performance.  i play all my gaming at 32:9 2160p which is half the pixels of the 8k 16:9 standard. smooth as butter.,Positive
AMD,"I don’t see the problem. I CAN do 8K, just not to most peoples expectations. It outputs 8K if asked, it’s just low settings and low framerate hehe",Neutral

The workload needs to be memory bound to make a larger difference and with gaming it rarely is. The only way I managed to have it memory bound is with VRAM thrashing, but that's an unplayable experience to have my FPS tank to 28-30 while the textures are loading. ReBAR and EXPO helped, but this is something that's best to be avoided.",Neutral

AMD,I am interested in those 30+ games in AMD's first party benchmarks as well as the memory timings.,Neutral
AMD,"The thing to note here is that this is an X3D chip. The extra cache does a pretty good job at smoothing over RAM-related performance issues.  If this were a non-X3D chip, RAM speed would matter a lot more.",Positive
AMD,"It's much less important on X3D chips because the L3 cache stores stuff that would otherwise need loaded in and out of ram at much less of latency penalty.  It's why X3D cpus are so good for gaming, bc L3 cache is much faster than even the fastest system ram.  A regular 9700x would probably lose 10 percent of its performance using shitty basic jedec spec ddr5.",Positive
AMD,"It's paired with a 6700 XT. Strictly in gaming performance, their GPU is going to be the bottleneck by a very wide margin.",Neutral
AMD,"Nah, not really.    At absolute most in games at 1080p where you’re specifically cpu bound 5-7% at MOST.   In the 99% of cases where your gpu bound it’ll make ZERO difference the faster ram.",Neutral

AMD,"I lowered the clocks to 6000mhz for care free setup/stability (I didn't want to worry about instability running 1:1 at 6400mhz) and set it to the settings I saw in HWinfo for 6000, I think I'm running 39-48-48-96 now or something like that.  Probably losing 1-2% in games vs running my 32 gig cl32 kit but having the extra memory is worth it for me.",Neutral
AMD,Yep most likely this I'm pretty sure China has put a ban on importing foreign tech components wanting to focus more on local production and becoming self sufficient. Anything they produce now will likely be forced to stay in house,Neutral
AMD,"RAM timing is significant, even for X3D in esports. And by a considerable amount, in the 1% and 0.1% lows. Optimizing RAM is beneficial with or without X3D, unless you're blind. But yes, it's always better to have X3D for gaming.",Positive

AMD,"It is true specifically in 1ccx mode for zen5 x3d, but yes, the working set is large enough that it doesn't fit well in vcache. It still benefits enormously from it being there, it just needs RAM perf as well. Many cases where the hitrate is like 50-70% or something.  That's also true for e.g. large cities/raids in MMO's for example. If you bench standing alone in elywyn forest then even vcache does nothing because 32MB cache fits well, but if there are hundreds of players or intense combat around then 96MB vcache is overwhelmed and it spills out to RAM.  Since RAM is less than 1/10'th of the L3 speed, stuff really slows down when that happens (or if you have an OC, there is a lot of room to not slow down as much).",Neutral
AMD,"To expand on last comment, here's an example from FFXIV benchmarking with and without vcache on zen 5  https://files.catbox.moe/hfbf6c.png  If you selectively cut out the first scene, you can make the argument that vcache is virtually useless. However in another scene, the one with the worst performance, vcache is boosting performance by some 80%.  It's much the same with RAM OC, it just happens at larger data sizes (so less often). Even with the same game, systems, settings, all configuration identical it's critically important where and how you benchmark.  I'd generally recommend capturing the times of worst performance AND using a geomean of a variety of scenes for some perspectives.

Even as someone that does play Satisfactory now and then, I'm just going to stick with the lower voltage lower headache setup I have going since performance is still very good overall.

My limit is not the IMC, its daily voltages. 1.65v is my limit.  Less IMC stress is exactly right. Its called 2:1 for a reason. Running in 2:1 mode (Memory Controller Frequency, UCLK = Memory Clock/2, MCLK) on AMD AM5 (Ryzen 7000/9000 series) significantly reduces stress on the Integrated Memory Controller (IMC) compared to 1:1 mode.

It's disgusting and misleading marketing at your expense.  You can ask yourself: If the diff is 1% between some JEDEC memory speed well below what the 9800x3d supports, then why does AMD refuse to ever test it against their older CPU's or their competition without having unwarrantied and unguaranteed memory overclocks applied, even though it makes them look ridiculous?   They do it because it does matter - even with a terrible automatic OC, and even with vcache.

It sounds like Intel has a competing product that, while certainly no match in terms of raw performance, supports a more modern feature set that, for better or for worse, seems to be the future of mobile PC gaming.",Neutral
AMD,"Aren’t strix halo laptops generally positioned as highend devices with price tags above $2000? Cmiiw, but the audience at that price point seems relatively limited. Most buyers tend to choose either a solid laptop around $1000 or spend more for a true top tier model. At around $2000, a laptop that doesn’t match the gaming performance of similarly priced gaming laptops can be difficult to justify, and it may feel overpriced for users who don’t specifically need a high performance thin and light system.",Neutral
AMD,"It's available in a lot of different products, unless you have sales numbers to prove otherwise, pretty hard to say what the adoption rate is.",Neutral
AMD,"Before people start making uninformed statements, this is indeed edited slide used to make fun of AMD's marketing department.

The marketing department is hitting rock bottom, with all these attempts at coolness and all-caps writing.  By Blizt_324 > You know what's funny? At least your edited image is more realistic when it comes to comparing hardware. You are pitting the 9070XT against the 5090, literally the best GPU of either company. AMD pits their own flagships against Intel's midrange models and pretends Intel's lineup doesn't have anything better.    With that out of the way, those comments are 100% correct. This ""call out"" is a waste of marketing resources and detached from the reality of the laptop market. Almost no one covered ""Gorgon Point/Gorgon Halo"" during CES. Even when AMD made a big splash with ""Strix Point/Strix Halo"" in mid-2024 there are almost no compelling laptops or products using those chips. Intel caught up with Lunar Lake, Apple continues to consistently put out high quality and good value Macbooks, and Nvidia still dominates mobile GPU.",Negative
AMD,Holy shit that chart is real? 😭😭😭,Negative
AMD,"The ""25W"" is kinda BS though. Most of Intel's current mobile chips that claim a 25-30W TDP actually have a maximum power draw of 115W. I'm definitely interested in Panther Lake but we need actual benchmarks that look at both performance and actual power draw to know how good it actually is.",Neutral

AMD,What isn't relevant are DIY sales,Neutral
AMD,This sub is a goldmine for PCMR circlejerk comments,Neutral
AMD,"> Idk if AMD will beat Panther Lake this time in that aspect, but we'll see the reviews.  Strix Point barely beat Arrow (and only in multi thread power scaling while idle draw, media decoding, and various ultrabook workloads it's a wash at best). Straight up lost to Lunar Lake in pretty much everything apart from multi core, which is easily the least important metric in a <30w class ultrabook.",Negative
AMD,"> but I don't need an integrated GPU   In regards to your post down the chain, that's a bit short sighted. A functional iGPU is nice to have.

AMD,Premium is the price segment. Meaning lots of $$$. Not a premium brand.,Neutral
AMD,"Oh, they know. They just can't do anything about it because the gap is too big. Plus, Apple is on a yearly cadence versus 15-18 months for Intel and 24+ for AMD, so the gap will only continue to increase.  Zen 5 and Arrow Lake are less efficient than even M2.",Negative

AMD,"Seems like AMD doesn’t really know either.   It seems like you only hear about it from AMD is when they say stuff like here, like ""we’re still on top, we still have the fastest APU"".   They only compare it to products that aren’t really in the same class either.  Apples M4 systems are typically much cheaper and systems with dedicated GPUs perform better.  For local AI they haven’t shown a proper usecase for either yet. Yes, larger models do run on it but they’re so slow that you wouldn’t really want to use them.  I hope, they’ll find something for it",Negative
AMD,"The fact they still produce graphics for so many RDNA 2, 3 and 3.5 laptops, handhelds and consoles is the only reason I still have hope that they officially support FSR4 on the older architecture. It just seems recklessly malfeasant to abandon the stack.",Negative
AMD,"The 388 one is fun, should've been in the lineup from the start but oh well. Full 8060S and 8 cores, so a single CCD. The release timing is unfortunate. It should've been the FSR4 flagship product, such a perfect fit, oh well. Some day AMD will release the same arch for both APUs and GPUs, instead of this stupid 1 gen delay every time.  Generally I'm the target demographic for it. A person with a single laptop who works on it during the day and plays lighter games in the evening. I lived like that for a long time with a 7945hx + 4070m, it's still my gaming machine.",Negative
AMD,what are the cost effective options with 128gb shared memory?,Neutral
AMD,Exactly. I never go why APUs need such huge GPUs. it will be a waste of silicon for most and for the ones that need it it's till not enough.,Negative
AMD,I have seen multiple videos of YouTubers who went to CES and had hands on with panther lake. They were allowed to do everything except benchmark the CPU. They were allowed to see the TDP.  I think ETA Prime mentioned 65W max on a laptop he was trying. I don't know what Panther Lake was that.   DigitalFoundry has a whole podcast on the chips too. They aren't running at 115W this time round.,Neutral
AMD,"The leaked Geekbench6 scores are around 15k for multicore, which is really-really good, it is basically HX370 equivalent with a much better GPU. Also will be really curious about power draw, youtubers so far are saying really good things about battery life, so we'll see.",Positive
AMD,"Yes, but only short term. And not on battery power which has been an emphasis with Panther lake. Strix halo will draw a sustained 120W+ all day",Neutral

AMD,"It is a matter of choice. Back when RDNA3 is released they refused to put RDNA3 on APU too. We see it on APU today, so it was not impossible back then. No, it is not a design flexiblity.

AMD,"Depends on the definition of cost effective, but an M4 Max Mac Studio with 128GB of RAM costs $3500. It is however, way faster than Max+ 395 while having lower power consumption, and Apple MLX is way better supported than AMD ROCm",Positive
AMD,Because they're building an all in one system so you can work and game on the same SoC. All while saving on PCIe routing. If you don't need the GPU part just get a 9xxx series CPU.,Neutral
AMD,"Agreed, it's shocking they stuck with RDNA3 for their APUs and iGPUs.  They must have assumed they wouldn't have any competition at that level, and could force anyone who wanted higher end graphics to buy discrete RDNA4 cards.  Miscalculation at this point.",Negative

Panther Lake isn't quite enough of a compelling upgrade over the Z1E--it's definitely a better chip, and it's an exciting prospect for people just entering the handheld PC space, but it's not quite enough to make me run out and upgrade from my Z1E handheld.  Once we get a mobile APU with the raster performance of Strix Halo but with a modern ML-driven feature set for under $1000 (in 2025 dollars) in a handheld, I'll be all over it.

AMD,"No one is talking about HBM memory.   Question is: what is it actually for? Yes, RAM capacity determines how big a model can be but with a 256bit memory interface it's very limited in performance. Even DDR4 based CPU systems come close to that with much higher performance.    A current Threadripper/Xeon W build easily beats it in both performance and memory bandwidth and memory capacity.   Apple offers 128GB too but with a much faster CPU, GPU and a 512bit memory interface at a much higher speed. Yes, it's more expensive but arguably better value.    The M3 Ultra comes with a 1024bit memory interface.   Both base DGX and M4 (Pro) use slightly faster LDDR5X with 8533MT/s RAM for their memory  The Jetson also exists too with faster memory but only 64GB of it.

The Strix Halo Tuf A14 will be a tough sell vs the cheaper variant with 5060.",Neutral
AMD,So many people are buying these max chips for AI. 395 + 128gb of ram is really popular.,Neutral
AMD,Poor choice to make fun of considering it was the first production generation bringing native x265 10 bit encode to the igpu.  Overnight changed how efficient my plex server ran. I ran a cheap as hell pentium g4560 for years  The little things matter if you know what they are and use them.  Edit: specified 10bit,Negative
AMD,It's identical silicon so nope nothing at all,Neutral
AMD,2020 - 2100 for Nvidia is all about AI and it still doesn’t mean we can’t talk about and criticise their sidelined focus on the Client,Neutral
AMD,"I'm purely trying to engage in constructive debate here with the following response.   The dGPU laptop that I have, and have physically seen in stores, are all rather thick and heavy, at least in comparison to most iGPU based laptops.  I guess my question was really more about the packaging logistics.  People tend to buy iGPU based laptops cos they want something thin and light. An iGPU laptop that draws as much power as a dGPU laptop, and requires just as much cooling and weight to go along with that cooling, but still performs below that of a dGPU laptop for games is likely the issue here.  If you want a thicker, hotter, heavier gaming laptop, then you're going to want a dGPU as the tradeoff for that packaging.  The AI Max+ 395 asks for the same tradeoffs, but with gaming performance about on par with a 4060.  If I were making a laptop with it, that would feel like a rather difficult sell to potential buyers, unless the costs can be brought down to less than $1000.",Neutral
AMD,"I wasn't aware.  I did a quick Google search and found this:  [https://gpdstore.net/product/gpd-win-5/](https://gpdstore.net/product/gpd-win-5/)  Maybe I'm out of touch, but \~$2350 for a hand-held sort of strikes me as being out of the budget range of most who would be interested in a hand-held gaming device.  I'd more imagined hand-helds to be more targetted around the $300-500 mark, but maybe my perception is out-dated?  $2350 seems to be more of a high-end laptop price as it is.",Neutral
AMD,What do you think is the reason why that's the case?,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, I should have qualified that Strix Halo is great at servicing mobile ""power-efficient"" high-performance PC gaming market. Strix Halo laptops are powered by 140-watt power adapters while some RTX 5070 mobile laptops use 180-watt power adapters, and some RTX 5070 Ti mobile laptops use 330-watt power adapters.

AMD,They’re on track for 32 billion revenue for 2025 full year and they still act like the failing company with not even 1/10 the revenue from a decade ago.,Negative
AMD,"I have the GMKTec Evo X2.  The Strix Halo is so much more than ""just AI"".  It's a productivity monster.  It's basically a 9950x that boosts to ~95% of desktop speed, the quad channel memory controller almost closes the performance gap entirely against a dual-channel desktop 9950x, and the iGPU runs pretty much any game I've thrown at it at native 1440p with maxed settings (excluding ray/path tracing).  The ""AI"" aspect of it is more of a marketing check-box.  Sure. It has a dedicated NPU as well that helps with AI TOPS, but even if we ignored that, it'd be a compelling laptop in its own right.  This is why so many people keep asking for it in a larger laptop format.  I.e. the market is there, the capabilities are there, why isn't it being offered in a 15 or 16"" chassis with a 1440p screen is what many people want to know.",Positive
AMD,Huh? A productivity monster? What's stopping people buying a laptop with a 16 core Ryzen and a discrete GPU?!,Neutral
AMD,"Nothing is stopping them doing so.  A Strix Halo laptop would ideally be positioned that it's offering the productivity of a top-end laptop CPU, the gaming performance of a mid-range laptop GPU, and be able to be more energy efficient and a bit thinner and lighter than a dGPU based laptop.  Maybe my personal preferences are biased by my desires. I travel internationally for work.  I'd love a high productivity low-medium profile 16"" laptop that weighs no more about 2.0kgs that can also game acceptably when on the move.  I bought a gaming laptop a while back, and I really dislike it's weight, heat, and poor battery life. I know I'm not alone in those desires either.  For mobile productivity with a moderate gaming capability it just feels like the Strix Halo is pretty much perfectly positioned for that, and yet it gets treated like it's little more than a beefy handheld unit. IMO, it's a great product saddled with a marketing team that doesn't know how to position and package it in a way that people have been calling for.",Neutral

AMD,"The same way testmem5 can expose RAM instability after 30 minutes but you might game for decades without a single RAM error. AVX2 stability test is also unrealistic, most users buy a 9800X3D for gaming and no game uses 16 threads at full usage and 130+ watts.

For cyberpunk it's still true though, I am definitely not getting the same perf on my 7500F as others eith 9800X3D",Neutral
AMD,"It is cope. A better CPU would improve 1% lows due to handling game logic faster so it won't risk stalling while the GPU is doing it's work.

There are many aspects of a GPU that can affect performance like core, vram, 3d engine, output refresher. But whenever one part is at 100%, GPU report will say it is 100%. You want proof? If it is really 100% and no more headroom, why is the power consumption still fluctuating not steady?

I really, really wanted a Strix Halo laptop, but the lack of SKUs, price and the inflexibility with RAM kind of make it unappealing to say the least, not to mention the power draw compared to Panther Lake is unwelcome. These laptops are gonna be probably the best x86 in mobile has eaten in a very long time.  On top of that, it's almost making the 5050 look like a stupid part in a laptop.

AMD,"The performance looks fantastic for high end $1k handhelds.    But the ""80% faster than AMD's 890M"" claim is absolute bullshit.  They tested against the HX370 with LPDDR5 5600.  That said, against an 890M that *hasn't* been crippled, it should still be 40-50% faster which is great.",Positive

AMD,Lunar lake is in sub 800$ laptops now and 12xe cpus are available for sale 1300$ despite the ram and cpu shortage.   The comparison is good even before likely price hikes for strix halo,Positive
AMD,"We’re talking mobile chipsets here, strix halo is what happens when you throw efficiency out the window, with Power (TDP) range, typically from 55W up to 120W. The ultra H 300 has default TDP of 25W, with Maximum Turbo Power (MTP) going up to 65W-80W. Intel has a better design, if they threw 40 XeSS3 cores on it, it would prolly run circles around Strix.",Neutral

AMD,Keep in mind that each Xe3 core is about as wide as an AMD WGP. We're looking at 1536 vs 2560 shaders. The B390 is 60% as wide as the 8060S. 20 Xe3 cores would match the 8060S in width. 40x Xe3 is as wide as the 7900GRE.,Neutral
AMD,"Bingo  Strix is also limited by being RDNA 3.5 and no FSR4, so it's rather dependent on raw throughput, and it can't possibly fit in a comfortable handheld that would last for more than an hour and a half under load.  I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage. I hope they keep it up, it would really be cool to see an AMD vs Intel APU console war generation.",Neutral
AMD,It's about 50% bigger die with 1 CCD (which seems comparable CPU performance),Neutral
AMD,"This is a big of exaggeration, as you can see with Nvidia moving to gddr7. While bandwidth has increased substantially, performance is clearly limited by lack of compute power",Negative
AMD,">GPU's will take all the bandwidth you can feed them.   Didn't deny that. But 12 Xe cores is presumably considered the sweet spot, that's all I'm saying. And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.  Besides, Intel already has Nova Lake AX in the backlog, or whatever it's going to be called. Practically intel's strix halo. It'll have Xe3P cores, more powerful than Xe3, thus deemed more worthy of the halo treatment.",Neutral
AMD,"No official confirmation yet, but JayKihn leaked the tile size for the 12Xe SKU last year. Another user somewhere else said the 4Xe GPU is 33mm2.   https://x.com/jaykihn0/status/1812898063502938260   And even without the PHYs and NPU, from what I see, Halo's GPU tile is still like almost 3 times as big.

It's only 2x the fps (and who knows, panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus, but we'll never know, because Intel won't release a strix halo competitor)",Neutral
AMD,"Halo's die is still quite a bit bigger, but from the Intel side, you need to include IO, GPU and about half of the compute die which has the MCs, encoders / decoders, etc. to match the ""GPU"" die of Halo, so it is more like 200mm² to 300mm² when compared",Neutral

AMD,">much larger Xe3 GPU's exist.  The biggest one for the moment is on Panther Lake X CPUs.

But all I need to know is it's faaar bigger.  >panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus  That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.",Neutral
AMD,"Well Panther uses mixed processes, and hybrid tiles are bound to be a bit less space efficient than putting everything on a single die. And to be fair, Halo GPU uses N4P process while Panther GPU uses N3E So, still not directly comparable.   Gotta say though, Arc's PPA has improved a lot since Alchemist and Battlemage.",Neutral
AMD,"> That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.  Yeah, it doesn't matter how much memory bandwidth you have if the GPU doesn't have the raster performance to keep up with the flow of data. Case and point, AMD's R9 Fury X. Released with 4096bit bus HBM. Had a total memory bandwidth of 512GB/s. Yet the GTX 980 Ti released with a 384bit bus and 336GB/s memory bandwidth and it out performed the Fury X in pretty much everything.

Intel is comparing a 4050 with low wattage (60W system TDP IIRC) so it's not as good as the full powered 4050 which scores around 8000 on Time Spy. On low powered 4050s though like the one in the XPS and other thin and lights it will compare pretty evenly.

Exception is the Ultra 9 where they just do it with vPro support as standard.  These have a higher cost because you are getting more features.  You could make it so you just have one CPU and then the manufacturer pays a license for corporate firmware per device, but that's more work to then ensure manufacturers are licensing machines correctly, and more confusing for end-users where now if you're buying a corporate device with vPro support you know you are looking at Core Ultra 236V and 268V for vPro support whilst 226V and 258V don't have it.",Neutral

As of right now only the ending 8 differentiates the 338H from the small-GPU SKUs, which IMO is not clear enough.

AMD,">We need to stop looking at the Core Ultra 9 285K through the lens of a typical generational refresh  That's all what consumers care about. They don't care if ARL on paper or on theory is some great reset. Perf, power, and cost is what's important.   >he 285K is suffering from the acute growing pains of decoupling the compute complex from the uncore in a way that creates a distinct latency penalty that enthusiasts are mistaking for regression.  It's not being ""mistaken"" for a regression, it quite literally is one.   The problem is also that AMD also has disaggregated their compute from their IMC, and yet has *better* latency on *less advanced* packaging.   >The controversy here isn't that Intel failed to push frequency; it is that they deliberately chose to execute a hard pivot away from the monolithic brute force strategy of Raptor Lake to a disaggregated chiplet design that prioritizes area efficiency and performance-per-watt over raw, latency-sensitive throughput.  Nothing about ARL's current design prioritizes ppw or area efficiency over RPL's design from a chiplets vs monolithic perspective. ARL isn't enabling higher core counts from going chiplets, that seems to be left to NVL according to rumors. And chiplets carries an area penalty over monolithic designs anyway.   >The removal of Hyper-Threading from the Lion Cove P-cores is the most contentious yet logically sound decision engineers could have made given the thermal constraints of modern silicon.   This makes no sense   >By removing the simultaneous multithreading logic, specifically the duplication of architectural state and the complexity required in the reorder buffers and schedulers to handle two threads, Intel was able to physically widen the core and increase the L2 cache per core to 3MB without blowing up the die size  SMT costs Zen 5 less than 5% in area btw. Just throwing that out there.   >The result is a P-core with significantly higher IPC than Raptor Cove  It's not though. This has been a significantly worse ""tock"" in terms of IPC uplift compared to something like SNC or GLC.   >but this raw single-threaded throughput is being masked by the interconnect latency.  Maybe gaming or some benchmarks are, but for the large part, no.   You can see this two ways, LNC's structural gains (core width, ROB capacity, etc etc) have smaller gains, percentage wise, over their predecessor versus something you would see in GLC vs SNC, or SNC vs SKL.  And also LNL's uncore is dramatically improved over ARL, and yet you see the same unimpressive IPC gains over MTL/RWC (which is the basis for ARL's mid mem fabric).   >the architectural overhead of the Foveros packaging means that ring bus latency is higher.

AMD,"AMD had a very similar experience with their first generation of Ryzen CPUs. One of the differences here is Intel had a competitive product prior to their architectural shakeup. Had Intel totally croaked for years and not been competitive in the CPU space the narrative would be completely different and everyone would be singing their praises.  Aside from that I think the biggest problem with this new architecture is simply there's little reason to buy in. It was only recently (if memory serves, I could be wrong on this) announced that the next generation of CPUs will share this platform and later ones will be on a new socket. When AM4 was announced we knew that it would persist for multiple generations and now with AM5 - why would you buy a board that will be obsolete when its time to upgrade when you could buy into a platform that will support your next 1-2 CPUs? Especially with the old intel socket performing just as well on a more mature platform, for most end users this first core ultra series just isn't worth investing.",Neutral

AMD,"IMO corrupt tech sites and tech YouTubers are behind ARL’s failure for two reasons.   The first: AMD MCM processors without 3D cache are bad for gaming, and it’s hard to find this information in 90% of charts to warn intel about the consequences of going down this path, even though they should have done their own tests and experiments.   The second: in my own tests, the 265K was 15% faster than the 9700X on launch BIOS. Through BIOS updates, that gap extended to 20%, making it only 7%-10% slower than the 14700K. Yet on some very questionable charts, the 265K is shown as slower than the 9700X.   For experienced users, RPL CPUs’ temperatures can be lowered by 20°C by turning Hyper-Threading off and undervolting. For inexperienced users, ARL is better, as it runs 20°C cooler out of the box.   I believe that in 2026 we deserve raw, unedited video benchmarks that start from the desktop, show full system specs, then enter game-by-game benchmarking—no more charts with zero evidence to back them up.   When I tried to confront HUB with my benchmarks, I got blocked to cover up their lies and corruption. If they truly cared about which CPU is faster, they would share their in-game benchmark scores and discuss them in a scientific way, but that’s not their goal. The numbers go up and down for the highest bidders.   Lastly, I believe Nova Lake, with its expected 144 MB cache, will be faster than Zen 6 X3D by 10–20% as 9700x in real world is 20% slower than 265k and if both got the same IPC uplift NL will end up on top.

AMD,"285K seems to have fantastic workstation performance, I didn't think much before selecting Intel over AMD parts for work to be honest, considering the efficiency gains. We landed on 265K, it benches very favorably compared to AM5 parts in nearly every workload except for gaming, and even then, that's mostly the X3D parts, and even then, that's when there is virtually no GPU bottleneck.   Most initial ""gaming"" reviews were done exclusively with 5090s, which is extremely unrealistic for most gamers and gave an extremely false impression that you would see a massive uplift by buying this part compared with the alternative CPU parts in gaming.   A lot of reviewers such as HUB have done a lot of work to correct this impression with a variety of testing scenarios and explaining their reasoning behind removing the GPU limiting factor as much as possible in benchmarks. Incidentally, these reviews typically showed that anything less than a 5080 sees virtually no benefit with a 9800X3D versus, say, a 9700X, and incidentally the two parts that saw no discernible benefits were the Radeon 9070XT and the 9070.  Obviously, if you have a 5090 and an unlimited budget with price being no factor, your best bet for top tier performance in all categories is a 9950X3D, but that just isn't what most people are looking at.  I myself bought into the future proofing mentality with my CPU and bought a 9800X3D, and ironically bought another AMD Radeon 9070XT to pair it with, a GPU that seems literally no performance gain compared to a 9700X, let alone a 285K. The same 285K that takes a dump all over the 9800X3D in nearly every other productivity benchmark.  I guess the good news is that when I upgrade my GPU in 2-4 years, at least I'll take advantage of the 9800X3D in games, lol. But considering it cost me over $900 for CPU, RAM, and motherboard, that's cold comfort.

Intel could have looked at it and considered the latency worth the cost to improve in other areas and serve as intels seminal desktop entry utilizing disaggregated silicon. Then gamers came and lost their shit that the newest Intel chip deprioritized something that impacted their precious fps- even though the impact was ""the new one is approximately the same to maybe a little worse as last gen in most games"".   Notwithstanding the fact that the 200 series chips retain healthy gen-to-gen perf uplift and a _massive efficiency improvement_ in productivity and general computing, and boosting the NGU and D2D clocks (which are _very_ low from the factory, and can be done with the app that Intel _has specifically designed for tuning their chips_ and is freely available (XTU)) brings the gaming performance to ""approximately the same to a little better in most games"". Contrary to what some people may think these chips are not solely or even majority used for gaming and there are other use cases Intel can to think about/chose to prioritize.   To be fair, gamers and tech enthusiasts are the ones who will care the most and therefore have a disproportionately large impact on the kind of publicity the chip will get. So, was this intels smartest PR decision? Maybe not. But I think it was still a sound engineering decision, regardless of whether or not they had feedback or data on the issue, even if it didn't go over very well with their loudest customer base.  And this is all overshadowed by the fact that if you stuck even the most hardcore of gamers on a blind trial and told them to identify what kind of chip they were gaming on, I have a hard time believing any of them would be able to tell with any certainty which is which.   Once you get to 60 fps, the vast majority of people stop caring. Whats five fps going to do to radically change your gaming experience so much that it's unplayable? Which brings me back to one of my original points: If you care _that much_, you can go spend your money _elsewhere_.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm aware of CHIPS.  Like I said, I want Intel to be competitive. I hope if their new layouts mature into something that can retake marketshare that the same care will be taken to preserve AMD. AFAIK, no one came to lend them money or sign large multifaceted partnerships at that time. This ""must save Intel,"" movement is something that is borne out of how big Intel is. They're too big to fail, it would have too many implications for the economy.

AMD,"Let me explain why it will not degrade my CPU.  1. **TVB (Thermal Velocity Boost) is disabled when I set the turbo limit.** 2. **Current is not the issue.** First, even Intel chips were failing at idle. Second, you stated that ""the same power limit at lower voltage necessarily means more current."" That is incorrect, if it drew more current, then why does lowering voltage reduce power consumption? Have you missed basic physics? 3. **CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve.** The main issue was that either the CPU or the motherboard was supplying excessive voltage, or the CPU was requesting too much. Higher voltage is required for extreme single-core boosts, such as 5.9 GHz. This is why i3 and i5 CPUs were not affected. When I limit my boost and apply an undervolt, the CPU no longer requests high voltage. It might request slightly higher voltage for 5.5 GHz, but that is nowhere near the voltage required for a 5.9 GHz boost. 4. **The same principle applies.**  Its seems you are a failure of high life form.   Maybe read here more. it was already to high voltage   [https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop-Instability-Root-Cause/post/1633239](https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop-Instability-Root-Cause/post/1633239)  Maybe you havent read much. if you undervolted only using AC/DC loadline and didnt limit max frequency.

Also, ARL runs at lower clock speeds than RPL, so in some cases newer process nodes actually clock lower.   this happened many times before like 32nm SNB OC better than 22nm IVB and haswell or even 14nm 6000 series skylake, so no in most cases new process nodes don't improve clock speeds or at least not on desktop.",Negative
AMD,"Okay, so we've gone right off the rails of a logical discussion. I fail to see how we went from talking about a failing architecture, which I don't think of Intel's product line as, to the whole bailout discussion. Maybe because I said AMD didn't get bailed out? I think maybe you forget that AMD had to offload global foundries, I don't think anyone even blinked when that happened and it's likely because that was a different era.   My post had nothing to do with the bailout versus architecture (or saving it) , apart from mentioning that I don't believe as a consumer I should feel motivated to buy Intel over AMD, or any other American firm, at the moment.   To be very clear, as this is personal for you, I do own Intel equipment including an Arc graphics setup for one of my children. I'm not anti-Intel or anti-American at all.   I know the history between AMD and Intel fairly well. Oversimplifying, AMD as it is doesn't exist without Intel. AMD only grew because they were the most successful second source producer for Intel, and the most successful at riding the thin grey line between patient infringement and unique implementation of similar IP that kept them alive while everyone else in the X86 space either died or became irrelevant to the consumer or enterprise space. After Itanium, the story levels out with both companies becoming effectively unwilling AMD64 codependents, and I'm saying that humorously.   Intel would gladly own the X86 market outright. So would AMD. At the end of the day, we need the two driving innovation through competition. Even if the CHIPS Act, the government stock acquisition, and the nVidia partnership are solely aimed at bringing more, needed, chip manufacturing to the US, it could create a situation where that amount of leverage puts Intel into a hyper dominant position again in the near future.

Broadwell-E and early Skylake also weren’t great for OC.   -Once the node matured, things improved again. Coffee Lake (refined 14nm) made 5 GHz relatively easy. The same pattern repeats with 10nm: Alder Lake (12th gen) came after Tiger Lake and could already reach ~5 GHz, while Raptor Lake pushed clocks even higher, up to ~5.7 GHz.

AMD,"I mean no offense, but Passmark is irrelevant.  Even comparing the 890m to the 7600m (non-xt), the 7600m is usually twice as fast, with dips down to ~60% faster, and lifts up to ~170% faster.     NoteBookCheck has an extremely robust dataset of benchmarks in games for both the 890m and the 7600m (non-xt) at various resolutions, and they show not only a clear winner, but a very large difference in the performance of these devices.      Now I'm not trashing what the B390 will be, because we need an iGPU fight here.  But thinking that the 7600m (non-xt) is only ~15.7% faster than the B390 ((new-old)/old gives percent change) because of Passmark is erroneous.",Neutral

AMD,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works. It's like the 2001 Toyota of the laptop world, it's not winning prizes for looks, but it'll never die, gets good mileage (battery life), and is easily repairable. Maybe not the laptop you want, but definitely the one you need (excluding people who need something like a dedicated GPU or really need super high CPU performance).",Positive

AMD,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good.

AMD,"I sell PC hardware and get to test a wide range of components. I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance. I’ve shown full system specs and game settings every time, and provided more evidence than any tech site or tech YouTuber ever has, yet some people are still in denial.

AMD,"Arrow Lake performs quite well at general compute and power efficiency compared to prior generatons ans even against AMD.  Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU. Ironically the 9070 performance was identical with a 9700X and a 9800X3D.  So it's actually kind of the reverse, gaming reviewers painted Arrow Lake in the worst possible light.",Neutral

But they have probably picked examples that show them in a good light.   There is nothing wrong per se in the arrow lake lineup. In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all. The issue that destroyed the image of arrow lake is that the previous generation was often faster in gaming. That made every reviewer give it bad overall reviews.,Neutral

AMD,"As a real world example, I upgraded my primary system from a 14700k to a 265k recently. My other desktop is a ryzen 7900 (non x, 65 watt tdp)  Compiling my os takes 6 minutes on the 7900, 10 minutes on the 265k, 10 minutes on a 3950x, and 16 minutes on the 14700k.   That is not in windows, but my os which does not have thread director or custom scheduling for e cores. (So going to be worse than windows or Linux)   All the numbers except the 7900 are with the same ssd, psu, custom water loop.  The motherboard and cpu changed between Intel builds and the 3950x was the previous build before the 14700k.   The e core performance significantly improved in arrow lake.  It’s now keeping up with 16 core am4 parts in the worst possible scenario for it.  If the scheduler was smarter, I think it would be very close to the 7900.   In windows, it’s pretty close in games I play on frame rate to the old chip. A few are actually faster.",Neutral

AMD,"True, except AM5 supported all cpus 7000, 9000 and will support the newest one.

Well, you need a new board. So it depends what “cheaper” is seen as.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep. We all see the patterns here. Gamers nexus, HUB, LTT and most big name they all keep mocking Intel, even when Intel did good job to bring improvements to their products like fixing Arrow Lake gaming performance but those ""tech reviewer"" decided to be blind, they don't even want to revisit Intel chip and benchmark it, they don't even want to educate their viewers.    At the same time they keep overhyping Amd products to the moon like they own the stock, it's obvious now who is the real reviewer and who is fraud reviewer using their own popularity and big headline to spread their propaganda for their own benefits.

You can say that all you want but there's a reason why in the diy market everyone is buying amd over intel. People know arrow lake is doa where as am5 actually has a future, which is why everyone is flocking to the 9800x3d in droves.  Zen 7 is rumored to be on am5 as well.

Most tend to skimp, only to end up buying another middling CPU the following year, and then again after that. And so the cycle trundles on.  When I buy PC parts, I usually go for the best available. Provided the price is reasonably sane. I picked up a 9900K seven years ago and it’s still holding its own. Is it on par with the 9800X3D? Of course not. But it’s still a very capable bit of kit. Next time I upgrade, I’ll go top shelf again.",Neutral

AMD,"Hi all,  I ordered a contact frame from Thermal Grizzly because the temperature of my CPU wasn’t great, and I was tired of the fan noise.   I installed the contact frame in August, and everything was fine until two weeks ago, when the desktop suddenly stopped booting. The fans were spinning, but there was no POST, no debug LED — nothing. I thought the motherboard was dead.   However, when I removed the AIO head and tried to boot again, it worked!  Since then, I’ve been experiencing intermittent no-POST issues, especially after gaming sessions.   To get it to boot, I always have to adjust the screws on the AIO head. If it’s too tight: no POST. If it’s too loose: CPU temperatures are high. For example, in Hogwarts Legacy, I get around 60 FPS with an RTX 4090, while the CPU runs at around 18% usage @ 85°C. Which is not normal at all, as I used to run the game at around 100–110 FPS.  I tightened the screws on the contact frame using my thumb and index fingers.   I’m looking for advice from anyone who has encountered a similar issue, because at this point my only idea is to remove the contact frame and reinstall the original one.

AMD,"Intel ARC b580 apparently unable to run games in the snowdrop engine, but in such a way that it's almost impossible for benchmarkers/testers to catch.  I've been trying to run Avatar Frontiers of Pandora on my arc b580 for over a year now, and I keep having the same extremely unusual crash.  If I freshly reinstall the game, or change my operating system, or switch arc driver version, I can play the game normally, at regular framerates, with no issues, for around an hour. MAYBE two if I'm lucky.   The game then crashes, with seemingly no trigger. No thermal issues, no unusual resource usage, no memory leak, no framerate issues, no stuttering, not even a crash report. The game will just close as if I had closed it manually.   I don't crash in the same location every time, it crashes with different game settings, xess enabled/disabled, different monitors, different ram configurations. I can have the framerate capped or uncapped. GPU maxed out or not, power draw high or low. I can't consistently recreate the crash in the same way every time. The only certainty is that it WILL crash eventually.  After crashing once, It will then crash on game launch, every single time. The game opens, the epilepsy warning flashes up for a second or two, and then the game crashes in the same way, with no freeze, no crash report, just the game closing.  Since the game runs fine for an hour or so after I first install it, any benchmarker testing the gpu will likely never see the crash, because they install the game, run benchmarks, do their tests, and then close it before seeing anything wrong.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and have NOT worked.  * Updating graphics drivers (to both the latest absolute driver, and latest WHQL certified driver). * Downgrading graphics drivers (going all the way back to the first game ready drivers for the b580). * Updating windows (latest windows 10 and latest windows 11 versions). * Running a memory diagnostic * Enabling/disabling XMP. * Verifying integrity of game files. * Forcing the game to run in the Vulkan engine instead of snowdrop. * Performing a complete reinstall of the game. * Replacing one of the .dll files with a ""repaired"" one.

AMD,VR Support for ARC GPU? :),Neutral
AMD,"Hello, I'm experiencing an intermittent but severe system hard freezes on a prebuilt PowerSpec G441 desktop purchased from Micro Center 2 years ago. The freezes occur during gaming, mixed workloads (gaming + video playback), remote desktop usage (TeamViewer), and occasionally shortly after logging into Windows with no workload running.  When my PC hard freezes:  \- Mouse is unresponsive  \- Keyboard is unresponsive  \- No audio sound  \- No BSOD or error message     My PC does not recover and requires a manual power button reboot.  After a forced reboot, Windows loads normally and allows me to log in but the system may freeze again within 1–2 minutes, even at idle. Other times, the system may run normally for days before the issue reappears.  No relevant error logs are generated at the time of the freezes. Event Viewer only shows Kernel Power events related to the forced shutdown.  So far I've tried all possible solutions to resolve my issue:  \- Updated motherboard BIOS to the latest available version  \- Updated Windows 11 fully and also reinstalled Windows 11 through USB  \- Performed clean GPU driver reinstallations  \- Verified CPU and GPU temperatures (normal under load)  \- Ran hardware stress tests and diagnostics (CPU, GPU, memory, storage) and no failures detected  \- Tested each monitor individually (dual monitor setup)  \- Swapped HDMI/DisplayPort cables and ports  \- Tested my PC without background applications  \- Returned my PC to stock settings (no overclocks, no undervolts, no XMP changes beyond default)  I've also took my pc to a local repair shop, which they could not reproduce the issue but suggested it may be CPU or PSU related issue. However, when I took my PC to Micro Center, technicians ran similar diagnostics and stress tests but were also unable to reproduce the freezes. They have also tested the PSU voltages and it passed.

AMD,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Neutral

AMD,"u/hus1030  The mounting pressure from your AIO cooler can directly affect whether the system successfully completes POST. When the cooler is tightened too much, it can cause the CPU or motherboard to bend slightly, which may lead to poor or lost contact between the CPU and the socket pins. This prevents the processor from initializing properly, resulting in a no-POST condition. Installing a contact frame changes the pressure distribution compared to the stock retention mechanism, so overtightening the AIO screws can amplify this issue. On the other hand, if the screws are too loose, the CPU temperatures will rise because the cooler is not making proper thermal contact. To avoid these problems, ensure the AIO screws are tightened evenly in a cross pattern and do not exceed the manufacturer’s torque specifications. If the issue persists, you may need to verify that the contact frame is correctly installed or temporarily revert to the original retention bracket to rule out pressure-related problems.",Neutral

AMD,"u/Any_Information429 Your HP EliteBook 830 G8 is experiencing boot issues due to corrupted Intel Management Engine (ME) firmware, which is a critical low-level system component that manages hardware initialization. This corruption is causing the blinking caps lock light, multiple restart attempts before successful boot, and the extended Windows startup times you've been experiencing. The BIOS showing ""ME Firmware Mode: Recovery Mode"" confirms this diagnosis. Since these issues began after your recent repair, it's likely that the Management Engine chip connections were disturbed or the firmware became corrupted during the service process.  To resolve this, you need to perform a forced recovery of the ME firmware by downloading the specific firmware version for your EliteBook model from HP's support website-[HP EliteBook 830 G8 Notebook PC Software and Driver Downloads | HP® Support](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/hp-elitebook-830-g8-notebook-pc/38216726) and using specialized recovery tools to reflash the Management Engine. You also have check BIOS settings to ensure proper ME configuration and temporarily disable fast boot to allow complete initialization. If the firmware recovery doesn't resolve the issue, this may indicate hardware-level damage to the ME controller that occurred during the previous repair, which would require professional chip-level service or potentially warranty coverage since the problem originated after authorized service work. The good news is that once the ME firmware is properly restored, your system should return to normal boot times and eliminate the restart cycles you're currently experiencing.  USB flash recovery method is definitely worth trying first - it's designed specifically for these types of firmware corruption issues and should get your laptop back to normal boot times without all those frustrating restarts.

The real culprits are more likely things like memory issues, BIOS problems, or conflicts with virtualization features like Hyper-V.

AMD,"u/strumpystrudel So what you're experiencing is actually pretty normal behavior for your laptop when it's unplugged - that 80% performance drop is totally expected and here's why. When your laptop is plugged into the wall, your CPU can run at much higher power levels (probably around 28W or more), but when you switch to battery, it gets severely limited to maybe 8-15W to preserve battery life. This is especially true for ultrabooks like the Gram that prioritize being thin and light over raw performance. The thing is, a lot of this power management happens at the hardware level with Intel's built-in systems, which is why all those Windows power settings you tweaked aren't really making a difference - the CPU is basically ignoring them and doing its own thing to save battery.  Now, for a game like Final Fantasy XI, you should still be able to get it running decently on battery with some tweaks, but expecting that same smooth 60 FPS at max settings is probably unrealistic given the fundamental power constraints of ultrabook design. Most ultrabooks see this kind of 60-80% performance hit on battery for any sustained workload, so you're definitely not alone in this.   But honestly, this is just how these thin and light laptops are designed to work - they're amazing when plugged in, but they have to make compromises when running on battery to actually give you decent battery life.",Neutral

AMD,"u/Sk7Str1p3 I'm pleased to confirm that TME is indeed supported on your i7-12700F processor. TME is a security feature that encrypts the entire system memory using AES encryption with a hardware-generated key. The i7-12700F is part of Intel's 12th generation Alder Lake family, which includes TME support as a standard security feature.  However, TME functionality requires both processor support and proper system configuration:  Verification methods:  * BIOS/UEFI security settings * System diagnostic tools that enumerate processor security features  Important considerations: TME enablement depends on the motherboard BIOS implementation and may be disabled by default on many systems.  To assist you further, I need the following information:  * Make and model of your motherboard, as the TME feature may be disabled in the BIOS settings  For your reference, please find the official documentation: 12th Generation Intel® Core™ Processors Datasheet, Volume 1 of 2  [655258](https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/655258) (Page 40) - This document contains the specific technical details about TME support for your processor.  Once you provide your motherboard information, I can guide you on how to check and potentially enable TME in your system's BIOS settings.  Please let me know if you have any additional questions.",Neutral
AMD,My motherboard is Asrock H670-M Pro RS. firmware version: 18.01,Neutral
AMD,Hello. I want to tell you i7-12700f does NOT support TME. Thank you for your help anyway.,Negative
AMD,"Your Intel i7-12700F processor does support TME (Total Memory Encryption), but the issue lies with your motherboard implementation rather than CPU capability. The ASRock H670M Pro RS with firmware 18.01 appears to either disable TME at the platform level or doesn't expose the necessary BIOS controls for consumer users. This explains why your diagnostic tools show ""TME = false"" and why HWiNFO64 displays it in gray. While you could check for TME-related options in your BIOS under Advanced → CPU Configuration or Security sections, consumer-grade H670 motherboards often omit these enterprise security features from their interfaces. Your best course of action is to contact ASRock technical support directly, providing your exact motherboard model, BIOS version, and specifically asking about TME support and whether future firmware updates might include these controls.",Neutral
