Intel,Why does this need an article? It's a tweet by an official account praising their own product.,Negative
Intel,"The B580 has 200W TDP, in a perfect world and TDP scales linearly, the B770 would be 50% faster, that would put it around the 5060Ti/9060XT.  If the price also scales linearly, that would be around 375€, seeing that the 9060XT is going for 350€ now, it's gonna be tough competition.",Neutral
Intel,Im really looking forward to panther lake X. 4-4-4 core configuration and Xe3 iGPU with sr-iov is perfect for running a Linux-Windows mixed vm environment without having to get a gaming laptop with a dedicated GPU for virtualisation.,Positive
Intel,I hope the Linux driver support and performance is good in these,Positive
Intel,"Intel ARC needs to maintain their momentum. They have an excellent pricing strategy and genuinely compelling features, it's time they released a card that competes in the midrange. And no, I don't count the A770. As a B580 owner, increased ARC adoption rates will be sure to benefit all cards in the range, so I really hope that intel is committed for the long-haul here. They are not in the position to be burning consumers anymore",Positive

Intel,They wouldn’t need a B770 or mystery GPU if they actually released more than just a B50 to the masses.,Neutral
Intel,"I don't know what the driver situation is like a year later, but B580 was anywhere between a 4060ti and a 3060 (or less if the driver really choked), so comparing B770 to a single Nvidia point of reference probably isn't the whole story.  Intel has been selling a big chip with a lot of hardware relative to what they charge, so when the drivers work Battlemage can punch way above its price class. I expect the same this time.",Neutral

Intel,Trying to apply logic or rules to the internet is a waste of time.,Negative
Intel,"Scaling by TDP is not a good metric as they can pack more cores ect. and run them at lower, more efficient speeds. That however will mean a bigger die and viability might be questionable (considering they're already massive for the performance).",Negative
Intel,"Price doesn't scale linearly because die sizes make defects scale quadratically. so pricing is the same, 2 50mm\^2 dies are cheaper than 1 100mm\^2 die     However in GPUs there is a fixed cost for every GPU so there is a sweet spot",Neutral
Intel,"As always, TDP is a semi-arbitrary figure and has little to do with what the GPU requires.  Most GPU's of today have heavily inflated TDP's simply to try and juice benchmarks on review day as much as possible.",Neutral
Intel,"The BMG-G31 is supposed to have 32 Xe cores in 8 render slices on a 256-bit memory bus, compared to the 20 Xe cores and 5 render slices on a 192-bit memory bus for the BMG-G21. Unless Battlemage is seriously memory bandwidth-limited, it should be almost 50% more performant.  The only question is die size. If it's 50% larger than the 270 mm^2 BMG-G21, that would exceed 400 mm^2. The GB203 in the RTX 5080 is 378 mm^2 for context.",Neutral

Intel,Intel never confirmed SR-IOV on Panther Lake - did they?,Neutral
Intel,"You can choose between high performance and crashes (xe) or low performance and stable (i915), and with Intel firing linux devs left and right I wouldn't expect much improvement any time soon.",Negative
Intel,That would be an amazing value proposition.,Positive

Intel,I’d be happy if they didn’t gate the Arc Pro B60 behind bad distributors.,Negative
Intel,"So banking on the hope, that *everyone* ***else*** *somehow falls behind by accident*, only for Intel to succeed?  If that's their business-plan (looking at their foundry-woes, it seems it is), that's an awfully idiotic business-model.  ---- Last thing I heard, was redditors moaning about en masse that monopolies are bad. *Which one is it?!*",Negative
Intel,"The B50 is not a gaming GPU and actually underperforms in gaming tasks compared the the B580. They need to have an actual range of cards, not just a budget option, and even more budget option, and a server/workstation GPU. The B770 is essential to compete in the midrange",Neutral
Intel,"A year later the drivers are fantastic, seriously not even a single hiccup. Been playing Hogwarts legacy at 4k 60fps with Xess Quality upscaling, and no frame gen.",Negative
Intel,"> Scaling by TDP is not a good metric as they can pack more cores ect. and run them at lower, more efficient speeds.   The problem with this idea, is that this would cost them far more money, as you need more die space, which they already use relatively inefficiently compared to nVidia.  They can't really afford not to use every bit of die space they have for all that its worth.",Negative
Intel,"Battlemage doesn't have the ability to add more Xe cores per render slice, this is something Intel has changed for Xe3. The BMG-G31 will have 128 ROPs, the same as an RX 9070 XT, or more than an RTX 5080.",Neutral
Intel,"FWIW that is not how pricing structures work. It's a bit more complex than that.   E.g. defect rates scale with die size, that is true. But larger dies also have more budget for DFM structures, that can lead to fewer overall functional faults than smaller dies and more variability and binning opportunities. So although smaller dies tend to be on average cheaper, it is not necessarily that 2 dies half the size will be cheaper than the twice as large single die.",Neutral
Intel,"afaik it works on every iGPU since skylake, but the driver is not in the mainline kernel",Neutral
Intel,I'm using an Arc A770 right now in Linux.  With i915 performance was unusably (for me) low.  With xe it's been fine.,Neutral
Intel,"the driver is already open source right? i think it will get better over time on virtue of being open source, but relying on intel to fix it now probably isnt gonna pan out.",Neutral
Intel,"Well it kinda has to be, the 4070 came out nearly three years ago.",Neutral
Intel,5060 performance for twice the price isn't a good deal.,Neutral
Intel,"I could see that. Nvidia really bailed out Intel by making the 5070 not much faster than the 4070 without using MFG to cheat lol   Edit: for all the Nvidiots downvoting, [the truth hurts](https://www.techspot.com/review/2960-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070/#RT-1440p-png)",Neutral
Intel,This seems an absurd overreaction. All I'm saying is they don't do a 5060ti or 9060xt situation where there's a 8 gig model and a 16 gig model.,Negative
Intel,"It’s not but the B50 is the only Arc Pro that isn’t gated behind a bad vendor like Hydratech.    If they can’t properly launch the B60, why should I trust Intel or it’s partners with the B770 or some mystery GPU?",Negative
Intel,5060 is not nearly as performant as the 4070,Neutral

Intel,4 pcores  8ecores 4 lpcores..,Neutral
Intel,"Geekbench’s scaling has always been problematic, and the differences between architectures are huge. The benchmark is very friendly to ARM and least favorable to AMD. Even a random Apple M5 chip can easily score close to 20,000.  Therefore, cross-architecture comparisons using Geekbench scores have little real meaning. The only valid reference is **same-generation, same-architecture comparisons**, such as between the 285H and 388H.  Based on the actual results, the improvements are about **9% in single-core** and **21% in multi-core**. Given that the 285H scores around **22,500** in Cinebench, I estimate that the 388H should be able to reach roughly **24,000**.  But the key point is **power efficiency at lower power limits**. For example, if the 285H needs around **80W** to reach 22,500, then the real question is:  * How much power does the 388H need to reach 22,500? * How many watts does it take to exceed 20,000?  This is what really matters. If the 388H can achieve 2**0,000 at 35W**, **22,500 at 60W**, and **24,000 at 80W**, then that would represent massive progress. It would also strongly indicate that Intel’s 18A node indeed offers significantly better energy efficiency than TSMC's N3B.",Negative
Intel,"Is Intel just ""squeezing the toothpaste"" again ? Even a low-frequency single-core 288V gets 2,700+ on Geekbench, while the 285H gets 2,600+ in single-core and 14,785 on multi-core. Therefore, TL;DR: I don't see Panther Lake being a huge improvement over the current Alder/Arrow Lake pairing. We will have to wait and see the power consumption, though.",Neutral
Intel,"I’m sorry, but that’s awful? Only 9% better single core when it has a better node and a newer architecture? Compared to what Apple and Qualcomm achieve every year, that’s pathetic",Negative

Intel,"Panther Lake doesn't bring any major changes to the cores. It's mainly about bringing node shrink, redesigned SoC, and new iGPU.",Neutral
Intel,"It’s obvious that this is the viewpoint of an outsider. Professionals would never look at it this way. Professionals first evaluate a processor based on its specifications, features, and process technology. Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake are *not* using some outdated process — they use TSMC’s then-most-advanced N3B node, Intel’s first time adopting it. Meanwhile, Panther Lake uses Intel’s own **18A** process.  Based on the current benchmark results, Intel’s 18A appears to outperform TSMC’s N3B by at least the same margin that **Intel 4** trailed behind N3B — which is an astonishing result.  Every day you hear people saying how much TSMC has advanced, how far ahead its processes are, how “outdated” Intel’s nodes are, how AMD’s processors using TSMC have excellent efficiency. These kinds of statements have been repeated endlessly over the past decade.  Yet today, Intel is using its newest process node to **clearly surpass** TSMC’s top process from just one year ago.",Neutral
Intel,"the real test will be how many watts the X9 388H needs to achieve its scores, because the 285HX needed like 90 watts to achieve its scores  so if the X9 could hit its scores while on its base TDP (65 watts) then thats a \~40% increase in efficiency, not bad",Neutral
Intel,"But it does that while clocked almost 6% lower, so the IPC gain is actually decent. Especially considering most people expected Panther Lake to be a side grade because of the small architectural changes on the cores.",Positive
Intel,"For the use cases of PTL, Geekbench (which is mostly consumer focused) is a good indicator.  It doesn't assume that its workloads are perfectly parallel, it assumes some threads are used more heavily than others, so its value in nT is influenced by its 1T.    If someone is using this for rendering or other highly parallelizable workloads they might want to look into a subtest or into an alternative benchmark, but for typical consumers it seems like Geekbench is a good approximation of their experience.",Positive

One difference is that since geekbench is distributed as binary it’s compiled more directly for apple architectures specifically while others use more generic targets. But that has very limited effect.",Neutral
Intel,But they have a gpu compute test too,Neutral
Intel,"Geekbench claims it's much more realistic than those multicore tests that scale nearly perfectly with tons of cores, and I think that's a fair take. It's not as if they didn't know how to create a benchmark that scales like other nT tests do, geekbench 5 nT does that.   I wouldn't call it worse, just different.",Positive
Intel,Geekbench runs common workloads as they are commonly implemented. It gives you a score on how well a multi core implementation of that workload would actually run in that CPU.   I think that is far more useful than some perfectly parallel workload measuring max power and core count.,Positive
Intel,"I have carefully compared the various models across Geekbench, PassMark, and the differences between Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake. If my judgment is correct, the theoretical peak performance of the 484 in Cinebench R23 should reach around **24,500**; the 285H scores **22,500**. Compared with the 285H, it should be easier for the 484 to achieve high scores because its power requirements are significantly lower than the previous generation built on TSMC N3B.  Its peak performance will not be extremely strong because the frequency is not high. IPC is likely improved by around **10–11%**, but clock speeds drop by about **6%**. Overall, that means single-core performance should only rise by **4–5%**.  The improvement will be most noticeable in Geekbench. Since PassMark single-core also shows gains, the IPC uplift and resulting single-core increase should be quite certain. If Geekbench were the only source, it would still be questionable, but PassMark is more solid and has higher reference value.  Overall, in terms of peak performance, the uplift is average—around **10%**, close to that figure.  However, the real key is the **efficiency gains**. I believe they will be excellent. Compared with the 285H, which requires **65 W** to reach **20,000** points in Cinebench R23, I estimate that the **388H** may only need **40–45 W**.  I also estimate that the Cinebench R24 score should fall around **1300–1400**. Compared with Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 at **1950**, there is still a significant gap—but the two products differ drastically in scale.  Overall, Panther Lake’s greatest achievements lie in several aspects:  1. **Energy efficiency** — likely the best among all x86 products. 2. **Performance per mm²** — excellent. For example, the 484: if you look at its die shot, the total area of the CPU (including the CPU tile’s 4P and 4 LPE cores and all caches) is essentially equal to the die area of a traditional monolithic 8-core design. That means the 484 uses the same silicon resources as past 8-core chips, yet **no AMD mobile 8-core processor surpasses it**, either in raw performance or efficiency. 3. It also offers better performance-per-area than Qualcomm’s processors. The X Elite 2 has **18 cores**, including **12 “very large” cores**—similar in size to Intel P-cores—and **6 large cores**, each larger than Intel’s E-cores. The die area of this chip is **2.5× larger** than Panther Lake 484’s.",Neutral
Intel,"I mean, it does bring SOME changes to the cores, both are a next generation, it just isn't a more radical change like will be happening with NVL.  A mid single digit improvement is still pretty decent.",Positive
Intel,">The benchmark is very friendly to ARM and least favorable to AMD.   How so?   >The only valid reference is **same-generation, same-architecture comparisons**,  Geekbench is nice because it explicitly allows cross ISA comparisons.

Intel,I have workloads that scale fine with 16 threads and would scale fine with 32. People who actually buy high end multicore CPUs have a use for them.,Positive
Intel,It runs for far too short a time to reflect accurate multi-core performance.  People don't get a multitude of cores to run a task for a few seconds.

Because that is the only useful measure of ""inflation"". Everything else is just corporate profits   If prices for everything go up but wages don't then that leaves less money for frivolous shit like ram and storage and laptops and consoles, not more.  Even in my country where our wages are automatically indexed to match inflation, our purchasing power has dropped because the actual cost of living isn't properly represented in whichever calculation is used for the inflation number.  Houses have gone up by 100+ percent since 2015, rents have gone up by over 60 percent, grocery prices have more than doubled, utility prices have risen sharply, public transport has more than tripled in cost.

Intel,B580 user here. I coupled it with a R5 5500 and as of the recent updates the card just seemed to run much better vs when I got it last July.

When it refreshes the tree it asks connected devices if they are online, including the HDDs. Now move the window back and forth between your screens. When the explorer moves into HDR screen, it gets redrawn. Same when it moves to SDR screen. I suspect but cannot confirm there is a bug where the old instance is not cleaned correctly.

Second is the memory itself, they need something with higher bandwidth (but that might be addressed with LPDDR6).  To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.  Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.

Intel,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.  EDIT: 8060S (Strix Halo) is \~18,000 for reference.  EDIT 2: 890M (strix point's top end) about 8,100, so the PTL 12Xe chip will smoke that.

The power-draw of these SKUs is supposed to be a TDP of *officially* 25W – In reality, these parts are allowed to draw as much as 55W (2+0+4 or 4+0+4) and 65/80W (4+4+4 and 4+8+4) respectively.  So it must be seen, if these parts are any more efficient in daily usage, or just a side-grade to Lunar Lake.",Negative
Intel,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power. A 10-15% frequency advantage would go a long, long way towards closing gaps if it comes as a relatively small power cost.",Neutral

Intel,It makes sense to have three as the low-power cores prioritize keeping the power consumption low for battery life but to achieve this they aren't attached to the ring bus which hurts performance so 8 regular E cores are also used,Neutral
Intel,">I can't say I'm entirely sold on the idea of having three core clusters humming inside my laptop.  From a user's perspective, CPU's are a blackbox and the inner-working details are irrelevant. What matters is results. They want, typically, a balance of performance, battery life, heat / fan noise, and cost, placing greater emphasis on one of these categories over the others.  The idea is that P cores = performance optizied  E cores = Area optimized  LP-E Cores = power optimized.  The theory being to have different core types focus on different parts of PPA.  E cores and LP-E cores are the same microarchitecture. Just LP-E cores are off-ring so the ring (and rest of the cores) can be powered down in light-load scenarios.  Intel's biggest problem is that looking at each of the cores, the P cores perform their designated role the worst. 200% larger than E cores for \~10% more IPC and \~15% more clockspeed is a pretty rough trade off - and by the time you've loaded all P cores and need to load E cores too, that clockspeed difference diminishes hard.

With fewer thermal constraints and much higher power budgets, they should be able to push well past the perf/W peak, where it should continue to scale well and for a long time before it starts hitting severely diminishing returns.  I'm not talking 300W monster CPUs, but the scaling between a 65W and 105W 18A CPU should be more significant than on current nodes, where you might gain like 10-15% additional performance from that 50% power bump.

That makes me optimistic about the improvement opportunity in a more mature 18A if they can chase down these issues, and perhaps even more in 18AP if they can clean up these bugs.  If they have a 'double upgrade' opportunity in both fixing the discovered 18A issues and implementing the originally planned 18AP improvements then it could end up being a somewhat bigger jump.  Don't think it'll be an N2 beater though.  18AP *might* beat the best of N3 in some applications, we'll see.  For that you'd want to look ahead to 14A where the CFO mentioned on the earnings call (and he was somewhat realistic in other areas so it's more believable here) that 14A has been a positive surprise and they're actually pretty excited about it.

It's what they did with 10nm after all but it took them several years to go from poorly yielding Cannon Lake/Ice Lake to okay Tiger Lake and good Alder Lake.  If we take the talk about 18A ""margins"" from the recent analysts call to be a euphemism for something like node yields and a stand in for when it will be ""fixed"" then we could be talking 2027 before 18A gets to that point.

Intel,"Yeah after being reminded that the LPE cores are also Darkmont like the E-Cores I looked up the layout in detail and the differences is simply the P and E cores are on a large Cluster with L3 Cache and a fast ring-bus, but the LPE cores are seperated from that Ring-bus and don't have any L3 Cache (just access to a ""memory side-cache"" accessible by the NPU and small cluster but not the large cluster).     They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them. The small cluster could be used to offload background tasks to themselves (if the powerlimits aren't hit), which could at least improve 1% lows and fps stability.",Neutral

No what he said is that the Arc B Series hasn't been around for all that long and the B580 has garnered a very positive reception so they felt in terms of branding and marketing moving in Panther Lakes Xe³ into the B series brand is a better marketing move than throwing away the B series branding and starting the C series branding now. In others words they want Panther Lake to ride on the momentum and positive vibes the B series branding has garnered.   Xe³ is a Xe³ based architecture like Xe³P is architecturally but there is more to selling a product than the engineering, keep in mind there's strong rumors that there will be a B770 launch, Intel also just released the B60 and later this year will provide a big software expansion to Bxx cards so the B series brand is still full of life. Xe³P will launch much later and at that point Intel feels there will have passed enough time to leave the B series branding behind.",Neutral
Intel,An alternative explanation could also be that Celestial dGPUs *are* launching as Xe3P and they would want the launch of C series iGPU and dGPU to be around the same time and the same architecture.,Neutral
Intel,">so the A, B, C, (etc) Series is just branding?  Wasnt it always so? Xe is the architectural names, ABC was just branding for customers.",Neutral
Intel,"No public announcements yet, but logically it would make all the sense for Intel to launch them, and do so in larger quantities so people in the market can get them at MSRP. Battlemage proved there is a lot more demand than there was supply, and it'd take too long to ramp it up once it became clear they were received well. With proof of a market test pass, they've now got a chance to do it right.  They are excellent value products that would allow Intel to get a chunk of that market, given they are available in sufficient quantities at intended price points.",Neutral

Intel,"They would be extremely stupid not to continue to release discrete graphics cards, even if they decide to release 2-3 gaming SKUs per new generation; entry/budget, mid-range, high-end, etc.  - they win. until they keep iterating up, maturing driver, increasing install user base, improving software, until the point they can target higher segments (enthusiast tier)  Gaming GPUs remain the flagship component that pushes the limits of silicon design, features like ray tracing, AI upscaling, and real time path racing all debut in gaming before trickling into pro and AI workloads. Every research report shows that demand for high-end GPUs is still strong. Steam HW survey shows the most popular GPUs are still mid-range gaming cards, showing that discrete GPUs remain central to the PC ecosystem.  And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",Neutral

Now I'm not saying it's a bad thing, Intel has a lot of inefficiencies with Battlemage, a lot of time you expect it perform better judging by the amount of hardware.

Intel,"Multi-Post News Generation, with three articles interpolated per source.",Neutral
Intel,I'm excited for Intels new GPU,Neutral
Intel,"Microsoft has been way too slow in the DX12U era, and Kronos is even slower. Microsoft's new APi that integrates AI upscalers isn't even out yet and it doesn't even cover Frame Gen or AI denoising. By the time MS moves to integrate those they'll be behind on something else.",Negative
Intel,"They aren't, though. FSR Frame Gen works on Nvidia Hardware",Neutral
Intel,Honestly we are gaining more from proprietary features than we lose from them being locked behind certain brands. Currently them being proprietary gives Nvidia an incentive to push the envelope and the head start they have isn't that big so they're incentivized to keep making new features   If everyone was required to share their new features then the incentive for innovation disappears,Neutral
Intel,Competition *,Neutral
Intel,Obligatory article quoting reddit post quoting another article quoting original reddit post.,Neutral
Intel,"Fake frames, fake articles! /s",Neutral
Intel,Sometimes I prefer vendor solutions today than waiting for microsoft for years like Direct Storage,Neutral
Intel,"I mean, surely it depends on when they have to share it. If they can release with the feature exclusively first, but then have to share at or after release, then it can still help the current generation of their cards until it's time for the new gen.",Neutral
Intel,"DirectStorage 1.1 (the actually usable version unlike 1.0) was supported by Windows 9 months after PS5 release. They werent that far behind on that, noone just was interested.",Neutral
Intel,"patents expire after 15 years, they will have to share it then.",Neutral
Intel,Nvidia controls 90% of the discrete GPU market on PC.   Anything proprietary that they make essentially becomes the standard going forward.,Neutral
Intel,"Huh?  1. RT in games is now done through DirectX APIs, which are vendor agnostic.   2. For GPU features, NVIDIA usually introduces them through a DirectX standard, they are just usually the first vendors to support it until others catch up.   3. RT is limited because current gen consoles are not good at RT. AMD took multiple years to adopt RT or AI acceleration cores.",Neutral
Intel,I actually have not seen an open source or even cross vendor solution with any reasonably quick uptake. Its a theoretical myth at the moment,Negative
Intel,the issue with RT isnt standard. Its that consoles/amdGPUs simply didnt support it for away too long.,Negative
Intel,"...It's down to 15 now? I thought it was 20.   Although. Software is more copyright than patent anyway, and copyright is, like, 70 years after the author dies, or 95 after publication for corporate works.",Neutral
Intel,"Depends on country/industry. Copyright also depends on country, but for most civilized word its authors death + 95 years (thanks disney). Copyright however has many exceptions to it, well, at least in the west. In Japan it does not and technically you can get sued for saying Zelda is fun because you broke copyright by saying Zelda without permission. Its why Nintendo is able to get switch reviews removed from youtube.",Neutral
Intel,The DirectX RT spec and SDK came out in 2018. The blame lies entirely on AMD. Imagine Nvidia waiting for AMD to agree,Neutral
Intel,I would imagine intel has to at least get celestial out the door before cutting off their GPU line. it's been so long in development that it would be more of a waste of money to cancel it then finish it and see how it sells. at least getting it to the public means some kind of ROI and a solid position in the lower end of the GPU market that AMD and Nvidia are abandoning to the used market.,Negative
Intel,"Okay then, what's the Xe GPU roadmap looking like then?",Neutral
Intel,"Hopefully Intel still thinks it needs discrete GPUs to compete in DataCenters and such.  Also GPUs for the ""edge""",Neutral
Intel,I can't claim to know the future or fate of Arc but I think if Nvidia wanted to kill it they could just price it out of the market instead of buying a stake in a company with a broadly uncertain future,Negative
Intel,They barely lived on before the deal.,Negative
Intel,"It'll live on our hearts, yes.",Neutral
Intel,Lol if you believe that I have a bridge to sell you in Brooklyn,Neutral
Intel,"You have to look at this from both sides.  This would give NVidia the ability to offer OEMs a tightly integrated on SOC gfx solution vs a separate discrete gfx package as it is now. This would lower costs for NVidia's customers as well as improve performance and Intel's cpu's get to ride that train.   Intel has a long track record of using integrated gfx so it's certainly right up their alley to take this on.  Could Xe gfx coexist with NVidia? Yep, I think so.  Xe could be the budget igfx option and iNVidia is the premium integrated solution. That's basically how it is now with Intel Arc/Battlemage & GTX.   On the DC side, Intel has absolutely no gfx solution at this time and won't have anything for at least two years.  Intel already sells NVidia when a gfx solutions are needed so tighter integrated products will benefit both sides in that DC space as well.",Positive
Intel,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work. And even if NVIDIA wants to keep Intel's fabs open, I doubt they want to run them either.",Neutral
Intel,Wonder if this investment is purely to keep intel going to avoid a monopoly issue in a few years.,Neutral
Intel,AMD is not going to release a next gen gaming gpu it just leaked and that’s what I’m worried about intel arc are ramping up.,Negative
Intel,"There's also a better then not chance this alliance would have gone the same way as most other nVidia semicustom things by the time Druid tapes out anyhow, and the leadership at Chipzilla likely know this.",Neutral
Intel,"While that might be true in the long term, it's not necessarily true for whatever quarter the execs are caring about at any particular moment.",Neutral
Intel,"Probably a chronologically changed version of what is known now.  No one with any savvy expects this alliance to last with nVidia's track record, so carrying it on makes sense in both being ready for the inevitable burnt bridge and possibly pushing it back.",Neutral
Intel,It's looking for 6 years of Xe3 in integrated graphics I'd guess.,Neutral
Intel,"Always selling out actually, they just can't produce that much",Negative
Intel,And I have another if you think nVidia is capable of keeping this deal running for that long...,Neutral
Intel,Intel will hopefully split their fab business from the rest of the company either way.,Neutral
Intel,"Im not sure what you are implying, but nvidia partnerships have historically not broken from their side as far as I know.   Apple gave them the boot, not the other way around.   AMD are the ones who rejected the Nvidia-AMD merger back in 2005.   Tesla kicked nvidia out as well, because they did not want to keep paying them to develop the tech.   If you are referring to AIB Partners, then that can hardly be called an actual partnership. That's more of a contracted labor and distribution agreement. Even then, XFX only got blacklisted because they were a premier partner who were seen as jumping ship when the going got a little rough with nvidia stalling between 2009-2010.",Neutral
Intel,> they just can't produce that much  because they are losing money on them,Negative
Intel,Trade bridges.,Neutral
Intel,Intel's arc is dead with or without nvidia deal.,Neutral
Intel,"Microsoft went with Nvidia for Xbox and it ended in a lawsuit.   Sony went with Nvidia once, and never again.  Apple ceased to bundle Nvidia GPUs because Nvidia sold them (and HP and Dell) huge quantities of faulty 8000M GPUs.",Negative
Intel,There is a reason why every nvidia partnership ends up breaking apart pretty quickly...,Negative
Intel,"Nvidia seems to make working with Nvidia too difficult for their partners to continue. It's the business version of someone emotionally bailing, and abusing you until you leave them.  They did that with smartphones, consoles, Linux, Apple, and likely countless other projects I didn't follow in as much detail.",Negative
Intel,"That really is up for debate. That they are losing money on them when you account for RNE and RnD amortized by unit, sure. That I have no doubt about.  But that is not the same thing as losing money on each card sold based solely on the bill of materials and distribution cost etc. Which is what actually matters when looking at if a product is ""sold at a loss"" or not.",Negative
Intel,"Hardly. Even after the bubble, Intel needs in house GPU, for both APUs and data center... which means they'll make a gaming version if the work is already mostly there.",Neutral
Intel,"In the case of Intel and Nvidia chipsets, it was Intel that decidedly ended the relationship, paying Nvidia off to exit the chipset business so that they could make integrated graphics.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, if nVidia has an Achilles' heel, it's their company culture's near total inability to do semicustom without fuckery, and it's the reason AMD dominates basically every high performance gaming graphics application outside of Windows desktops and laptops.",Negative
Intel,Well yes. But you do need to amortize the tape out and dev. costs over the production life cycle of the product. And with low volumes I'm not even sure AMD is accomplishing that. AMD is saved due to the console business funding dGPU tech development.,Neutral
Intel,"They've already cancelled every data centre GPU after Ponte Vecchio (which was forced out by DOE contract) despite reassuring us Rialto Bridge and Falcon Shore were on track as little as months before the chop, and their next is apparently Jagure Shore in 2028.   I have 0 hope that will actually happen.",Negative
Intel,">AMD dominates basically every high performance gaming graphics application outside of Windows desktops and laptops  And how much money is there in your ""everything else outside of ..."" vs Nvidia's entirety of consumer prebuilt desktop/laptop?",Neutral
Intel,">Well yes. But you do need to amortize the tape out and dev.   If they are selling above the manufacturing and distribution cost, they are amortizing those costs. Might not be much, but it beats not selling them.  They might still be ""losing"" money on them when all costs are included. But it would still make sense to make more of them and sell them, since each one sold still plugs that black hole of externalized costs. And would not be the reason for lack of availability.",Neutral
Intel,"*looks at effectively every current gaming system that isn't a PC, Intel claw, a phone, or the Switch*  A fair bit, and frankly, even if it's not that profitable, it defines more of the dynamics of this sector then you'd think if you're a PC type.",Neutral
Intel,"Not only is it not profitable for the chipmaker, the revenue isn't even anything to brag about looking at AMD's gaming section of their financial statements. 1.1 billion for Q2 2025, and that includes whatever miniscule sales there were for Radeon dGPUs.",Negative
Intel,This is the card Intel should have released instead of the gaming version(s). Took them 2 years,Negative
Intel,Far more than I expected them to come out at. Damn.,Negative
Intel,"Not worth it at $599, slightly worth it at $499  This has 1/2 the memory bandwidth of a 3090 and 70% the compute performance.",Negative
Intel,I’m getting one when it releases in Australia,Neutral
Intel,Thats great and all but when will there be stock? (Canada),Positive
Intel,Pytorch libs are getting better for intel and amd support but there are still a lot of 3090 cards on the used market and those don’t need hoops to jump through to get compute working.  If I was handed a budget this low by a boss I’d just ask them to buy a lot of 3090 cards.,Neutral

Intel,b580 should've allowed SR-IOV upon release. That's all the card really needs to sell.,Neutral
Intel,"Even at $599 it's significantly cheaper than a used 3090, comes with a full warranty, and can be bulk purchased new.  If you just need the VRAM, which is what this is targetting, I think it can definitely make sense.",Positive
Intel,"This is worth it at any price point.  I am getting tired of gamers not understanding that SR-IOV support and 200W are very important to some people. If there were a 24GB AMD card out there for 200W and $600 I would buy that too regardless of SR-IOV support.  Neither Nvidia nor AMD have a card at this price point with this feature set. You are looking at $600 for 24GB of VRAM and SR-IOV support. AMD's SR-IOV offerings are in the ""thousands of dollars"" and Nvidia's cards in this segment do not meet the 200W and 24GB of VRAM targets. The closest thing is the P40 and it's a decade old, has way higher power consumption and is about to be end of lifed.  Please tell me the card that exists in the same segment as the B60. I will wait.",Negative
Intel,"This is $150 cheaper than NVIDIA's competing A2000, which has less VRAM.  3090s do not get certified drivers, which are a business requirement for certain workloads.",Neutral
Intel,The 3090 does not have ECC on it's VRAM nor certified drivers,Neutral

Intel,"It barely makes sense, at $600.  3090s are $700 now and the new 5070Ti Super (faster than a 3090) is expected to come out at $750 soon. And you’d have CUDA for either the Nvidia 3090 or 5070Ti Super.   I strongly believe that $600 is the price Intel set to ward off the scalpers. The niche of the B60 is pretty tiny at $600.   It’ll make a lot more sense at $500, which I suspect is the “real” price a month or two after it goes on sale.",Negative

Intel,"B580 needed to get out very early to beat RTX 5060 and RX 9060 to the market. Nvidia's and AMD's cards outperform it in gaming raster performance thanks to having been in the market for much longer. They have the more efficient architecture and software for gaming. It wouldn't be great for marketing if Arc came out at the same time with similar pricing, yet got beaten in the FPS benchmarks.  But productivity cards could wait. Arc's always been very competitive in productivity tasks. Maybe because Intel has more experience in this department. So reliable driver is the focus here.",Positive
Intel,">Only if your marketing plan is to sell 0 gpus because who will buy gpu with bad driver and application support?  Good driver and application support is not possible to deliver without a significant install base of your product in the wild. PC configurations vary wildly and usually driver issues are about some bad luck combination of hardware, driver versions, and application versions.  The incumbency advantage in this market is immense.

B580 is still cheaper than 5060 and 9060 XT and even RTX 5050 and RX 7600, especially in the UK where you can find a B570 for only 20 pounds more than RTX 3050. That's way cheaper than RX 6600, it's a no brainer. But the prices could only go down thanks to economy of scale mostly. It's been produced for a while, that's why.  Also one of the big reasons it's still selling now is thanks to good publicity. Imagine if it came out as the same time as RX 9060 XT. HWU would tear a new hole regardless of how much of an improvement it is over the Alchemist cards and the impressive productivity performance.

I bought it in the U.S. Amazon store, shipped it into this 3rd party company's warehouse which will ship it to me. Takes 3 weeks in total. But, at least, I paid MSRP for the card + shipping and tarrifs that totaled $1,200.",Negative
Intel,"Late but I chose a B580 and have absolutely 0 regrets. Very stable performance, have been playing some lighter new games at 4k 60fps, and I know I'm going to be futureproofed vs the other cards in its price class due to the 12GB of VRAM. Yes the 9060XT 8gb is technically a stronger performer, I will trade a few frames today for longevity over time, which should also translate into much stronger resale value on the B580 in the future.  But it seems you are finding the 9060Xt for actually significantly cheaper, like $70. That difference might make it worth it to go with an 8gb card. It's not going to be unplayable of course, but I think you may have to upgrade a bit sooner than with the ARC",Positive
Intel,"I feel the B580 to in quite a sweet spot at the moment and I kind of don't see a reason not to go for it. It may not be the best card out there (neither is the 9060 8GB), but in 2025 I would 100% go for the 12GB card over a tad more performance as that will last longer when games start to get more demanding VRAM wise. Sad to see the prices you have to pay for one at the moment, but I also see them rising here and hovering around $325-385 while most of them were under $300 last week (I'm not in the US btw).",Positive

Intel,"Hey man, fellow Brazilian here. I know things are tough down here. I have not tried it yet, but everywhere I see right now, Intel is the king of cost x benefit. You can also help yourself by selling your card for about 600-700 reais, making your new card ""cost half"" if you go with the arc.  In the u future this will also help when you want to upgrade so your new card ""costs less"". I would go for the 12gb card because with the current landscape, games are demanding more vram and because of AI prices will shoot up.  If you need any help, dm me and I can try to help you out",Neutral

Intel,"Yeah, it's possible that I'll stay with the GPU for some time... So, the 12 GB having more longevity, even if the 9060 xt has more raw power... Maybe the safe thing is to get the B580.",Positive
Intel,"Right now sure... But what about longevity? I said that it's possible that I'll have this GPU for years, so... Won't 12 GB age better than raw power with 8 GB? Especially at 1440p.",Neutral
Intel,"Oh, I actually want my card. I have a home server and an NVDIA GPU would be nice for some stuff like transcoding. Also, I may be building a PC for my brother soon, so maybe the 1650 Super will go well in his PC for now. And if I buy another GPU in the future, I can pass the one I'll have for him too.",Positive
Intel,"Maybe I am wrong and the 9060 turns out to be the card that lives the longest, but if I had to make the call in that budget range personally, it would be the B580. Like you I don't really see a reason to go 8GB anymore. If Intel pulls out of the GPU market tomorrow, then I was wrong. If 8GB is not enough anymore by some release in June 2026, I was right. If you somehow could push the budget to the 9060 16GB, then that is a no-brainer as well. Difficult, but I do feel the B580 is very compelling.",Neutral
Intel,"I think raw power will come in more handy right now, and 8 GB is not the end of the life. Or spend a bit more on 16 gb.   You will need to make sacrifices when raw power runs out too.",Neutral

Intel,"I would take 8 GB 9060 Xt. Not a great choice for new AAA titles, but will rock everywhere else",Positive
Intel,I have a hard time affording upgrades too. This is why I would get the cheaper GPU which is also faster in most cases.   Is it possible to bring GPU when you visit Brasil?,Negative
Intel,"Makes sense. Thanks for the input, but ""not a great choice for new AAA"" titles makes me scratch my head, because I'm seeing the card being able to run new demading games on Ultra with more than 50 FPS and some games like Doom Dark Ages with more than 100 FPS max settings... You may have higher standarts, but that's absurd triple A performance for me...",Negative
Intel,"I am gaming at 4k if possible on RTx 5070   My last card was Rx 6650 Xt with 8 GB, and Rx 9060 Xt is much better. I think it is a good card, unless you run into rare cases where ram is not enough. So many great games where 8 GB will be plenty",Positive
Intel,"Makes sense, thanks for the input!  I agree, a lot of games that 8 GB is enough, but like, how the market is going, it seems like 8 GB is not being enough even today.  And I'm scared of having the card in 2 years or even more and being extremely limited by 8 GB.",Neutral
Intel,I'd build around a 5600/5700x and a 9060xt 16gb.  I've been running a 5600x and a 6750xt for 1440p gaming for 2.5 years and it's been solid.,Positive
Intel,"I have almost he same setup except I have a 2060 supra and a ryzen 3700.  I was thinking of just doing a 5070 12gb for now or a 4060 ti.  I think the CPU is doing fine for the most part.  I have a really hard time dropping 800 bucks for a GPU.  However its only going to get worse, so maybe after christmas.",Positive
Intel,"For gaming the GPU matters more, but as someone else said, try to upgrade both, if your budgets around $400 I would get a second hand 5600x or 5700x and a 9060xt. It trades with a 5060ti while being around $350, that way your GPU will probably more than double in performance, and your CPU will too.",Neutral
Intel,"Really should try to analyze your pc performance a little more before deciding that gpu is the weak link. A lot of your micro stuttering could be from cpu issues.  I posted in another comment chain, but using a tool like hwinfo64 or Intel presentmon can be useful.  Presentmon probably more so for analyzing what the problem is, as it easily can plot line graphs that show your framerate as it relates to gpu and cpu usage/spikes  IE : I could see a framerate dip when my gpu usage drops and cpu usage spikes. That is a cpu hitch.",Negative
Intel,Rx 9060 xt 16gb is your best option in that price range.,Neutral
Intel,"What is your CPU and RAM usage like on monitoring software while playing? If it's capping out on either, I would invest in one of those first.   DDR4 RAM is still relatively cheaper, but not as good as it once was. 32GB is the sweet spot if it is the problem.  If it is the CPU, get a Ryzen 7 5800X, if you cant get a x3D cache CPU. You will get FPS increases at the lowest settings, as it is more likely to be CPU bound there.  If it is truly a GPU bottleneck, get a used 4060 Ti 16GB if you cant get a 9060 XT 16GB.",Neutral
Intel,Good shout. This is literally the build I'm going with to make my own steam machine.,Positive

Intel,Okay I'll check it out. I was looking at some other threads and (not sure if this is good advice) read that if your gpu utilization is above 90% youre probably having gpu issues. I'm sure its more complex of a decision than that.,Negative
Intel,what kind of monitoring software do you use? I'll look into this a little deeper,Neutral
Intel,How soon do you expect a needed upgrade from your current build?,Neutral
Intel,"No that's not true at all. Gpus can run at 100% and be perfectly normal. That just means that the gpu is the (quote unquote) bottleneck.  My gpu is running at near 100% most of the time I play.  Being full gpu usage generally does not produce hard stutters and hitches. Those are normally from something else (the game just sucking, cpu hangs, shader compilation, traversal stutter)",Neutral

Intel,"For a live monitor like the stats you would see in video games, use MSI Afterburner and follow the guide for setting it up.",Neutral
Intel,I don't play new AAA titles so I'd expect it to get me five years at the very minimum. I was going to put an older card in it but the 9060 is pretty good value imo.  I also have an AM5 with a 5070 so this isn't my only rig but I suspect that once I put Steam OS on it that it'll become my most played system.,Positive
Intel,"The AIO is overkill for the 9600x, but then again, you already own it.   There's no downside to running a cooler that's ""too much"" for your CPU, aside from the fact that you might have been more cost effective. Many people run AIOs on efficient CPUs like the 7800x3d that don't need them, simply for aesthetic.   In your boat, I would probably sell the AIO and see if I could get $50 for it ($75 retail + tax), run the 212, and use the cash to buy lube for when you have to purchase RAM.   Merry Christmas!",Neutral
Intel,"As long as the temps are okay you'll be fine.   Also I have that same CPU/GPU setup and it's great for 1440p plus a second monitor (my second screen is 1080p). People who say the 9060XT 16GB is marginal for 1440p are clueless. I get 120+ FPS with settings cranked in every game I've tried, as long as I leave any path tracing options turned off.",Positive
Intel,"Worst case scenario for an air cooler is that a fan dies, but it's still a big heatsink. Worst case scenario for an AIO, the pump dies and the CPU is not cooled at all, or you get a coolant leak and potentially damage other components in your system. Unless, you actually need the additional cooling performance (which you don't here), it's just unnecessary risk.  Additionally, though, the MSI AIOs are hot garbage. That's why they give them away in bundles. Even if you go with an AIO, I wouldn't touch that one with a ten foot pole.",Negative
Intel,Both will be fine.   Go with whatever you like.,Positive
Intel,using the aio is perfect fine.,Positive
Intel,No you do not need a liquid cooler. The Hyper will be fine for what you want.   People really only use liquid cooling for noise reduction or really high end overclocking and workstation CPUs.   I’ve been running a be quiet air cooler on my overclocked 3800x for years and temps never get above 60c in anything I use it for.,Neutral

Intel,the issues an aio would in theory have are incredibly rare. you'd probably be more likely to have a failing fan vs the pump failing,Neutral

Intel,What would be wasting money?,Neutral
Intel,32 GB should be plenty.,Neutral
Intel,"technically incorrect but still there is no real worry unless you bend the pump in a harmful way, which would be difficult",Negative
Intel,For regular gaming it’ll be fine. If you want to overclock or do heavier workstation tasks the Hyper will not handle the heat. If you wanna do that get a beefier air cooler like a be quiet or use the AIO,Neutral

What comes to FSR and DLSS in general, the higher your native resolution is the better it works. 1080p is nowhere as good as 4k but some artifacts will still appear, FSR might do some stuff better and DLSS something else better.

Intel,"I also have a 9070 XT and no issues at all, definitely wouldn’t need to “upgrade” it can handle pretty much everything and there’s not much difference for the £200 difference",Positive
Intel,"If you're not happy and can afford it, then switch.   Personally though I would try everything to make it work first. I'm also after buying a 9070XT recently and its been great. I saw that people were having issues on the latest drivers, so I skipped out on that and went straight to the 25.9.2 instead of latest and I haven't had so much as a blip. Also if you've switched from an Nvidia card before the 9070XT, make sure you have run DDU (honestly probably good to run it anyway).",Positive
Intel,"So, many people giving somewhat outdated info or anedotical experiences, so take all with a pinch of salt. Personally I would tell you to try this 9070XT in a machine with a clean windows install and some small differences in hardware to see what's happening, but that usually is not an option for most. As it may very well be a problem with your card, or your configuration, and you're still within the return window from what i can infer, just return it and get another gpu, either another 9070XT or a 5070TI, hell, even a 5070/9070 would already be neat. And when those arrive, don't forget to use ddu.",Neutral

FSR4 was supposed to fix it, but eyes eyes can't lie to you.",Negative
Intel,One cheap option is the steam app Lossless Scaling to squeeze every last FPS and upscaling out of your current equipment without having to make a perhaps unadvised GPU purchase. Playability through higher FPS with some negatives is worth a whole lot more than the $8USD outlay.,Neutral
Intel,Nvidia is to blame for the current state of GPU/RAM prices and the general state of AI. Don't give them a single dime.,Negative
Intel,"Do you have driver timeouts or full pc crashes? Do you use 2 individual 8pin connectors? Do you have new drivers?  About shimmer, you can try virtual super resolution, so render in 1440p and downscale it with FSR quality to 1080p. This should give you a better image, but shimmering of shadows and ambient occlusion is one of the problems of UE5, even though Arc Raiders is the best UE5 games.",Neutral
Intel,"I game with quite a variety of friends. Even with the recent issues regarding windows and newer Nvidia drivers, I can tell you with confidence that while AMD has come a LONG way in the past 6 years, Nvidia is still the most stable. When someone I'm playing with is having a weird crash issue, or graphical bug, or ""this setting going on is a no no"" they ALWAYS have an AMD.   With that said they're stable like 95% of the time, but that 5% can be a real ballache especially in certain games. That $200 all depends on your financial situation and wants and needs. I'm not up to date on benchmarks (still got my 3080 going strong) but if the 5070ti is the same or better in terms of fps it's a sidegrade I myself would heavily consider. Also DLSS and framegen is much better than AMDs alternative although it is catching up.",Positive
Intel,"Im also considering switching to a 5070ti from a 9070xt it’s a $100 price where im at.Since updating to 25.12.1 one game specifically(Hogwarts) crashes every time I try to run it. I’ve also seen that dlss performs better on older titles compared to fsr 3,2,1. Currently reinstalling windows as a last ditch effort, hopefully that fixes it.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes upscalers work better with higher resolution. Having more pixels means creating less information from nothing. Also in a lot of games FSR4 still have worse input than DLSS, devs still need more time to implement better the tech, FSR4 is really fresh",Neutral
Intel,"when you changed from your previous GPU did you follow the proper driver uninstall procedure? if you had an NVIDIA GPU before, did you use DDU in safe mode? any other hardware changes at the same time? did you consider a fresh windows install?",Neutral
Intel,"AMD isn't perfect with the driver. Use DDU to remove video driver and try a version older.  A certain combination of hardware and driver is probably causing some of AMD driver to sputter or crash.  When I first got my 7800xt, I had to go back 2 months before I got stable and clean run.",Negative
Intel,"I have a friend with a 9070 XT playing arc raiders daily for way too many hours with zero crashes. At least they never mention it or complain about it in Discord voice chat.  Are you getting any information or feed back as to why the crash is happening? Any specific errors or messages?  Was this a fresh new build plus new windows installation, with this GPU. If not, did you use DDU when installing your drivers?  I would 100% look up how to turn off Windows finding and installing drivers, and then try a ddu driver reinstall. I keep seeing people having issues with Win11 (maybe Win10 as well?) corrupting their GPU drivers by trying to update them for no reason.  Maybe a 5070 Ti would fix it, maybe it wouldn't. But if a majority of people aren't crashing then it's probably not the GPU itself.",Negative

Intel,Battlefield crashing is a driver thing that doesn’t care whether it’s AMD or NVIDIA,Negative
Intel,"I have no shimmer with framegen on my 5080, only using 2x framegen, but I've put most of my graphics at cinematic and I'm playing in 4k. Personally, to me, the stuff you get with the Nvidia card is worth the extra money, and I don't think you would regret switching at all. My game also hasn't crashed once yet although ive only played for about 12 hours so far",Positive
Intel,I run a 9070XT hellhound on both games that is undervolted and do not feel a need to run FSR in max settings native 1440p regularly pulling over 120fps in arc raiders higher in bf6. I have had zero issues with crashes or shimmer. I actually bought the 9070XT because it was so similar in performance to a 5070ti for substantially less money. It is not worth the upgrade in my opinion and you should turn off FSR in 1080p. I would recommend doing a full graphics driver uninstall and check to see the rest of your hardware or some external issue is not a bottleneck.,Neutral
Intel,"If you’re getting crashes, I’d return it. Performance doesn’t matter if it’s unstable. The 5070 Ti costs more, but you’ll get better driver stability and cleaner upscaling, especially at 1440p.",Neutral
Intel,"I'd personally prefer the 9070xt even if the 5070 Ti was $600.  You're going to occasionally get graphical weirdness with nVidia too.  But I'm also a Linux user, so there's that.",Neutral
Intel,Why are you using FSR with such a powerful GPU at 1080p?,Neutral
Intel,"Shimmer is there in Nvidia too and I play at 4k native (well I did, cinematic settings made me use Dlss) You need to put crank up the foliage setting to cinematic mode but it will be a decent hit to fps.  Although if you really only plan to play arc raiders. Nvidia performance significantly better with that game because it uses a special engine version made by Nvidia. If you play other games too keep the 9070xt.  Also yeah the new drivers suck for some reason with the games released after. Try some from the 25.9.x and use the amd special uninstaller.",Neutral
Intel,"I have the 9070xt hellhound and 5600x, and was having frequent crashes in BF6 as well.  What helped me was to turn OFF smart access memory, and avoid any over locking settings.  I can’t recall if I checked any other settings, but recently it’s been much more stable after updates.",Neutral

Intel,Download 25.12.1 drivers. DDU in safe mode and install 25.12.1.,Neutral
Intel,"i'm sorry for saying this, but this is the biggest ""skill issue"" post i've seen in a while.  as others have said, get a better monitor, since either of these cards is an overkill for 1080p.  but if you're going to stick with 1080p, you shouldn't be using FSR at all. you have more than enough chooch to run any game natively at ultra settings on 1080p.  and always install latest drivers",Negative
Intel,depends. your crashes may be some rogue nvidia files if your previous gpu was an nvidia unit. there is no reason to pay an extra 200 over the 5070ti,Negative

Intel,I would do it for CUDA alone,Neutral
Intel,arc raiders is heavily nvidia favored at 30 percent faster but overall I would say no,Neutral
Intel,Have you tried going for a 3060 ti as it is nvidia which is vastly superior to amd. I bought this 5 years ago and personally have seen zero crashes on my favourite games like my little pony series or dream daddy: dad dating simulator. With the power of this nvidia card you should be seeing around double the performance you are getting now with no upscaler as nvidia usually makes vastly superior cards that annihilate anything AMD makes even years down the line.,Positive
Intel,"Gaming crashes may be due incorrect/too low some voltages for CPU/memory controller. It is just that in combination with an AMD card it tends to crash games more often. Especially when u just slapped XMP/EXPO profile on RAM and called it a day.  Plus Microsoft system tends to fk up GPU recently, and AMD in particular (Nvidia isn't a safe bet here either). I would test CPU/RAM first, that's what I am saying.",Negative

Intel,"No wonder mate, FSR looks like crap. Always. Yes it shimmers, flimmers, ugly artefacts especially on Bushes/trees and more. FSR imo ALWAYS looks WORSE than native..  While DLSS, I own RTX 5070 TI & 2080, and tried @1080p 60, 1440p 144hz & UWQHD 165hz, even in direct screenshot comparison often looks even better than Native, (through better AA, it can take a bit of sharpness on 1080-1440p tho. But that's what DLAA is for.  Also I guess that's the reason why many (I guess only AMD owners) hate on AI upscaling and praise native... Those who never tried DLSS Q, or DLAA.  But actually I wouldn't upgrade from 9070 XT to 5070 Ti, either go with at least 5080, or wait for super/60 series.  But yes. U can't even compare DLSS to FSR. FSR is a joke 🤣 even the first Intel upscaler XeSS on their very first GPUs, is better than AMD's FSR 3.  So, it's: DLSS 4 > DLSS 2 > XeSS 1 >= PSSR > FSR 2-4.  FSR = literally the worst. Makes everything look worse. Not worth the fps imo (expect u need it to get to 60fps) but upgrading for that kinda money, no I'd wait for 60 series..",Negative
Intel,This was what I ended up doing this week. I was caught up in the get a gpu before prices go up talk. Then realized I still would have a 1080p 60hz monitor so would not even see any of the performance over my current card.,Neutral

Intel,What bugs are there on the Nvidia side? I haven't noticed any issues,Neutral
Intel,"Agree that Windows 11 has been very buggy. Never had those issues with Win 10.  I've noticed random issues with Win 11 lately:  \-Work laptop (integrated GPU) goes blue screen of death and reboots randomly -alarmingly close to when updates are pushed.    \-Brand new home rig (9800X3D|RTX 5080) has been a tad glitchy on Win 11 -not bad but annoying (program crashes, HDR issues). glitches tend to go away with a reboot.  no issues when I run Linux (dual boot Win/CashyOS).  \-Old rig (6600k|GTX 1070) was a disaster after upgrading from Win 10 to Win 11. that's the main reason why I built the new rig (and the BS long-term Microsoft limitation for future upgrades due to CPU being ""non compliant""). it was strong as a bull with Win 10.  \--> being 100% honest, given the insane increase trend in component prices, it was a blessing that I was forced to build a new rig!",Negative
Intel,"FSR4 native is not doing any upscaling, just AA superior to FAA",Negative
Intel,He’s not upscaling. He’s basically using Dlaa with fsr 4,Neutral
Intel,This. My 4k tv is technically 60hz but seems to like 80-100fps best with my rig to minimize microstutter and input lag. I use fsr to adjust fps up to around 100 and then leave it alone.,Neutral
Intel,Now stalker 2 started crashing for me.. everything was fine like a week ago,Positive
Intel,I still use my 6800 on 4k. Does 60+ fps on anything outside of UE5 games or cyberpunk lol,Neutral
Intel,"Totally agree with you for most people's use.  I was reading a post from a competitive FPS (first-person shooters) who uses top-config rigs at 1080p to squeeze out more frames per second (spelling out the acronym to avoid confusion  🤣).  It's definitely not my use case, as I tend to prefer resolution quality over insane speed. Reading the post opened my eyes to a completely different need/goal/use case.  for him it was all about frames per second and super high screen refresh.  I don't think it's the case for this post, but wanted to share the different perspective because it was a very interesting learning for me.",Neutral
Intel,I’m running maxed out settings on 1440 on bf6 and getting 140-160fps on my 9070xt,Neutral
Intel,"Crashes in BF6? BF6 pretty damn stable I think...I have 9070xt and over 200 hours in BF6, played on 3 different drivers, it's pretty stable. I've had maybe 3-4 driver crashes at most in those long hours and long sessions, mostly on the last driver, which is nothing (and I highly doubt people saying they've never crashed have as many hours as I have).   Basically I don't believe Bf6 has any known widespread issues with AmD or Nvidia but with PC gaming there's always someone having some issues and others/most who are fine..",Positive

Intel,"A good rule of thumb is don’t necessarily trust Reddit when you see issues like driver problems. It’s usually the small vocal percentage sharing the problems while the majority of people are fine.  I have owned a 9070 XT since release day and I upgrade my drivers on the day of release every single time. Often even running pre release drivers.  I used to work in IT so I’m a serial updater by nature. Never have old drivers on my pc.  I game every single day and I have never once had driver issues. I have had a handful of driver timeouts since release which were always caused by aggressive undervolts and overclocks on my part.  My point being you got nothing to lose trying out the latest drivers as you will more than likely be 100% fine.  Most crashes are caused by other unrelated issues. At least that was my experience working at a custom gaming pc shop. Most problems we fixed stemmed from outdated chipsets, bios, aggressive RAM overlocks and any number of things. The majority of the time it wasn’t actually AMD or Nvidia drivers.  Now that’s not to say they don’t have issues they do but I would look elsewhere first if I was diagnosing crashing.",Neutral
Intel,I would say check the used market.  Ppl are selling off their 40 series cards and you might get a good deal on a super.  I just someone post on fb a 4080s ventus for 1k CAD last week and it sold in a few days.,Neutral
Intel,Can you explain how a GPU is limited when it's at 100% usage and the CPU isn't close?,Neutral
Intel,"Based on the error messages, it looks like the issue is related to driver timeouts, and I’ve already tried just about everything to fix it.  Is that shimmering issue present on NVIDIA as well? If not, it’s definitely tempting to switch, especially since I’m planning to keep the GPU for several generations.",Neutral
Intel,New PC with a clean Windows reinstall.,Neutral
Intel,source: just trust me bro,Neutral
Intel,hes using FSR native which isnt upscaling,Neutral
Intel,Maybe he wants to use his GPU for a long time. If you're on 4k then you constantly have to move the latest and greatest while if you're on 1080p then you can chill on 9070XT for a long ass time.,Neutral
Intel,"Microsoft stated that 30% of their Windows code base is AI generated. If that is true, chances are that every GPU is affected.  First do a driver update, if things don’t improve, test another game for stability.   If both or more games are equally unstable, chances are MS messed up. If just BF is affected, then those devs messed-up. Hope it helps.",Negative

Intel,"People forget that lots of games out there are old.  I've been playing old games at 4K on my 1080 for over 8 years at this point.  Most modern games are optimized for 2020 era consoles, which are relatively weak, and every game before that?  Easier to run.  The point is, that everyone should be buying monitors today with 4K gaming in mind.  Monitors last longer than GPUs anyways, and even with an ancient GPU, 4K gaming is still possible with older game titles.",Neutral
Intel,"Some people want 360fps+ for their 360hz 1080p monitor for better twitch-shooter reaction time. Some people just want 60fps+ for their 4k tv. If a ps5 pro can get 60fps in baulders gate 3 in 4k with upscaling, then normal people would be very happy to get 120fps at the same on a pc. At one point it was 1.5x the cost to get 2x the performance of a ps5 pro... with today's ram prices it is closer to 2x the cost for 2x though... so unless you really *need* those extra frames I have a feeling consoles are going to be sticking around another generation or two.",Neutral

Intel,"If I understood the question correctly, during intensive use, do you have a low CPU usage percentage compared to the GPU, which is working at 100%, correct? Well, if this is the situation, then you have reached an optimal system. In the classic bottleneck, we would have a CPU always at high values ​​(between 80 and 100%) and a GPU that doesn't reach 90%, for example. Here, the GPU would be limited by the CPU, which, unable to render correctly, doesn't give the GPU the right inputs to be able to fully express itself. Games like Battlefield must have low CPU percentages and very high GPUs. If you played Star Citizen, for example, or any other open-world MMO where the CPU works more than the GPU, you would always see the CPU at high values, precisely because it is the processor that loads the world while the GPU draws it, the CPU manages the NPCs and events in the world, so the more complex the virtual life system, the more the CPU will be sucked up. Today, x3D v cache CPUs work wonders. I tried to simplify the discussion and hope it's understandable.

Intel,Well if you find it for that low go with the 5070ti.  Performance is rougly on par between the two gpus.  Im just saying 2nd hand is an option.    Also the price I stated is in CAD not USD and you can always haggle it lower but it depends on you charisma level.,Negative
Intel,"So it isn't the resolution but a combination of factors that vary wildly between different games, settings, and use-cases?  Why do people blanket recommend a higher resolution then without knowing any other variables like in this post? Especially with more and more demanding games releasing every year? Is it just the easiest way to balance a high cpu usage rather than upgrading?   How would the cpu be doing less work at higher resolution anyway? Wouldn't it be doing the same work if not more? Higher resolution just gives more work to the gpu, which makes it take longer to do its work, which gives cpu more time, but performance doesn't seem like it's being gained.",Neutral

Intel,"Here, we should get more technical. Yes, specific cases change the hardware needs, which is why a CPU for rendering is diametrically opposed to one for gaming, for example. In the former, we need a multi-core CPU, the latter needs a very powerful single core. Regarding resolution, yes, I know it seems strange, but new technologies don't adapt well to the ""old world,"" so to speak. If the drivers are up to date, the monitor has at least 140 MHz, and the graphics settings are calibrated correctly, raising the resolution, DirectX, and DLSS will ensure the system is fluid. Provided you have high-end hardware. The human eye only perceives between 60 and 80 fps, so playing at 300 or 80 won't make any difference to your brain, and many people don't understand this. But by increasing the graphics quality and the various shaders, the perception changes, and even lowering the fps will give you a smoother and more pleasant experience.

The refresh rate is mainly what matters here when you're talking about what the human eye perceives in this case because that is what is pushing the frames to the monitor for your eyes to see. We are capable of seeing much higher than 80fps and are capable of perceiving much more than just that one set of data at a time.  But even then that doesn't take into account input lag and frametime and how those are affected with higher framerates even in limited scenarios. 120 fps at 60hz is still a noticeable improvement over 60fps with benefits of more up to date frames and reduced input lag.",Neutral

Intel,"Probably looking at motherboard, ram, and CPU upgrade since they all have to be done at once. I’d go AMD, 7000 series or higher (am5 motherboard platform)  Then, I’d upgrade the power supply to 650 minimum, to prepare for the last thing  Which is the gpu. Yours is still beyond ok, so this is last.",Neutral
Intel,Because of memory prices if you can find a cheap 14th generation CPU and B760 DDR4 motherboard reuse your other parts. If money is no issue probably others have mentioned something AM5 for future upgradability.,Neutral
Intel,"First try updating your drivers, could just be a simple fix.  Could it also be possible that the psu is overloaded? Hopefully someone with a little more knowledge on here can help",Neutral
Intel,I personally don't think it's worth it,Negative
Intel,"your CPU is still fine for those games, at 1440p you will quickly become GPU limited anyway.",Neutral
Intel,I think the better deals are the Microcenter ones with 32GB. Otherwise I wouldn’t do it to downgrade to 16,Positive
Intel,What is your gpu?,Neutral
Intel,"No, not in my opinion.",Neutral
Intel,"It might be worth considering if you see GPU performance loss/low GPU utilization in games when using a performance overlay.   When I had a 5600 I was using a 6800xt (similar performance to 3080/4070 excluding ray tracing) and it was a good pairing at 1440p ultrawide, but I spoke with a few people using a similar setup at regular 1440p who mentioned they do see the CPU limiting GPU performance in some games, so at 1440p I'd anticipate you would see performance loss depending on the game/settings at 1440p with a 5070. At 4k you are a lot less likely to be CPU limited though.   Would that be 2 sticks of 8gb DDR5 or one 16gb stick? If one stick, I'd also check how much performance you might lose also.",Neutral
Intel,"One will let you play every future title that's CPU-bound on a 5600x and increase performance on titles that 5600x's don't do great on (there's not many titles, but some definitely are <60FPS-85FS).  The other will let you play every title that's RAM-bound or RAM-effected with 16GB. There's not many currently out there, but some newer releases like Doom The Dark Ages recommend 32GB and have 16GB as a performance affecting minimum recommendation.  Remember that you can also sell your platform locally. 2x16GB DDR4 RAM alone is ~$100 or more, your CPU is probably $30-60 depending on model, and B550/X570 AM4 motherboard are probably $70-80+. I had luck selling my 5600 AM4 platform/RAM  locally for over $200, but DDR4 & motherboards have probably increased 25% or more since then.   No one has a crystal ball as to whether a 5600x or 16GB of RAM will be more hindering for new releases 2-3 years from now, but I'd rather be sitting on AM5 used parts in 2-3 years than AM4 used parts.   Newegg has a 2x8 B850M-E/2x8GB bundle for $170 currently. Microcenter has a full ATX B650E/7600x/1x16GB bundle for $320. (They also have 7600x for $180 to complete the Newegg bundle).   2x8GB will give you better performance, but that bundle will cost you more. 1x16GB will be more future relevant when paired with an identical stick of RAM, but will have worse performance. Looks like an identical 1x16gbs are Ebaying for about $130 (possibly due to this deal), which is actually cheaper than used 2x8GB and might be the cheapest CL36 6000mhz RAM that I'm currently aware of (if you don't count the 7800X3D Microcenter bundle).",Neutral
Intel,No. I wouldn't do it.,Negative
Intel,"Depends on if you're wanting more frames AND you're CPU-bottlenecked.

Intel,"Good point, I think I needed someone to tell me it’s not worth downgrading ram capacity to get on ddr5",Neutral
Intel,"Sorry, I should have included that and edited that in now. I recently got a 5070",Neutral
Intel,I'm starting to gain a better understanding of how to balance CPU and GPU performance. I had been using afterburner but it was not giving me accurate 1% lows. I set up capframex and I'm having better success with that. My plan has been to evaluate my current setup for a while. Just got a bit of FOMO seeing some mobo/ddr5 deals.

Intel,"So you're saying if I'm going to go AM5 at some point, might as well save up for an X3D?",Neutral
Intel,"to be honest the 5800x3d I've seen go for close to $400 in some instances, he mind as well just get a 7600x3d or 7800x3d and buy some used ram on facebook marketplace or r/hardwareswap for cheaper than retail rate. literally can be up to 50% off retail on ram.  and all of this will be the same price as a 5800x3d, well not if he went with a 7800x3d in retail that'll be a hundred more or so",Neutral
Intel,Nope just went from 5600x to 7600x3d not a big enough upgrade for the cost. Enjoy the 5070 you made the right decision with it.,Neutral
Intel,Yeah it’s not worth downgrading right now.,Negative
Intel,Definitely not worth it to swap. Stick with your 5600x. Also 16gb DDR5 is probably not great: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/zvy63q/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/zvy63q/),Negative
Intel,yeah definitely would waant to get a x3d ship if you're already thinking about going for the 7600x they do have a 7600x3d chip for not too much more. I saw it going for 200 at microcenter. bundle came out to 300 I believe. it's more powerful than the normal 7600x and does better in games.,Positive
Intel,"That's good feedback, thanks. Cheers",Positive

Intel,"The best card here is about 2.3% better than the worst. I'd chalk that up to run-to-run variance especially with only 3 runs each. I'd be willing to bet some of these individual cards had a similar spread in results.  This is entirely normal. No two cards are entirely identical. One might have a tiny bit better cooler mounting or need a tiny bit less voltage to hit top clocks, and that one will be a tiny bit faster.  If you were to overclock or undervolt and chase a record, that top performer is the first one I would try first, but they are all so close that any one of these could be the technically best one.",Positive
Intel,Any idea on how the temps vary with those scores?,Neutral
Intel,"That doesn't look like too much of a variance to me, I bet nvidia and amd cards would act the same. Not all chips are equal, the silicon lottery determines what you get",Neutral
Intel,Seems within margin of error,Neutral
Intel,pretty close. was thinking of a sparkle b580 as my upgrade as well.,Neutral
Intel,"Neet data. Not many people test a bunch of the same card against itself.  I know with cpus they talk about the ""silicone lottery"" - extreeme overclockers would look for the best CPUs and get a few percent extra performance. I'd guess thats whats happening here.",Neutral
Intel,"Furmark is known for a *lot* of run to run variance. You'd need to do something like ten runs, discard the outliers, and average them.  It's not very useful as a benchmark, doesn't run long enough, which is why you won't see many folk using it as a benchmark: It's a stress test.",Negative
Intel,"So we're talking about about Standard deviation of 78.2 and mean of 9187.6, which means less than 1% deviation from the mean for about 84% percentile of the cards.

Intel,what?!? how did you fit the gpu?,Neutral
Intel,"Yep, they have 2 chip models with one permitting factory of and one not. And the ones permitting also tend to get you higher speeds  But for example if you buy an aorus card, chances are you can't go any higher because the chip couldn't make it to be an xtreme model.

Intel,as others have mentioned currently the best bang for buck is intel for vram and also i got all of these cards for super cheap around 200-240 each also i dont want to support nvidia at all they can go fuck themselves and as for amd there is very little llm support on their cards,Negative
Intel,"that is 6 b580 carts at 12GB each right now they are selling for like 260 USD each at some retailers so that is 1,560 USD all before tax that is.  And you get 72GB vram to use as long as you have a system for using this.  And 3060 12gb are going for about 300-350 and the 5060 ti 16gb is going for about  400-450  then the 9060xt 16gb is going for about 380-450.  so the 3060 12gb is out, it is way to much  Then lets say he got 5 9060 XT 16gb at 380 that's 1900 and that would be 80 GB of vram or 4 cards at 1520 with 64GB of vram.  Then their is the 5060 ti 16gb it would be even more.  With Vulkan API working with different LLM stuff it is easy to use just about all cards now, aside from the compile process if you want to get maximum performance. Other wise LMStudio will get you going with Vulkan fairly decently.  EDIT: My mistake you can get the B580 right now for 239.99 from B&H photo.",Neutral
Intel,Nvidia tends to be the most performative for AI but also most expensive. Intel is the best bang for buck if you're going for high vram counts. It'll be slower but at least the model fits. Amd isn't really a player in the AI space yet,Neutral

Intel,beelink gti 14ultra look it up it has a full pcie slot,Neutral
Intel,"It is hard to predict how chips will overclock. We've had generations where CPUs were apparently binned very conservatively, so even way down the range chips would overclock like crazy (Intel Core 2nd gen) or allow you to unlock whole extra fully functional cores (AMD Phenom triple cores), but we've also seen generations where most headroom was already 'priced in' (Intel 13th/14th gen) or arguably even exceeded. We've seen generations with more and less headroom on the GPU side as well.  That being said, now that consumer GPUs are competing with AI chips, they'll want to squeeze every inch out of each wafer, so I suspect they'll bin things as tightly as possible.",Neutral

Intel,"The B770 feels like it is going to disappoint people. People want a 5070 TI competitor, but it seems more like a 5070 competitor, which could be great for the market.   Their tech suite is starting to feel a bit dated though. Frame gen is fine, but no RT denoiser like AMD and Nvidia is something that could use resolving, but the biggest is XESS XMX slipping into a relatively distant fourth place behind DLSS transformer, FSR ML, and DLSS CNN. A new transformer based architecture could really deliver a boost they need.    As for panther lake it is promising. An efficient yet reasonably powerful architecture with ML hardware for XESS is quite compelling in the gaming space with laptops and handhelds, but also low power laptops. Great encoding and decoding with WiFi 7 is quite nice too. Seemingly it will deliver better performance than stuff like the z2 extreme in the handheld market which is something we desperately need since it was such an incremental jump. Hopefully more big manufacturers consider Intel.   Nova lake is a lot of question marks right now, but it might be reasonably competent which is what we need from Intel. Even if they can’t match the 10800x3d or whatever they might be really viable competition for something like that 10700x or if they managed to do a really big jump the 10950x3d mega chips. I really want to see Intel succeed.  It isn’t good that AMD are starting to creep into the Nvidia style position for high-end CPU. Much like Nvidia in the GPU market has basically sole dominance over the 5080 and upward calibre of product. AMD is kind of dominating when it comes to their x3D processors for high-end gaming performance. That is never a position you want companies to be in.",Negative
Intel,"There is a terrible situation in the CPU's, AMD is dominating, and I will never trust Intel while having the government funding them publicly. Wish Nvidia did something cool in that, but I doubt that, they will probably make some shady movements there too.",Negative

If you are unfamiliar with the tool, I recommend following their guideline for the process.  Disable internet > boot into safe mode > run DDU and select your platform > clean and restart. Internet should stay disabled until you install the drivers so that Windows doesn't auto install something before you do.   P.S.

I've other very interesting thing they could do is go heavy on vram, not because it's needed for games but because it's needed for bigger at home AI models.

Intel,I’ll be watching this with interest. I love my b580 and I’ve had 0 issues with it regardless of whatever crap about them gets spouted online. Never had a crash or driver issue related to the card and the driver update have been coming hard and fast bringing improvements   If these are priced right I’ll be upgrading and replacing my wife’s 3060 with my b580,Positive
Intel,Motherfucker I just bought a B580 because I thought this thing was a myth!,Negative
Intel,I’d sell my 4070s to support them if they can hit the same amount of performance level. I know sounds redundant as hell but need to have more competition in the gpu space,Neutral
Intel,"Why do I suspect that even if this exists, it exists in the area of the curve where power usage explodes and performance stagnates?",Negative
Intel,Gross.  You guys know higher tdp is bad right? It’s literally a measure of power consumption.,Negative
Intel,"The B580 is 4060 performance at almost 200 watts, it's probably gonna be 4070 levels.",Neutral
Intel,"""5070 Performance!""",Neutral
Intel,Just from sales standpoint 1%->2% means 100% more sales. Which is allright ?,Neutral
Intel,They can make it $150 and it still won't increase market share.,Negative
Intel,Well if Nvidia pulls a crucial and stops selling consumer cards then Intel has a shot!,Neutral
Intel,"At 300w TDP it better be, but definitely not at that price.",Neutral
Intel,"Can't wait for first qtr of 2027 to see them!  Honestly quite annoyed with this launch, they are seemingly having issues at this point. Battlemage has been out for a whole year with no news, only leaks of the 700 series cards.",Negative
Intel,"Judging by the late timing maybe they were ""uncancelled"" =p",Neutral
Intel,"That's assuming performance scales linearly with power consumption, I'm not saying it doesn't but that's not really something we can verify without some hard data.",Neutral
Intel,Oof I'm hoping around 5070,Neutral
Intel,I'll take that. The speed bump that comes with fitting everything in vram for AI outclasses raw power by a mile,Neutral
Intel,With the price of memory right now dont count on it.,Negative
Intel,Honestly if it’s 399 and hitting 5070/9070 performance. I’m buying in a heartbeat,Positive
Intel,"Not to ruin your day, but selling your 4070S just to ""support"" them is IMO a stupid decision.  The support you ""provided"" is completely negligible, literally a water droplet in a lake. In exchange, you get a far worse experience in your performance, software, power efficiency and compatibility.  All of that just so that you can feel right in your own PoV lol. Selling it doesnt change the fact that you already gave Nvidia your money.  You will be of bigger help by just keeping your 4070S and instead recommending Intel GPUs to your friends and other people who want to build a new PC (assuming Intel nails the pricing right). Spread the word instead, and dont sabotage yourself.",Negative
Intel,But with TDP performance goes in pair. NVIDIA nailed it and they are low TDP high performance. Thats why they are 90%. But to get some traction you have to compete in performance much more then in TDP. Thats what most games care for - FPS.,Negative
Intel,I doubt you're the only person here who was smart enough to put that together u/flatroundworm.,Negative
Intel,4070 and 5070 are extremely close.,Neutral
Intel,"""4090 Performance!""",Neutral
Intel,"Why not? As others have mentioned, their market share is already successfully increasing. There's no reason to think a new desirable GPU wouldn't continue that trend.",Negative
Intel,"Exactly.  If they were smart, they just build what others don't and build something no one can currently compete with.  Build big and take the sales.   There are three challenges.  One, it needs to be good enough to be on par with the 5070/5080/9070XT.  It needs to be a viable alternative, not 30% worse but on par, however they need to do it.  Two, they need to build a feature no other manufacturer has.  This is the vram part.  Go big.  Make it do something no one can compete with for a period of time   Three is the bigger challenge, but it might or might not matter to certain people.  This is cost and efficiency.  If the cost can be competitive to the 5070 and 9070 XT, they will get considerable sales, not like 1%, but as many sales as they can build for.  The second part efficiency.  If they can be highly efficient, they could market a budget option for AI use, not necessarily fastest but efficient for the work load.  This too could promote a significant sales volume just because it costs less at scale.   But, if very little is as achievable, you can always have a feature no one else has, and you can still sell quite well.",Neutral
Intel,If it's 32 Xe cores (up from 20 on the B580) that'd likely put it somewhere more like a 6800XT or 5060Ti :(,Neutral
Intel,It prevents someone else giving Nvidia their money while propping up intel - if more people did it like this mad lad it would make a difference,Neutral
Intel,"I bought the card used lol , no way I’d pay over msrp . But your statement stands true .",Neutral
Intel,It’s closer to 4070ti. It’s a 23% improvement over 4070. Putting it a little slower than 4070ti but faster than 4070S.,Positive
Intel,"""4100 Performance!""",Neutral
Intel,"It doesnt change the fact that the 4070S was already sold. Nvidia already got their money from that unit. Selling your 4070S DOESNT RETURN what you already gave to nvidia's pockets lol.  You can think of it as **paying for someone** else to get a 4070S.  That is the thing that people like dude above is missing.  In the end, you just sacrificed your own experience for nothing. Its a ***Lose Win*** situation.  I aint gonna be stupid to sabotage myself just for a temporary feeling of being right and morally superior, a feeling that I did the right thing, because in the end, its inconsequential, and I just fucked myself in the process, and what is waiting for me in the end is just regret lol.  You might as well ***keep*** the 4070S, keep the better perf, software, efficiency etc etc and ***just focus on preaching*** to people to buy Intel GPUs (assuming its good value). ***Thats a win win scenario.***  Also, you dont want to mindlessly give Intel your own money. You want them to earn it. Buy Intel GPUs not because you want a 3rd player, but because you know its a good product and helping out a 3rd player in the GPU market is just a nice bonus.  If Intel half assess the B770's pricing and launch, and you still bought it just ""to support the underdog"", you are just incentivizing Intel to continue half assing their approach",Negative
Intel,"Damn I was thinking mobile, those are like 10-15 percent",Negative
Intel,"Private profile, shilling. Jog on buddy, no one knows what the card will be like.",Neutral
Intel,"You keep repeating the idea that “the 4070S was already sold, so nothing changes,” which tells me you’re stuck in the sunk cost fallacy. Nvidia getting money from the original sale is irrelevant to the next decision. What matters in economics is marginal demand. When someone sells their 4070S and chooses Intel for their next GPU, they remove one potential new Nvidia sale (the buyer of the used card may otherwise have purchased new) and simultaneously create one new Intel sale. Those marginal shifts are exactly how incumbents lose revenue and challengers gain market share. Sunk revenue doesn’t grant Nvidia permanent immunity from switching behavior.  A strong second hand market absolutely hurts Nvidia’s future sales. It lowers the effective cost of GPU ownership, pushes price sensitive buyers into used units instead of new ones, and reduces Nvidia’s pricing power. This is standard industrial organization theory used goods cannibalize new goods. Selling the 4070S does not “give Nvidia money,” it gives someone else a path to avoid paying Nvidia at all. Then replacing that card with Intel means Intel gets fresh revenue while Nvidia gets zero. Combine both actions and the net effect is Nvidia loses one new sale, Intel gains one new sale. That is the literal mechanism by which competition grows.  And pretending that “one person doesn’t matter” ignores how collective marginal actions scale. If even a small percentage of consumers switch from buying new Nvidia cards (~€600 on average) to Intel instead, the foregone revenue becomes massive. For example, 100,000 people doing this is €60 million Nvidia doesn’t get and €60 million Intel gains. That’s not “inconsequential”, that’s enough to change pricing strategy, product roadmaps, and R&D priorities. Markets don’t change because one individual defects they change when many individuals do, and that only happens if people stop rationalizing inaction with the sunk cost excuses you’re using.  Your whole argument hinges on a single transaction worldview, as if each GPU purchase is isolated. But the GPU market is dynamic. Nvidia’s future behavior depends on demand elasticity, competitors’ traction, and consumer switching. Selling your Nvidia card and buying Intel is a strategic choice that weakens incumbent dominance, strengthens pricing competition, and signals that alternatives are viable. Yes, you shouldn’t blindly buy Intel if the product is bad but when Intel is competitive, shifting demand is exactly how you incentivize innovation and better pricing across the board. In other words you don’t “sacrifice yourself,” you just refuse to keep subsidizing the monopoly.  In short, your logic collapses because you ignore marginal effects, second hand market cannibalization, collective action, and basic microeconomics. The 4070S sale is sunk the choice of what you buy next is what actually shapes the market.",Negative
Intel,"So what does a private profile got to do with it?  Or did you just ignore all my points.     The fact that said the word ""shilling"" is clear indicator you didnt understand what I said.  Did you want to go full Ad Hominem Fallacy by using my own profile against me while not doing anything with my statements LOL?",Negative
Intel,"Give it time and that guy will switch it up and come back with ""consumers don't matter anymore to Nvidia, only data center"". These corporate bootlickers are very narrow minded.",Negative
Intel,"The fundamental point you have is that a hypothetical card will be worse than the 4070 super, which is silly to say because we just don't know.",Negative
Intel,"Which still doesnt change the fact that itll be less efficienct and have weaker software. The 4070S draws 220W, and has access to a multitude of features at far greater availability and support, that is Nvidia's biggest strength that even AMD stans wont deny.  It still doesnt change the fact that you already gave money to Nvidia.  You could use your own statement against OP and yourself. Why would you sell your GPU when we dont even know how good it is? Lol. You are dumping a good card for an unknown one.  And I already said the following:  >You might as well ***keep*** the 4070S, keep the better perf, software, efficiency etc etc and ***just focus on preaching*** to people to buy Intel GPUs (assuming its good value). ***Thats a win win scenario.***  >You will be of bigger help by just keeping your 4070S and instead recommending Intel GPUs to your friends and other people who want to build a new PC (assuming Intel nails the pricing right). Spread the word instead, and dont sabotage yourself.  Tell me, wheres the shilling here?",Neutral
Intel,"With that price point if you live nearby a microcenter you can swing by there and grab the 7600X3D combo with the MSI B850 motherboard and 1 stick of 16GB DDR5 Gskill Flare Ram, Zotac RTX 5070 Solid, and an air cooler if your choice for about $950 before tax. When Ram prices drop back down in the future you can always go back and grab another 16GB Gskill DDR5 6000 CL36 Gskill Flare X5 single stick to run in dual channel with what you have.",Neutral
Intel,"Micro centers got great bundles on a 7800x3d along with an am5 b650 gen mobo or option to upgrade to x870, along with 32gb of DDR5 for about $600.   This’ll leave you a bit limited on a gpu if that’s your budget though. 5060 may bottleneck, 5070 would be ideal however if you can stretch budget to $1100-1150",Positive
Intel,are you buying in the US?,Neutral
Intel,Nah he said he's in Canada in the post,Neutral
Intel,"The Radeon RX 9060 XT offers the highest raw frame rates at 1080p, outperforming the competition by roughly 4-5% on average.  The RTX 5060 provides nearly identical performance but adds the advantage of DLSS 4 for superior upscaling and image quality.  While the Intel Arc B580 is the slowest card, its 12 GB of VRAM allows it to handle Ultra settings that cause the 8 GB cards to stutter.  Ultimately, the video recommends the 16 GB version of the RX 9060 XT as the best long-term choice for modern gaming.",Positive
Intel,Had to sell the 6600 XT and went for the 9060 XT 16GB to play at 1440p. I’m loving it,Neutral
Intel,I got my 8GB 5060Ti open box excellent BestBuy for $309. It was brand new.,Positive
Intel,Personally out of the 3 I'd pick the 5060. Transformer model is but better than FSR4 at 1080p,Positive
Intel,"Bought a 9060XT 8GB for 247e (renewed on Amazon, Black Friday stuff) and sold the temporary 4060 non-TI 8GB for 220e on marketplace. Good deal...",Positive
Intel,Only compares 8GB cards from teams red and green since it’s only considering <$300.,Neutral
Intel,"I feel like the HUB guys are going too hard with their VRAM crusade. Why recommend a GPU that's slower now just because it might be faster in the future?   A slight downgrade in render resolution or texture quality is hardly even noticeable, and with looming shortages I feel like most studios are going to start optimizing for lower VRAM further reducing the long term disadvantage of 8GB GPUs.",Negative
Intel,"The real answer, buy a used 2080ti. Usable VRAM, DLSS4, it still is 250W so it can run on most PSUs.  It is the most balanced option if you can't afford a 9060XT 16GB.",Positive
Intel,"all of them are power hungry junk, where are good cards?",Positive
Intel,real hero here,Negative
Intel,"The 5060 will crush, without less than a 40 percent difference, from dlls alone. Then add frame gen. WOW I can't believe you can get away with this.",Positive
Intel,5060 then cuz way better in AI  5% performance cut to gain 2x-3x AI speed,Positive
Intel,What processor are you using with 9060 xt?  Is it the same as you were using with 6600 xt?,Neutral
Intel,"Can you tell me how well it runs games at 1440p? Have you played some of the demanding ones like Black Myth Wukong, Stalker 2, etc? Do you play at medium? high? I assume FSR is always on.   And also what's your target FPS? Would really appreciate the feedback, because I have the same card and I'm thinking on switching to 1440p but I don't know what monitor would be good refreshrate-wise",Neutral
Intel,"Well yeah, the cheapest RX 9060 XT 16GB is [$380](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/video-card/#c=596&sort=price&page=1&P=11811160064,51539607552) and the cheapest RTX 5060 TI 16GB is [$430](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/video-card/#sort=price&P=11811160064,51539607552&c=593). When you're comparing $300 GPUs, you're not going to bring up a GPU that's nearly another hundred dollar.",Neutral
Intel,"That would be a completely new phenomenon if you look at the past. Sure, some (probably indie) studio will optimize their games, but they would have done so already because they care about their customers.  Nothing will change with the current devs or tech, it's just a temporary issue that memory is that expensive. The prices will be lower in 2027, or we'll get used to it and buy more expensive stuff.",Neutral
Intel,"6 ish year old product that is out of warranty from some rando, is not exactly comparable here and definitely not a ""real answer""",Negative
Intel,"Dunno why you're being downvoted, the 2080 Ti is still very good value for the price and often has good OC headroom. Beats 5060 in most cases and you're right about 11GB being decent",Positive

Intel,you tell us,Neutral
Intel,Why do power requirements matter?   Electricity costs pennies,Neutral
Intel,AMD cards have upscaling and framegen as well...,Neutral
Intel,"Can you elaborate what do you mean by ""AI speed""?",Neutral
Intel,No. Dlss and frame gen is much less impactful in terms of performance boost at the low end and the latency is more noticeable. It’s also half the vram.,Neutral
Intel,WOW 25 so far for the TRUTH. HUB and fooling now.,Positive
Intel,"Yes, same processor, 5600x",Neutral
Intel,"yeah seriously, here b580 is noticably cheaper for example.",Negative
Intel,"Yeah, I just wanted to point it out because there’s people like me to whom prices in dollars means nothing (or who don’t read the title) and then waste time watching an irrelevant video (though I skipped to the conclusion so not that much time).🙂",Negative
Intel,"Point being? If a cap blows because it's old any repair shop can fix it, If it's a fan dying you can fix that yourself.  On the other side there's not much the warranty can do for running out of VRAM.",Negative
Intel,"In this economy? It doesn't make any sense to not keep perfectly usable hardware that does the job just fine out of a landfill.   A 2080ti or a 3070 or AMD equal is more than enough performance for most people. Easily, and is way better bang for your buck.",Neutral

Intel,nothing global about it,Negative
Intel,"So you prefer low power for lower heat and smaller size.   I'm not space conscious, so those things don't matter.   What's with messy cables? The PC sits under the table, so it also doesn't matter how ugly it is.",Negative
Intel,"Well actually people have been modding games to put FSR where neither AMD or NVIDIA added official support.   Pretty much every game had amd nvidia and even intel upscaling these days.   In fact, when i still had my 3080ti, i was able to use AMD’s framegen in many games (cyberpunk, dying light, talos principle) because NVIDIA didnt provide any option for 3000 series.   I still bought nvidia because amd doesnt offer any cards at 5080 level, so no brainwashing here. You’re completely uneducated blinded by consumerism",Neutral

I use it because then I can lock my fps to 120 (on a 4K OLED TV) and use enhanced sync instead of Vsync because of the screen tearing when locking to 120. Now I have to do the frame lock to 117 which is fine but just annoying me I'm missing out on 3 fps lol it was causing issues in a few games where it would stutter like crazy and it all came down to enhanced sync.

Intel,"I think Linux developers are doing some experiments As of now, FSR 4 (FidelityFX Super Resolution 4) does not officially support RDNA 2 or RDNA 3 GPUs, even on Linux.

That isn't to say they won't do it, but right now it's not been announced.

Here's the moment before it crashes to a black screen:  [afterburner screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/3YpJFtzM/Screenshot-2025-12-21-030537.png)  The dip in clocks is the moment it crashes. As you can see, it is running well above boost clocks. Hence, freezing in a few minutes, proceeded by a black screen, and a crash. The ups and downs are from me alt tabbing in the graphs, by  the way.   This is with core clock -200mhz applied in Afterburner and no crashes, boosts to just above declared boost clocks. Here the dips in up and down on power are probably me toying around how much exactly -mhz is needed.

Intel,"there won't be an ""fsr 5"" because any game with fsr implemented from here on out should, in theory, be compatible with every future version of fsr made, so numbering them isn't as meaningful. they're probably just going to stick with unofficial codenames like redstone for diffrentiation.

It's just whether AMD wants to formally spread those branches out on a file / compilation level and distribute different packages. And then publicly whether they commit to updating all branches of code or only some.  For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch. Of course, we have very little outside insight into the exact spread of these cases that AMD wants to pay their engineers to work on.",Neutral

Intel,"Most likely when your distro provides a kernel update.  I'd give this a quick read: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-update-and-see-what-graphics-driver-you-have-on-linux-and-steamos/  Pretty much the default is that you will be using the Mesa driver collection and they were last updated yesterday.  The fixes there do not correlate with the ones in this thread (I think).  As long as you are on a ""cutting edge"" type distro then you can expect that update in the next few days/weeks.  If you are on a ""stable"" distro that doesn't update often, you may be waiting a realllly long time.",Neutral
Intel,"Get what exactly? Features? Bug fixes? Optimizations?   Every 2 weeks there are new Mesa driver updates with bug fixes and performance optimizations. As for features, you have to wait a few months for versions with big numbers (25.2 is soon updating to 25.3, adding Anti-lag 2).   Depending on your distribution, you can get these updates faster or slower.",Neutral

Sometimes I can play for hours on end, other time game just crashes randomly after 10-15 minutes.  I am going to try to downgrade to 25.9.1 and see how it fares, since I remember that driver being really stable for me (6800XT).  Edit: been playing for 4 hours, no crash yet.

Intel,"Weird. I was running 10.2 and things were running fine for the most part. I kept getting a pop-up on launch saying there was a known issue with that driver and Arc Raiders though, so I rolled it back to 9.2 and had more issues on that release than the one with the stated problems.

It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.

Intel,"I totally understand. if you're running with an affected display config, you should be fine on 25.9.1 or the 25.10.1 preview driver for BF6. We'll get this out as soon as we can.",Neutral
Intel,"Appreciate you reaching out with this - that's an interesting data point to consider.  In this case, the quirky behaviour with HDMI 2.1 + FRL was attributed to a change made in the display stack, I don't think it explicitly involves display stream compression to repro, just high enough display bandwidth (though I could be mistaken)",Positive
Intel,"Interesting. I've been experiencing random BSODs on my PC too on a fresh Win11 install too, I was also suspecting it was something to do with auto HDR toggle but I didn't know for sure.  I'm running 180hz 1440 LG panel but I don't recall if it's using hdmi or DP. I've also never experienced BSODs until the last week or two, since i did a fresh install and I've had the same monitors/PCs for a long time.",Neutral
Intel,Don't apologise - this one is worth getting upset over. Hope it's fixed for you all very soon.,Negative
Intel,Was yours the DisplayPort config or HDMI? I may have a fix for this ready if you're available test,Neutral
Intel,Can you provide me some context? Are there any posts detailing the issue either here or at the chromium project side?,Neutral
Intel,Already launched in COD 7,Neutral
Intel,"Im currently using dp 1.4 on my 7900 gre.  My monitor has 2.1 hdmi, so you’re saying i shoulf switch to hdmi?",Neutral
Intel,Some of us are using DP 2.1 though. DP 1.4 is a thing of the past.,Neutral
Intel,Are you sure? The steam machine has HDMI 2.0 and DP 1.4 listed in the specifications,Neutral
Intel,"Ah ok, that definitely makes sense if you're using a TV. Hope they straighten it out for you soon.",Neutral
Intel,What I did is get the 25.8.1 drivers shut off the fluid motion frames and in Windows set bf6 to run full power on your graphics card. Try some of those things and see if that helps you.,Neutral
Intel,"I tried to reinstall the chipset drivers, the same error, tried to install the drivers from gigabyte site the second screen worked but uninstalled adrenaline and it ran the auto update that disabled the secondary screen and the issue of no adrenaline opening came back, going back to older version, thanks AMD",Neutral
Intel,With the compiled leaked DLL you can use it on RDNA3 as well.,Neutral
Intel,"Wait until December, there's the 5th anniversary and they'll supposedly drop something new.",Neutral
Intel,For me playing it with path tracing on eventually the game crashes. Had no issues playing with ray tracing: psycho though.,Negative
Intel,Amen to that. Not a single crash since the game released on CachyOS. (9070 XT),Negative
Intel,Thank you! Exciting keen to see what it’s like,Positive
Intel,"It has nothing to do with the lack of vulkan support, even when fsr4 comes to vulkan, the game still needs ray regeneration implementation from the devs, you cant use optiscaler through dlss inputs, like you probably will be able to in fx alan wake 2",Negative
Intel,I suppose is going to be fixed as soon as Amd Redstone go out. Basically is going to add every tecnology that Path tracing needs to work. Off course the devs would have to implement them in the game too,Neutral
Intel,"The issue is if you try to use path tracing. Which to be fair, you probably shouldn't unless the miracle of them getting Virtuous to implement Ray Regeneration in Cyberpunk happens.",Negative
Intel,yes i tried it ... maybe it is because of the 7800X3D ... i really dont know... i will wait for the next patch ... should come tomorrow 18.11. ... but i have read so many threads and i am not the only one...,Neutral
Intel,Hmm fair. For me on 9070XT if I had raytracing enabled it would crash most regularly on loading back to the menu after extraction which was annoying but at least not game destroying lol. But yeah annoying enough that I turned RT off entirely.   I hope this means I can turn it back on because the game runs well enough for it.,Negative
Intel,"Yes. So far, so good. I'm not 100% sure what fixed it.      I uninstalled both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master standalone applications. Deleted the ""amdryzenmasterv"" keys. Rebooted.  Then I installed Adrenalin and used the Ryzen Master installer in Adrenalin (Performance > Metrics > Install Ryzen Master).  I think this problem might have something to do with a handshake breaking between Ryzen Master and Adrenalin, after upgrading just Adrenalin.   From now on, I'll probably do clean installs, removing and reinstalling both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master, through Adrenalin Performance tab.",Positive
Intel,"My last two processors are ryzen amd, my last three video cards are amd radeon and next one will be amd also, nvidia has driver issues as well, to be honest.  But yes, some issues are too annoying and updating drivers is lottery at this point. I would advice against updating drivers unless you need it for specific new game or have the latest video cards - rx 9070 \[xt\]  or 9060 xt .  I should have sold the 7700 xt and bought 9060 xt 16gb instead but too late for that now and it has problems as well, so lottery as i said, its a risk.",Negative
Intel,"I see, btw I'm just telling the natural AMD trends on its major update/features on its GPU (kinda). Wish it coming sooner..",Neutral

Intel,Could be grounds for lawsuit… That’s funny!,Neutral
Intel,Because of MPO.,Negative
Intel,yeah same with 25.11.1 25.9.2 works for me,Positive
Intel,"25.10.2 was the previous WHQL, so also yes :P",Neutral
Intel,"Huh, seems to be running in DX12 for me, as reported by MSI AB, and FSR4 is working",Neutral
Intel,Which driver version and does it still crashing?,Neutral
Intel,OK I will install it now and test it and get back to you. Give me 10 mins.,Neutral
Intel,Yuppp. It does not work on bf6 but it works on ark survival ascended for me. Seems it might be a bf issue. I saw ppl saying they were getting more fps with this driver in BF6 but I think they didn't realize it's using FSR 3.1 and not 4.,Negative
Intel,I'll work with the engineer from that ticket check if that issue has somehow regressed.,Neutral
Intel,We've not been able to reproduce this internally so far. Can you remind me which GPU (was this a 7900XTX?) + connectivity method you're using?,Neutral
Intel,Try using DDU to uninstall your current drivers and do a clean install of the 25.10.2 combined drivers if you havent already (you can find it here):  https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-25-10-2.html,Neutral
Intel,"Yup just need to say ""No""",Neutral
Intel,"whew thanks, good think i noticed it first before updating. i have 25.10.2 and 25.9.2 here and they both have windows 10 along their filename so i might as well asked.",Positive
Intel,I don't see how it would work on 23.9.1 lol,Neutral
Intel,"Did you use DDU to uninstall the drivers and then reinstall using a driver installer from the AMD website? I found this guide yesterday and it was extremely helpful, specifically step 8:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1lnxb8o/ultimate_amd_performance_fix_guide_stop_lag_fps/",Neutral
Intel,I did it this morning before the new driver and confirm chipset drivers were untouched,Neutral
Intel,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.  More people use HDMI than what people think and those TVs don’t always have a DP connector at all.,Negative
Intel,"ah, that explains it. Thanks. :)",Positive
Intel,"What if one does not check release notes? V25.10.2 point to different packages, for installing both CPU and GPU you had to download the AutoDetect package (named “minimal install”). Obviously I’m referring to AMD driver download page.",Neutral
Intel,"Okay, as long as they have a workaround for that... I was planning to get a 9060XT, but also keep my 6700XT for lossless scaling frame gen, was worried the branching would affect that..",Neutral
Intel,"What a mess. I have rdna2 and 3 on the same PC, so combined driver is the solution for this? Or auto detect is the only way?",Negative
Intel,"Damn, that's a huge relief to hear. Most of the frustration came from not knowing whether the issue was even acknowledged.   Thanks a lot for the update.",Negative
Intel,What about Noise Suppression not working since 25.9.2?,Negative
Intel,Finally. The last driver without pink artifacting was 25.4.1  It has been 7 months. AMD Matt acknowledged the bug on [the amd forums](https://pcforum.amd.com/s/question/0D5KZ000011WpJJ0A0/pink-square-artifacting-chrome-discord-and-steam) 5 months ago.  Please let it be fixed with the next driver update. So many 7000series users are on the verge of swapping to Nvidia.  https://i.redd.it/ywrg9at3lp1g1.gif,Neutral
Intel,"what about whatever changed post 25.3.1 for multi monitors? Any driver 25.3.1 and older i can run my main at 200hz, my side at 165, and my third at 60 without issue. Any driver newer than 25.3.1 and running my main at 200hz then playing a game will cause the second monitor (165hz) to flicker, glitch, and freak out the entire time, until the game on the main monitor is closed. Dropping to 165 on the main monitor down from 200hz \*fixes\* the issue but, i paid for 200hz and would like to be able to actually use it again.  (7700xt system)",Neutral
Intel,Hell yeah 🙂 amd I appreciate you see the issues Iv been a fan boy for a long time and I know it will be fixed,Positive
Intel,"Hi. Sorry, I thought this was pretty common as I've had this issue with two different systems and 3 AMD GPUs across 2 generations. [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1jayump/chrome_full_screen_freezes_after_switching_to_amd/) [Or here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/3890720/parts-of-screen-freezes-when-using-chrome) Chrome (or other Chromium browsers, I've had this happen with Edge too) in fullscreen, with graphics acceleration enabled.   Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind this only actually matters if one protocol or the other is **actually** limiting bandwidth for the [resolution * FPS] you want to display on your monitor  For instance, DP 1.4 can do ~25Gbits/s, which translates to roughly 1440p @ 240fps, or 4k @ 120fps  If you have proper cable into HDMI 2.1, it should be able to do ~42Gbits/s, which would instead be 4k @ 190fps  Read up the wikipedia tables for bandwidth specs and resolution / fps / bit depth rates for more",Neutral
Intel,Yeah most people are still have dp 1.4 monitors though. No way I'm swapping my monitor just for dp 2.1 as it's just too awesome. Although these tandem OLED screens look interesting... Hmm lol,Positive
Intel,"lol, listened too much to linus  https://youtu.be/g3FkuZNSGkw?t=261",Neutral
Intel,That was my very first actual driver issue I experienced with AMD.,Negative
Intel,Oh that's nice! I'll look into it when I get the chance.,Positive
Intel,Cool. Thank you,Positive
Intel,I might turn on ray tracing in like a medium or low setting just for shits and giggles or screenshots but I don't plan on playing with it on all the time since I'll also play at 1440p so I don't wanna have a really bad experience 😖,Negative
Intel,Exactly! It's insane. I can't believe running through a translation layer is more stable than running native,Negative
Intel,"but i dont know something is also wrong with 25.11.1 ... AMD Adrenalin randomly vanishes from tray     i dont want to roll back to 25.9.1 :-(    but this version was the last which was good so far      maybe when we have luck amd is able to provide next time a ""perfect"" driver without any issues?",Negative
Intel,"Could be it, nothing hardware wise at all and just software too.     Yeah, you're not the 1st I've read that says they have issues on the game.     If you're crashing and the system reboots it does make me think of some stability issues and not really just GPU, but I'm guessing you've already tried stability tests and using the system without OC+A-XMP/EXPO disabled.     Once upon a time I remember reading some people, on other instances and other games, having crashes like that (complete reboot) due to PSU instability as well.     Good luck!",Neutral
Intel,That's strange. My game defaulted to everything maxed out including running ray tracing and I haven't noticed any issues. The game runs incredibly well.  I've got a 5800X3D & 9070XT as well.,Positive
Intel,"Fair enough, and yeah sooner the better for all of us",Positive
Intel,It absolutely could be.  Europe has some pretty good consumer law and promising features that could impact your purchase decision are part of this law.  It can fall under misleading advertisement,Neutral
Intel,"It's not freezing, it's just that the GPU usage is practically at 100% all the time, even with V-Sync enabled. With the 25.9 drivers, this doesn't happen, and the clock speed varies normally, increasing and decreasing as needed when V-Sync is enabled. These 25.10 drivers are causing the GPU to consume more energy unnecessarily.",Neutral
Intel,Fingers crossed,Neutral
Intel,"Thanks for attempting to retest.  It's a 7900XTX with an Index connected via DisplayPort. I am on the latest 25.11.1 driver.  I run a monitor at 4k 120Hz 10bpc with HDR Off, which uses DSC, as my main and only display. I tried disabling DSC in the monitor settings which runs at 4k 120Hz 8bpc with HDR Off but I don't think I noticed a change in latency. I thought that DSC on and off on two different devices might contribute to the problem but I'm not sure.   I have also tried running the Index under a RX480 on another PC and I fairly certain the latency looks different under 90Hz and looks similar under 120Hz. Can't play much to test though as an RX480 runs the Index at a very blurry setting. Getting around to doing this test is what took me so long to reply.",Neutral
Intel,Were you able to find the issue?,Neutral
Intel,"Allright ty, will Install new, any differences in performance?",Neutral
Intel,"im running 25.11.1 on win10 7900xt. no problems besides afmf2 breaking the performance overlay, which ive had for multiple updates now",Neutral
Intel,I don't think you understand what I mean.. If you downgrade to that you can get fsr 4 to work on 6000 series without having to change any files.,Neutral
Intel,Thank you for this. This was very helpful. Got adrenaline working fine now.,Positive
Intel,"I wish my LG C4 42"" had a display port. Its my primary monitor.",Positive
Intel,"Yep, AMD is not so quick in fixing their driver download page, I still can remember when X870E chipset came out but you found only X670 option. The drivers were the same, but man it’s your flagship chipset! Anyway, drivers install but Adrenalin App does not work for me… and have zero time to reinstall Windows.",Negative

Intel,"I feel like AMD can do a bit of a better job communicating this, despite Vik's great efforts in this subreddit. Just saying: hey guys, we know about this, it sucks, bear with us please can make things better in the long run in my opinion.",Positive
Intel,"We've not observed anything like this internally, and I've personally not seen this at all in the field. This one may be specific to your display combination. I'll talk to a colleague in our display team about what we can do to learn more about that behaviour on your side - we might ask you to capture a special kind of log file during a state when your secondary display is blanking with gameplay on the primary",Neutral
Intel,Can you tell us what content you have on the secondary panel when it starts misbehaving? Is this behaviour affected if you disable VRR on it too?,Neutral
Intel,"I see. I recall the partial display freeze being related to DWM & multi plane overlay in Windows. One of our community testers encountered this and remedied with the overlayminFPS DWORD here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/1kgp7ar/cause_and_solution_to_windows_24h2_related/?sort=new  If you're getting TDRs, with chome(ium) + gameplay, pass us over a kernel memory dmp and we'll take a look into it",Neutral

Intel,"They are TV's, not pc monitors. Buy the right tool for the job",Neutral
Intel,"I couldn't find the DWM key so I made one, we'll see if that fixes it. Thank you for replying. But please, forward it to someone. There must be people out there on AMD hardware that are not tech savvy and this just breeds bad reputation.",Neutral

Intel,"Yeah, I'm facing the same issue on RX 9060 XT   Is it a GPU driver issue, or a Windows issue that Microsoft needs to fix?",Negative
Intel,since last BF6 Update i had zero crashes also on 25.11.1,Negative
Intel,"That's not how it works. Small print won't save you from stuff like this, you think that they can stop releasing this software for 2-3 years because some small print said 'Subject to change'?   European consumer law would absolutely support the consumer in this case. If you promise a feature by a certain date, you will need to deliver it. If the development takes way too long, you are in for a ride",Negative

Intel,"Works in Windows too. But Windows has way too much overhead for all of the AI garbage, ads and integrated spyware running in the background to still be a usable operating system. Linux is much better.   The drivers install all side-by-side, and all GPUs show up as OpenCL devices. In the software you can then select which one to run on.   FluidX3D can select multiple OpenCL devices at once, each holding only one part of the simulation box in its VRAM. So VRAM of the GPUs is pooled together, with communication happening over PCIe.",Neutral

DirectX I think is controlled by the Graphics settings in Control Panel. I think there's a page somewhere that lets you pick the GPU. That might be a Windows 11 thing though.

It only renders its own domain, at 3D offset, to its own frame with accompanying z-buffer, and copies those to CPU over PCIe. The CPU then overlays the frames.",Neutral

Intel,"god i wish.   that menu is entirely useless, the only options are power saving / high performance, which are all forcibly autoselected to the same gpu.  please tell me that the windows 11 version actually lets you manually select what specific gpu you want via a dropdown menu?",Negative
Intel,"lets be honest, this is the REAL reason intel getting into graphics is a wonderful thing.",Negative
Intel,Thank you so much for the very detailed response!,Positive
Intel,Well worth it!,Positive
Intel,Thank you my man!! Looking forward to run some tests once I get home.,Positive
Intel,That's awesome!,Positive
Intel,"Yes, but SLI is a bad description for it.",Negative
Intel,"The faster PCIe 4.0/5.0 and future iterations mean that dedicated SLI/Crossfire bridges are obsolete. The PCIe bandwidth nowadays is more than enough. And PCIe is the generic industry standard interface, easier to program for than proprietary hardware that's different for every vendor.   For games multi-GPU is gone for good (too few users, too large cost of development, no return of investment for game Studios). But in simulation/HPC/AI software multi-GPU is very common as it allows to go beyond the VRAM capacity of a single large GPU for cheaper.",Neutral
Intel,"sli/crossfire were killed for good reason, its just a bad time all around if half of your gpu's core/cache is located a foot away from the other half, unless your baseline performance is so damn low that the microstutters just get lost in the noise.  ultimately chiplet cpu/gpu designs are basically just an evolved form of sli/crossfire, and we're happily starting to get quite good at those.  (assuming we're talking about games)",Negative
Intel,"indeed it did, if only game devs adopted this more. Then again, the idea of two high end GPUs like we have today in a single PC is kinda horrifying.",Negative
Intel,"There is not really a clear limit. More PCIe bandwidth makes scaling efficiency better, less means the software will run a bit slower in multi-GPU mode. 3.0 x4 (~3.3GB/s) is just enough for reasonable efficiency.",Neutral
Intel,"It does actually. I have 3 gpus i can select from (7900 XT, iGPU, and Tesla P4)   Ill reply to your message once i get a screenshot",Neutral
Intel,"NVLink 3.0 (2020, GTX3090 use this one for reference) is a tiny bit faster than PCIe 5.0 (16x, 2019) : 50GT/s vs 32GT/s  But PCIe 6.0 is faster nvlink 4.0 but not 5.0 (those are only use in DC GPU AFAIK)  [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVLink)",Neutral
Intel,"Indeed, people forget that the speeds electricity travels is slow in the computer world.   Kinda why the RAM slot closer to your CPU performs so good. And why benchmarkers will use that slot, and not the one furthest from the CPU.  Same with NVME m2 SSD, the closest slot is the best one. PC will perform the best if OS is located on the closest one.   Much better off just slapping two GPUs together in a single form factor than two separate GPUs.  Guess that is why we have 5090 these days. At about double the price of the old flagships.    You can view that as SLI i guess :P",Neutral
Intel,"Iirc Rise and Shadow of the Tomb Raider were the only games to support the used of mixed multi GPU (at least mainstream) other than ashes. A bit of a bummer from goofy multi GPU setups, but yeah, today the thought of two 600 watt GPUs in a single system just sounds like a recipe for disaster. With an overclocked CPU, an intense game could literally trip a 120v breaker!",Neutral
Intel,"thanks man.  that is incredibly relieving to hear, and equally annoying considering this is probably going to be the reason ill eventually 'upgrade' to win 11 one of these decades.  cant believe internet stories of a functional fucking menu is more enticing to me than the actual trillion dollar marketing...  ​​​  also this is a bit of a dumb question but can you actually play games on gpu-1 if the monitor is connected to gpu-2?  i'd assume so considering thats basically what laptops do, but... im done assuming that things work without issue.",Positive
Intel,"Yes i can do games on 1, but using monitor on 2. I have one monitor connected to the gpu itself, and the other to the motherboard, since my card only has 1 hdmi port which i use for vr",Neutral
Intel,Why are you connecting the monitor to the gpu and not the mobo?,Neutral

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative
Intel,One thing I appreciate about AMD is having the lowest CPU overhead for their graphics drivers. Makes a difference if you're CPU limited in a game.,Neutral
Intel,So Nvidia now has the lowest driver overhead? Seems like they took the HUB video seriously,Neutral
Intel,So the money you save on a GPU you will need to spend on a better CPU??  Might as well get a faster GPU.,Negative
Intel,Interesting that B580 doesn't look bad at all with a 13600k. I wonder what it's like with a 13400 or 12600k. It seems like just having those extra threads provided by the e-cores takes care of the overhead it needs.,Positive
Intel,"Unless you're running a CPU that's *many* many years old, GPU overhead is not really something you need to worry about. Whether AMD has less overhead or Nvidia has less, it really doesn't matter.",Neutral
Intel,"On an older post an Intel graphics engineer explained the issue, it isn't what you said. Intel is too verbose in commands which slows everything down.",Negative
Intel,I'm fairly sure they use dxvk for d3d9 to 11.,Neutral
Intel,Could just be a cache issue,Neutral
Intel,Battlemage drivers use the cpu for software accelerating certain processes that are not being hardware accelerated in the GPU.,Neutral
Intel,Glad you brought up Nvidia as I didn’t know this had improved until the testing around Arc showed it had gone.,Positive
Intel,"According to the graphs, AMD has slightly less overhead than NVIDIA.",Neutral
Intel,"No, they do not.  The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software.  They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  The main example that seems to suggest otherwise is actually a demonstration of nVidia's forced threading of DX11 games, which can increase performance despite the increased overhead it entails, when the CPU has enough headroom overall (i.e. it doesn't eat into the single-thread performance).",Negative
Intel,"Lowest with DX11 and older, but not with the newer APIs",Neutral
Intel,And when is the last time HUB did a dedicated video showing the improvement in overhead?,Neutral
Intel,or it's just a cache/memory access issue,Neutral
Intel,"The overhead is minimal for both AMD GPUs and NVIDIA GPUs, which is probably why reviewers didn't look at the overhead until Intel GPUs came along.",Neutral
Intel,"> Unless you're running a CPU that's many many years old, GPU overhead is not really something you need to worry about.   That's just not true with Battlemage.  CPUs released in 2024 showed the issue in testing.    It's not year of release, it's capabilities.",Negative
Intel,"Intel uses software translation for DX11 and lower, so it does matter for them.",Neutral
Intel,"Hmm, Nvidia lost less performance going from 14900k to 13600k than AMD but more when going down to 12100",Neutral
Intel,"> No, they do not. The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software. They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  This was true for Alchemist but not for Battlemage.",Negative
Intel,That's not true. Intel's issue is being too verbose in commands/calls.,Negative
Intel,"Never, because HUB doesn't like portraying Nvidia in any light besides negative.",Negative
Intel,HUB used DX12 games that also showed the issue.  It's something else.,Neutral
Intel,"The comment to which I am replying is talking about nVidia, not Intel.",Neutral
Intel,"I’m pretty sure HUB doesn’t like Nvidia *or* AMD. They’re calling it how it is, these parts are too damn expensive.",Negative
Intel,That's actually... just worse news.,Negative
Intel,I always dreamt of the day APUs become power houses.,Neutral
Intel,"Is it my expectations being too high or this ain't a huge uplift? To go back to the classic: hopefully Zen 6 with RDNA 4 will offer a bigger uplift. We only have to wait a year and a half...  Anyway, question for the more knowledgeable people: how could the 890M perform with a 50W chip variant, but with 5600 SO-DIMM RAM? What to expect?",Neutral
Intel,"I find it sad that most review outlet is not testing CCX latency for these new CPUs.  These Zen 5 + Zen 5c have insanely high cross CCX latency, 180ms tested by geekerwan to be exact. For reference the 5950x had a 70ms latency for their cross ccd latency and the 4 ccd 1950x had a 150ms cross ccd latency with the closet 2 ccd and 200ms between the furthest 2.  Essentially games will be limited to the 5.1ghz peak 4 core zen5 core cluster or the 3.3ghz peak 8 core zen5c core cluster.",Neutral
Intel,Damn Why is AMD even involved in iGPU,Negative
Intel,"If this is true, Strix Point is going to claim total dominance over the GTX 1650 market. Won't be until 2023 when the theoretical RTX 4050 is released to surpass Strix Point's efficiency. Then super budget-friendly Strix Halo will come next year and take the RTX 2080's lunch money. Game over Nvidia.",Positive
Intel,"Strix Halo is rumored to be a whopping 40 CUs of RDNA3.5 so...   That'll do it no sweat, if they release it.",Neutral
Intel,almost there,Neutral
Intel,"We're a ways off from that still. These Strix Point 890M results are comparable to 1/2 the performance of the RX 6600. That's only good enough for \~30 FPS in Assassins Creed Mirage at 1080p Max.  I think this will be great for non-gaming purposes, like Adobe, Autodesk and so on. 890M should be a photo editing powerhouse.",Positive
Intel,"I mean current consoles are already APU power houses, they can give you 120fps depending on the game, and 30-60fps depending on what mode you select. And these consoles are pretty power constrained and pared down compared to PCs. So this APU here could easily double the performance of a console.   That's tapping on 4070/7800 levels of performance.",Positive
Intel,Never gonna happen as long as they use DDR memory.  The only powerful APUs are those that use GDDR or HBM. See: every AMD-powered console and the MI300A.,Negative
Intel,"Radeon iGPUs are mostly limited by the shared RAM bandwidth. I was thinking of getting an 8700G a little while ago, and the benchmarks varied wildly depending on RAM frequency and overclocks.  Maybe they'll improve it by hooking it up to a wider GDDR bus in laptops, similar to how the current PS5 and Xboxes work (IIRC?)",Neutral
Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks. Intel is already moving on it and I think the main thing holding AMD back is that they rely on 3rd parties for memory packaging so the capacity goes to the more lucrative enterprise chips first.",Neutral
Intel,"The iGPU uplift is extremely underwhelming, I guess this is why Asus did the ROG Ally X model instead of waiting for these chips. I wouldnt be surprised if Lunar Lake with Xe2 passes Zen 5's iGPU at lower power levels, at higher ones im sure RNDA 3.5 will be ahead.",Neutral

Intel,7500mhz ram and the 780m,Neutral
Intel,"if you don't consider power, sure, but in that case you may as well go discrete. efficiency is a big reason for these AIO packages and on-package memory can prevent breaking the power budget while pushing higher bandwidth.",Neutral
Intel,"Indeed. Also the closer the memory is to the CPU, the higher the speeds, thus bandwidth. On-package memory will always be faster.",Neutral
Intel,"Have _you_ looked at the actual game benchmarks in the review? The Ally X (a low power handheld) is within 1fps of the bottom of the 890m laptops. It's 5-9fps to the very fastest (again a higher power laptop!!), all at 1080p high settings which i think should  be the target for this range of entries in the roundup.  There is nothing like a 40-60% uplift in those games and that very standard resolution? I was stoked for Strix Point myself but this is super underwhelming.",Neutral

Intel,"Based on the results, it seems like the next steam deck might be more than a year away. Not particularly impressive gains from the previous gen.",Negative
Intel,"It'll need to be a custom tooled APU like Aerith/Van Gogh if it is to take full advantage of the 890m.     Nearly all of the configs that release of 16cu Point APU or 40cu Halo will be an APU slapped in a chassis without an adequate power or memory bandwidth setup for the igpu.     What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra. Its desktop tower chip is behind the entry level mobile OS chip from its competitor. It is a decade behind the desktop chips of its competitor, itis hardly Monster class.",Neutral

And AMD ""can make"" such APUs -> PS5 Pro (as a more cost effective solution). AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative
Intel,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",Negative

Intel,I had an arc a750 as a placeholder until I got. A 6950xt and I love it so much. Except amd still hasn't fixed the ghost of tsushima issue other than that it's been phenomenal and I get over 60fps in almost every game at 4k,Positive
Intel,"Well one great thing you have to look forward to is amd is going all in on software. They already said FSR with AI is coming, and I have a feeling a lot more. We should be seeing some pretty cool software features coming out now that they have more employees for software",Positive

Intel,"I'm keeping my eye on Intel gpus, but I certainly won't be a first adopter. Honestly I'll be even more skeptical now with Intel's recent issues with 13/14 gen cpus.

If Intel can be competitive in the budget market it will at least put a fire under amd to lower their prices/make a better valued product.",Negative
Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't. Problems that Nvidia and AMD both solved decades ago that are holding Intel back in 2024.   It's not a mystery how a GPU should be built but that didn't stop Intel from not figuring it out.,Neutral

Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral

Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so?

It makes me wonder if they have used older drivers, since they don;t even get 60fps rasterized at 1080p in some games.  edit: And I paid much less than the minimum price they are listing, I'd need to check if prices went up - even though computer base suggest that isn't the case. The bigger problem still, but getting better, is that when it doesn't work it's really really terrible.",Positive
Intel,"Well I mean... I guess it depends on what you're wanting to do of course, but even my 12 GB card was struggling to do raytracing a couple years ago, so that claim isn't really far fetched.  My 20 GB card struggles to hit 60 fps with path tracing at 1440p",Negative

After years of battling AMD and failing, I made an ultimatum to our ceo and told him directly that I didn't want to support this anymore and that I'd leave if we didn't switch everything to Nvidia and I actually quit the company over this because the response was that it was impossible. 2 months later they sold all the AMD hardware at a fraction of the original price and managed to take a credit to switch everything to NVIDIA.  Somebody else even made a huge post here and on r/linux, phoronix covered it slightly and AMD went into full panic mode, their developer advocate came here and on AMD forums and in emails and made many grand promises. Here we are almost 10 years later, same issues still exist.  Oh yeah, and BlackMagic (DaVinci Resolve maker) today officially doesn't support their software on any AMD hardware.

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Intel,"And I'm over here struggling to keep an Nvidia T4 passthrough to work reliably on Hyper-V to Ubuntu 22.04. :(  Is there a specific software combination that works more reliably than others?   Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.

Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.  You're free to guess what vendor om looking at to replace my CPU with. Damn shame really.",Negative
Intel,"Fact: AMD does not give a shit about any of this.   We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line. If all CDNA customers switch to NVIDIA and those PO's dropped in volume, it might make them care a little bit.",Negative

Intel,"I’ve been buying ATI / AMD since the ATI Rage 128, and I think my next GPU will be Nvidia. I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

Also some other games having driver timeouts to, but i have games that also never timeout.

I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.  Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

Intel,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

Intel,"It's more that I don't want to reward a business for failing me.  If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Ive had a few hiccups that looked like driver issues that turned out to actually be Windows issues, and i always wonder if people are quick to blame AMD for issues because of what they have heard vs actually investigating and finding the real cause of the problem.

And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.

The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

I have been able to interact directly with the AMD support engineers they provide access to, and the support is severely lacking. These issues here have been reported on for over 5 years now, and what has AMD done for these clients?  Until I made my prior posts here on r/AMD, AMD were not interested or even awake when it came to these issues. I have had direct correspondence with John Bridgman where he confirmed that GPU reset was not even considered in prior generations.  Of what use are these support contracts and the high cost of buying these cards if AMD wont provide the resources to make them function in a reliable manner.  Why did it take some random (me) to have to publicly embarrass the company before we saw any action on bugs reported by their loyal paying enterprise clients?",Negative
Intel,">AMD is working with Amazon and Azure on systems with 1-4 GPUs supporting SR-IOV/MxGPU. This is only with ""Pro"" or ""Instinct"" cards though.  and MSFT, but we are not seeing these changes upstream via open standards. We still are lacking working support for the likes of Nutanix and Proxmox (both KVM), where Redhat has some support but there are still unresolved issues there.  Fact of it, the changes AMD is pushing at AWS would upstream to every other KVM install and bring those fixes to mainstream. But this has been going on for well over 6 years that I can recall and still we are no closer to a ODM solution released to the masses.

I would absolutely *love* to see 4K TV manufacturers offer DisplayPort in future TVs, but that's probably not happening anytime soon.   About Nova you're probably right. But please keep in mind, that its scope is much more narrow than any other open source driver out there. Mostly, it only serves as an adapter between the Linux kernel and GSP firmware. Current Noveau implementations reflect this: GSP features are easier to implement and thus currently more feature complete. And since there is an AI/Nvidia hype train at the moment, they will probably also dedicate more resources into it than say stratis-storage.",Neutral

I've had exactly one driver-based AMD issue - when I first got my 5700XT on release, there was a weird driver bug that caused the occasional BSOD when viewing video in a browser - this was fixed quickly.  My gaming stability issues were always caused by unstable RAM timings and CPU OC settings - since I upgraded to an AM5 platform with everything stock, I'm solid as a rock. My 7900XTX has been absolutely perfect.  There is an unfair perception in gaming with AMD's drivers where people think they are far worse than they really are - it's a circlejerk at this point.  Your issue is different (and valid), you don't need to conflate the known issues in professional use cases with gaming - it'll just get you pushback because people who use AMD cards for gaming (like me) know the drivers are fine for gaming, which makes you come across as being hyperbolic - and if you're being hyperbolic about the gaming stuff, what else are you being hyperbolic about?

This isn't a good point to be making, because it's just wrong.  > suffered from a silicon bug in it's PSP crippling some of it's core functionality  This again?  No, Radeon VII and other Vega products were killed off because they were very expensive to produce and they weren't moving enough units at any price to justify any further investment or even any meaningful support.  Everyone paying attention called this when they revealed Vega, and even long before with the tragic marketing.  Insert the GIF of Raja partying at the AMD event, complete with cigar.  People love coming up with theories as to what critical flaw or failure point caused a given generation of AMD GPUs to suck, and how those will be fixed in the next generation.  From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.  Does AMD need to improve things?  Of course.

Same goes to H.264 hardware encoder being worst of the bunch for years.  And the average joe just doesn't use Linux, if they do, then few of of them actually toy around virtualization, then even fewer of them poke around hypervisors with device passthrough(instead of using emulated devices, which has poor performance and compatibility). It really is the most niche of the niche circle. I'm not looking down on users or playing gatekeeping/elitism but that's just a hard pill to swallow.  But that doesn't mean AMD should be ghosting the issues as people have been expressing their concerns even on datacenter systems where real money flows.  How many r/Ayymd trolls actually know VDI, VFIO and let alone what ""reset"" means?

With how many people this happen with, it is not problem of Adrenalin itself (otherwise it would've been reported A LOT more than i can find).   They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.     From global issues with CPU OC was only one i mentioned. When AMD integrated Ryzen Master, old GPU OC presets did reset CPU OC values to default.

Intel,"Really disliking this trend of all new games having ""with FSR/DLSS"" in their PC requirements tables.

Intel,"Actually not to bad for current standards, 1440p 60 with fsr quality on a 6800xt/3080 is great if high includes RT, if it doesn't then it sucks",Negative
Intel,"So with my 6800xt, which should be able to do 1440p high settings at over 60fps easily, I'll have to use FSR just to get 60fps? Great, another unoptimized game headed our way.  So sick of the awful PC ports and such. 6800xt is still a very powerful card yet I'm seeing more and more games require it for 1440p 60fps high or even 1080p 60 fps high. Ridiculous.  The reliance on upscaling tech instead of properly optimizing the game is becoming a problem. And it seems this game has forced RT which is idiotic. RT destroys performance and should always be an option.",Negative

Intel,so I'm doomed to use FSR even at 1080p ? what a shame pc gaming has become.,Negative
Intel,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?  (I'm not talking about this game in particular, just in general, it was same outrage w/ AW2 and that turned out better than expected)",Neutral
Intel,I hope they will bundle this game with CPUs/GPUs,Positive

Intel,"Another garbage with forced upscaling at baseline. When upscaling winded up - everyone was ""Hell yeah, high refresh rate AAA gaming""  Fast forward to today: ""FSR performance just to hit 1080p 60fps - yay..""   I fucking knew it.. it was so obvious upscaling will turn into this and replace game optimizations. Why optimizing shit, when you can tell people to turn on fucking FSR / DLSS / XeSS performance??   What a fucking shitshow... And few weeks back when I said I'm not gonna buy AMD GPU again because upscaling is getting mandatory and DLSS is just objectively superior - I was laughed in the face. Every major AAA game onwards will be shoving up upscaling as base line performance - so your typical 60fps marks (and 30fps - yes apparently that is still a thing on PC in 2023).

With this being a based on a movie game, I don’t have super high hopes that that’ll be the case though. Going from movie to game and vice versa almost always has bad results.   Also, displaying system requirements with upscaling is a bad joke. This is basically saying you’re not getting native 1080p 60fps without a 6800xt or 3080. Upscaling is definitely becoming the crutch a lot of folks feared it would be.",Negative

In fact they were impressed with how well it ran and how it looked. I think there is a general 80% of the PC population that doesn't mess with graphic settings and just wants the game to play.

Intel,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",Neutral
Intel,Didn't take them long to make upscaling worthless.,Negative

Intel,"I've hated upscaling since the beginning.   Now, it's being proven right in our faces that companies are no longer making 100% they're making 45% done games, and then they rely on upscaling and fake frames to do the rest.   Why have a fully optimized game that runs well natively when you can just lower the resolution by 3x then have frame generation help?   Full force ahead to frame generation= Every game will be optimized so badly that you're forced to upscale",Negative
Intel,"It’s literally right there in the hardware specs. 1080p fsr2 quality is 720p input resolution, so at native the game runs at 720p low on a 1070 or 5700.  It is the inverse of what reviewers have been doing with their benchmarks - if you are a fan who really has a stick up their ass about native res, just do the math yourself. They’ve given you all the pieces you need to calculate it out yourself, but that’s not how the game is supposed to be run so they aren’t going to put native res in the official marketing material.  Games are optimized around upscaling now and it is unhelpful and misleading to pretend otherwise. Rendering 4x as many pixels is *obviously* going to throw things off with more intensive effects, and lead to a generally unplayable experience.",Neutral

Intel,"RT is the future. With this game and Alan Wake 2 using software RT at all times and hardware RT for anything beyond ""low"", RT is the future.

Intel,"people also forget both AMD and nvidia didn't really offer a generation leap in GPU performance this gen, sure it's popular to call games ""unoptimized"" (I know many AAA releases are, not denying that) but the issue compounds with the fact that game devs couldn't predict a GPU generation to be this bad caused by inflated crypro-boom margins a generation prior",Negative
Intel,"As with almost every game release recently, expect the game to perform a bit better than the requirements.    Sometimes the hardware can achieve 60 FPS most of the time but drops below that in other times, so the devs just say it's guaranteed 30 FPS and call it a day. If you look at the 5700 vs 6700XT, the gap is almost 50% in most titles, this means that if the numbers for the 5700 were accurate then the 6700XT will be getting around 45 FPS at 1080p low (unless the game utilizes special hardware only available on the 6700XT) but the game targets 60 FPS at 1080p high on the 6700XT which leads me to believe the 5700 is gonna perform much better which should leave room for turning off upscaling.",Positive
Intel,"It does state ray tracing in the top right, we don't know if that's included in the requirements or not. I would definitely reserve judgment until we find out.",Neutral

Intel,yup that is why I will play 1440 UW native with a 7900XTX.,Neutral
Intel,I guess they are confused with dlss.  Dlss 2= up scaling Dlss3 = frame gen  So they thought its for fsr3 too. ( as in fsr2 up scaling and 3 frame gen)   But fsr3 can do frame gen or not.  Fsr3 is up scaling and frame gen.,Neutral
Intel,"Likely mid range gpu and a suit yells in the background ""30 fps with up scaling is fine""",Neutral
Intel,"Likely the same, they didn't want to make the graph even more annoying, hence why fsr3 and rt and xess are mentioned top right.  They got anyway already confused with fsr3 and fsr2 ( cause 3 is fsr frame gen and up scaling it's not like dlss where 2 is up scaling and 3 is frame gen)",Negative
Intel,Very similar performance I guess,Neutral
Intel,Ye,Neutral
Intel,They've been using it since forever. The difference is that PC GPUs were 10x faster than console GPUs so there was no need for it on PC.,Neutral
Intel,"It mentions dlss, fsr3 and xess support, doubt they limited it to dlss2.",Neutral
Intel,"Likely, they were confused because dlss 2 and dlss3.  So they thought its fsr2 and 3 too.",Neutral

Intel,Honestly... Maybe fsr3 frame gen can help you but... A 3300 Was already outdated when it came out.,Negative
Intel,Most likely the upgrade part called FSR 2 and the frame creation part called FSR 3,Neutral
Intel,If they didnt get confused between FSR 3 and 2 then yes fsr 3 roughly doubles fps same for AFMF.,Neutral
Intel,"Nah usually enthusiast in hardware did mean "" max settings no compromises high frames"" but let's say... This changed the last 3 gens sadly.",Neutral
Intel,"with AFMF it works , didnt test with FSR3 now.",Neutral
Intel,Reading before raging :),Neutral
Intel,"It is even low quality with 30fps and still needs 5700 ~~XT~~. That is pretty bad :D  *Corrected to 5700, which I think is still a lot for FSR2 at low fullHD, but definitely cheaper GPU.",Negative
Intel,That's with 5700 and 1070.... WHAT exactly are you expecting those cards to do in visually demanding AAA titles in 2023?  People have some crazy expectations. Everyone wants the eye candy but no one wants to pay the performance cost.,Negative
Intel,For 30fps even lol,Neutral
Intel,"Especially recommending FSR.  DLSS at 1080p? Sure why not?   FSR at 1080p? Disgusting, absolutely horrific.  Anyone who downvotes this is a fanboy, end of story. Nvidia's DLSS simply is better at reconstructing an image. At lower resolutions that is SIGNIFICANTLY more important.",Negative
Intel,Or be happy your shitty video card is still supported.,Neutral
Intel,and we still get shat on for saying they are or admitting its a bad thing. corpo fanbois are so cringe,Negative
Intel,Even 4090 users use DLSS because it fixes TAA problems. And has a sharpening slider for easy sharpening adjustment.,Positive
Intel,When did I ever complain about how expensive gpus are. I've always been in the category that they are luxury item and vendor can charge whatever they want for em. So you aint never hear me complain about gpu prices.,Negative
Intel,I can't market a game for running with 120fps 4k with raytracing on on a RTX 4060.  But I can market 400 completely identical missions that take up 150 hours of your lifespan and empty out your soul.,Negative
Intel,Yea I know nothing about optimizations and if it could or couldn't fix this or that. I just want them to tell me exactly what I need to run the game at X resolution a Y preset with 60 fps. If that calls for a 14900k and a 4090 then just say so.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, I think we're really beginning to see a trend here with abusing upscaling for free mileage.  Not that upscaling isn't great but...  Apart from RT, on medium settings, I can't really see    massive improvements on visual quality that would warrant such a massive increase on requirements.  UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  We'll probably see this continuing to be a trend for a while, and then as tech novelty wears out, some devs will come out with more optimized and scalable titles.  With hardware prices being as they are, and with 60fps now being highly requested in consoles as well, it's pretty much a given.",Negative
Intel,"People accepted upscaling with open arms, so now devs know they can rely on people using it. Thus they don't have to care about optimizing for native res anymore. Oh you have a 4k card? Okay well we'll make sure it can run the game at 1080p so you can upscale it.",Neutral
Intel,"No average consumer wanted to come to this point. The market leader started pushing upscaling instead of just making stronger GPU’s and there’s nothing AMD can do to win them, only join them.",Negative
Intel,Turns out TAA is worse than AI TAA with AI upscaling.   Of course devs are gonna use it to cover their own asses. And they get perf boost!  Let's face it. The FUTURE is AI everything. Nobody is gonna talk shit about frame generation and upscaling when it looks perfect each frame.,Negative
Intel,But it does in many ways.,Neutral
Intel,"I don't know who those people are. I play all my games on native, whether I'm using an amd or nvidia card.",Neutral
Intel,"dlss looks better than native with TAA because taa is so bad, but dlaa/fsraa at native >>>> upscaling",Negative
Intel,you think engine devs can pressure AMD and even Nvidia? Come on man. Be real.,Negative
Intel,"Ever notice how multi-GPU vanished the moment DX12 shifted the onus from AMD/Nvidia over to the developers? It shows just how much effort they put into getting SLI/Crossfire working when developers instantly drop them the moment they have to do the bulk of the work (significantly less, I might add) themselves.",Negative
Intel,"If I relabeled ""Medium"" preset to ""Ultra"" preset and changed nothing else and told you that you can run this game at Native 1440P Ultra on a midrange 7800XT card and get 60+FPS, would that be ""optimized"" now?",Neutral
Intel,speaking facts my guy,Neutral
Intel,You shouldn't have downvote dood wtf redditors ?,Neutral
Intel,People with AMD cards dislike upscaling more because FSR sucks ass lol.,Negative
Intel,"Uhm, me btw...",Neutral
Intel,"> Who actually plays games at native these days, if it has upscaling?  I do.",Neutral
Intel,"I won't judge your preferences, but at least using native rendenring isnt the clown show we have here. Native 4k look the same no matter what gpu render it (performances aside). Now with all the quality preset, we can't figure what quality to expect. 4k60fps at balenced preset? What's that crap even supposed to mean as thoses presets vary from title to title, from NVIDIA to amd. And btw, I'm still using fxaa over taa and fsr when i can, don't ask me why.",Negative
Intel,"You're even seeing this on console, where Spiderman 2 now has RT reflections in every mode. Even Unreal 5's Lumen renderer is a software raytracer that can be hardware accelerated.  RT is the future because there are scenarios that rasterized rendering is just not capable of resolving. Screen space reflection artifacts, light leaking, weird glow on indirectly lit models... I find these so distracting and immersion breaking.",Neutral
Intel,onto absolutely nothing.,Negative
Intel,"Wait what? No performance improvement this gen? Bullshit, RTX 4090 is literally 2 times faster than RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 is only 10% Faster than the 3080  you do the math. RTX 4080 is 50% Faster than RTX 3080.",Negative
Intel,Or the game performs at 50 fps at 1080p low on 5700 but 50fps is a weird number to target and they can't say 60 so they just say 30fps and call it a day.,Negative
Intel,Not if it's using mesh shaders like Alan wake. In that game the GTX 1650 outperforms the 1080ti.,Neutral
Intel,The game is raytracing only with a ridiculous ammount of foooliage.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm so glad this is finally getting more main stream spotlight.  I do a little bit in Dota 2 and the amount of people that simply have a terrible experience because of a single stick of ram in that title is staggering.  Sure, it's an outlier, but a lot of esports/CPU bound games see similar issues.",Negative
Intel,i wonder when dual rank and dual channel will start being listed too. since dual rank does help gaming,Neutral
Intel,Honestly my 1070 still runs great for what it is. It’s in my sons rig now because it couldn’t keep up with 1440p depending on the game and definitely not 4k. Still a fairly solid 1080p card.,Positive
Intel,False.  guy blocked me lmao,Neutral
Intel,"I thought that was on Linux, though I might be wrong",Negative
Intel,1070 doesn't have hardware RT though.,Neutral
Intel,According to the technical director there's no non-raytracing mode. I'm assuming that means software ray tracing for the minimum spec.  Source: Skill Up video - https://youtu.be/v91y87R5iDk?t=332 (5m32s),Neutral
Intel,Spoken like someone who has never upscaled 1080p content on a 1440 screen. The pixel ratios are all off. It's fucked.  1440p is perfect for watching old 720p HD content though.,Negative
Intel,Completely agree.,Neutral
Intel,Damn my brain must have been on auto pilot. I'm so used to 2160p + FSR quality neatly equalling 1440p.,Negative
Intel,I see the 5700 and the GTX 1070 on the minimum specs. Are those cards going to be RT capable for this game? (It's 30FPS LOW with FSR but still.),Neutral
Intel,"Sometimes the DigitalFoundry reviewers use their meme powers for good (eg:fighting shader compilation stutter), but their  >""it's better than native!""   memeing about upscaling seems to have gone sideways.",Negative
Intel,"Dude tells truth, go to Nvidia sub, and you fond every second post someone telling that DLSS looks better then native, and every time I tell them that I can tell the difference between native and upscaled and it's not better then natibe they call me a liar and downvote.",Negative
Intel,It's purely on the devs for targeting low performance.   We could be getting 240fps at 4K using those upscaling techniques.,Neutral
Intel,"Derp, derp.",Neutral
Intel,Sounds like John on Direct Foundry Direct every week.,Neutral
Intel,"""Avatar will be a title that will only appear with ray tracing. But we're developing the game so that the quality and performance will be scalable.""  Seems I was right.",Positive
Intel,">I guess the wonders of everyone jumping on the Swiss knife engine approach ue rather than doing their own engines made for their games.  Facepalm...  Avatar Frontiers of Pandora very literally uses a custom engine, not Unreal Engine.",Neutral
Intel,Yep. This company learned something from all the failure game launches that happened this year. The game companies can't just implement one gpu company's tech and not the others bc then it'll only work on the one gpu that you implemented the tech for and it won't work on the other gpus from other companies. Meaning for example if a game company only implemented fsr it's only going to work on amd gpus and not on Nvidia and Intel gpus and vise versa is true too for both Nvidia and Intel gpus for dlss and xess.,Negative
Intel,Avatar is RT only. There is no non RT mode.,Neutral
Intel,This is mad with snowdrop engine. It's Ubisoft they don't use unreal...,Negative
Intel,"Yep, I missed that. Good call! Makes sense why the specs are a bit higher then but if it is forced on, that's going to be rough on any one with a more mid tier card.",Neutral
Intel,">  Consoles use mostly FSR balanced  heck sometimes they use performance or less, heck a lot of the time even. Especially with RT or performance modes",Neutral
Intel,They have really long way to go. Take for example Lords of the Fallen - UE5's TSR is better than FSR. Take Alan Wake 2 and you get ton of shimmering on the edges. It's also not like nvidia not improving - so while AMD makes a step forward so will do nvidia..   There's also question how much they improve without dedicated accelerators that both Intel and nvidia is using. Intel jumped late to the party and they're already ahead - which just shows how much AMD cares. It's rally embarrassing considering both XBOX and PlayStation are also relying on FSR - ant that's bigger market than what nvidia has.,Neutral
Intel,I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?  I mean the facts are the facts. I need to play on lower settings till we get a 5070 or 8800xt.,Neutral
Intel,"It uses their own in-house engine, Snowdrop. The last game this developer did was The Division II which was excellent.",Neutral
Intel,"Took a look at some gameplay on YouTube, and it does look nice enough, though water looked like ass, and as mentioned already, it's an in-house engine (which is nice to see TBH).",Positive
Intel,You will never see a high production game from Ubisoft ever on the Steam store ever again at initial launch.  They are the anti-christ of the gaming industry seriously.,Negative
Intel,Consoles are the baseline in most multiplat games and they've been using upscaling since forever. The real reason is just that we don't have GPUs anymore that are 10x faster than consoles like last gen. You can't bruteforce high resolutions in games that run at like 720p on consoles with GPUs that are only 2-3x faster.  If upscaling didn't exist on PC the minimum here would just be 720p at the minimum and 1080p-1440p at the max.,Negative
Intel,Next-gen doesn't mean that current gen can run it well. It means it's so far ahead that most curren-gen hardware can't run it properly + top-end hardware can only barely run it well.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly. These paid exclusive games launches only make me care less whenever they actually release.  It's not just Epic, Meta has done it with several games (Moss Book 2) and when a proper looking pcvr port comes a year later it sells bad because people forgot about it.",Negative
Intel,"Is that with significant RT? I assumed it was ""normal"" ultra settings.  Still I can play Far Cry 6 and RE4 with AMD sponsored RT at 4k native with 100fps. This game will have to look amazing to justify what... a quarter of that performance?",Neutral
Intel,"You are correct. I overlooked the part where, under Ultra settings, it said that was with FSR2. Now it doesn't seem as bad. I mean, it's still not good because it's rendering somewhere between 1080p and 1440p, but at least it's not 30 fps without Frame Gen/60 fps with it like I thought.",Neutral
Intel,"It might be, AFAIK neither Nvidia nor AMD still support their implementation of it in their drivers.  But I've tried it on a few games and it is pretty cool to me, much stronger than almost any modern 3D movie (IMO why 3D has gone into hibernation), and I gather that Cameron designed the franchise around 3D.  Plus the Avatar 1 game was in 3D.  FWIW.",Positive
Intel,This is what I am thinking too.,Neutral
Intel,"You say that, but they specifically mentioned FSR3, and just DLSS, so i have a feeling DLSS3 will have to go via a mod again.",Neutral
Intel,"i have a believe that even 4C8T will survive for the decade, like the case of that 4790K. But turns out these newer UE5 games are wrecking even newish CPU like the 3600. i mean cmon it's still a 4 years CPU old which i think it's not old yet",Neutral
Intel,Let's hope so. 30fps is far from recommended for FSR 3,Positive
Intel,Yeah I heard it works with that hoping it works with fsr3 now,Positive
Intel,"I've noticed that for some reason newer games look blurry at 1080 even without any kind of upscaling and I'm not sure why, older game look much sharper at 1080p",Negative
Intel,"Just lazy optimisation, that’s pretty much a PS5 equivalent GPU and you can be damn sure that the console version won’t be 1080P 30fps with FSR",Negative
Intel,"No it says 5700. NOT 5700XT, and yes there is a difference. Quite literally the difference between a 1070 and 1080ti. Or a 2070 and 2080.",Neutral
Intel,no no my 7 year old card needs to be able to play at high settings. so does my low end card from today. gotta be high or its just bad,Negative
Intel,Crazy expectation? A game released in 2023 should be able to run at 1080p low 30fps on a low end card like rx6500xt (lowest end modern card you can buy now).  Optimization matters.,Neutral
Intel,"Yup, these cards came out around the time of ps4 I think..that's a long time ago in the graphical quality of games we are seeing.  People should be happy to a point that those cards can even run some of these games if upscaling helps them run that's a bonus as it means they don't need to upgrade if those graphics settings are acceptable to them.",Positive
Intel,"I have a 5700 and it does better at 1080p on these games than what is normally posted. Now it does need quality fsr but its not the worst thing, anything lower than quality is. Bottom line is these are not 100% correct and never have been.  I have zero interest in this game but the specs seem fine even though I wish upscaling wasn't what was relied on for optimization.",Negative
Intel,"well you dont know what they mean by 30 fps. It could be de 1% lows or the average, we dont know. The easy assumption is that it will be 30 fps average. but that's crazy that a game at 1080p low cant be run by a 5700. It better be a new Crysis.  edit: apparently it uses raytracing only for lighting which would explain the hows and why it crushes the framerate so bad especially on a gpu that doesnt have hardware raytracing like the 5700.",Negative
Intel,"Or in the case of games like Alan Wake 2, you will get unplayable fps if you try to running it at 4k native max settings. Even with a 4090, you will get a glorious 20fps.",Negative
Intel,Assassins creed origins and odyssey side quests/collectibles oh my god,Positive
Intel,Yeah it doesn't give us a actual gauge to understand what we need for set native parameters. I mentioned optimization out of concern that they rely too much on upscaling and it seems like it's the lazy way out of something. It's unrealistic that a usable gaming experience be in a top tier hardware setup that costs $2k+ and top tier hardware of just the last generation are just barely cutting it anymore.,Negative
Intel,I appreciate your insights and opinions. Thank you.,Positive
Intel,">UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  Because they market how ""good"" it looks, not how ""well"" it runs. There's a big influence from marketing perspective to place high focus on ""eye candy"", it's what sells.  The how ""well"" it runs is usually restricted to the small % of us gaming nerds. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flip_out)",Neutral
Intel,console games started upscaling way before PCs .,Negative
Intel,This sub is rife with crazy conspiracy theories. I don't think it was this insane a couple years back.,Negative
Intel,you forgot who owns one of the most popular engines out there?,Neutral
Intel,"I guess technically it would count but then everyone would flame it for looking bad. But seriouly, what happened when Ultra settings ran real smooth on top of the line hardware? Gone those times.",Negative
Intel,downvoted by devs lol,Neutral
Intel,> RTX 4080 is 50% Faster than RTX 3080.  The msrp is 71% higher too.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah at 1200 bucks and above you got one, that's true but many cards below didn't offer much.",Neutral
Intel,that's stoopid but it's somewhat more understandable. Why a 5700 would struggle so much since it doesnt have hardware raytracing,Negative
Intel,Yep it's like a 10/15% performance uplift in some games but I'd guess they would prefer to keep the requirements sheets somewhat simple.,Neutral
Intel,Why is there a dialog message about unsupported hardware when you try and run a 390X?,Negative
Intel,It can do software based RT just like every other modern GPU out there.,Neutral
Intel,Well then no wonder rx 5700 can't manage 30 fps lol,Neutral
Intel,"Wait so we are finally getting games made only with ray tracing in mind? This is actually great, 2023 is officially the year the new generation started",Positive
Intel,Avatars uses a Lumen like software RT solution.,Neutral
Intel,"yeah they never finished the sentence for some reason. The full sentences is ""its better than native, when native has forced taa!"" which is why dlaa/fsraa at native look so much better than the upscale versions. normal basic TAA is just so bad, that even upscales not using it look better than native using it",Negative
Intel,"The AA side of things might be better, but I swear no matter the resolution textures become a blurry mess even with Quality mode etc, and it irks me that most people don't seem to notice that.",Negative
Intel,Some people seem to have very low sensitivity to added blur. See also *depth of field blur* and *motion blur* being on by default in every game. It's funny how much people rage against FXAA/DoF/Motion blur but ignore DLSS.  Of course only one is tied to someone's purchasing decision :),Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, thatsl happened.",Neutral
Intel,">every time I tell them that I can tell the difference between native and upscaled and it's not better then natibe they call me a liar and downvote  Well, yes, you are using shitty FSR which is literally unplayable no matter resolution instead of godly DLSS that is literally better than native even at 720p/performance. The only way you could have seen the ever unmatched DLSS for PC kings instead of the plebean FSR is through a compressed youtube video so your opinion is literally invalid. I hope I am being sarcastic enough.",Negative
Intel,"The problem is some (if not most) games have such a bad TAA it might as well be true, and if often cannot but turned off.",Negative
Intel,"""We could"" but not profitable. Just let imagine these games does not exist in our reality.",Negative
Intel,You didn't understand. It's another Swiss knife engine,Negative
Intel,"It is indeed not a great situation. Things like this shouldn't be forced on, and it leaves me feeling like they haven't given the devs enough time to optimize the settings.",Negative
Intel,It works because most consoles players are noobs they don't care about the tech. They just want to sit on the couch and play. I'm hoping we see them start working more on FSR3 and upgrading older games to it. And you are right nvidia will keep moving forward but so will AMD. They may never catch them since they have a head start.,Positive
Intel,AMD just released drivers for Alan Wake 2 that fixed the flickering while using FSR.,Neutral
Intel,The PS5 has a 6700.,Neutral
Intel,">I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?   Not exactly. It's a custom quasi-RDNA2 design (has the improved RDNA2 compute units, but it's missing a few features such as fully-DX12-compliant mesh shaders and VRS-capable ROPs).  For most purposes, it's pretty comparable to a 6700 (non-XT), with the same number of CUs (36), and similar clockspeeds.",Neutral
Intel,"Oh, wow. I didn't know that. But it'll likely be on a similar level as UE5, right?",Positive
Intel,Next gen DOES NOT MEAN that your CURRENT GEN hardware can run it well for sure... Why don't people get that?,Negative
Intel,That reminds me to grab moss 1 and 2. I just got a quest 3.   Agreed though. I’ve been waiting for kingdom hearts 3 to come to steam for so long that I’m basically going to skip it at this point. It’s still stuck on the epic game store.,Neutral
Intel,Far cry 6 and re4 are older and or lower demanding games.  And yes any Mode here does either Hardware or Software rt from. Min to max.,Neutral
Intel,It's a 4 year old cpu yes... But how it was built (4c) was like 10 12 years now old.  6 cores are since a few years already base and more and more 8 cores are standard.,Neutral
Intel,TAA,Neutral
Intel,Temporal anti aliasing.,Neutral
Intel,"TAA is the devil. it forces a blur on every frame, and only gets worse as the resolution goes lower. its why fsr, xess, and dlss can look better than """"native"""" because it doesnt use the horrid plain taa solution so many games do. and why dlaa, and fsraa are so important and need to replace taa completely",Negative
Intel,"Ahh, welcome to r/FuckTAA",Neutral
Intel,Even 4K looks blurry with some implementations of TAA,Negative
Intel,they're giving you the bare minimum until your upgrade!,Neutral
Intel,Because they are built with upscaling in mind so they have a blurry looks intentionally as it works best with aggressive upscaling.,Neutral
Intel,"Not even close, you're completely out of your mind. The 5700xt is 9% faster than the 5700. The 1080ti is **32%** faster than a 1070 and the 2080 is **19%** faster than the 2070.

Intel,"The 5700 and 5700xt is more like a 1070 and 1070ti situation. It's not that big a gap, and you can close it even tighter because the majority of RX 5700 cards can be flashed to a 5700xt bios tightening the gap farther.",Neutral

Intel,Those are some dumbass expectations. Maybe you should correct them instead of blaming the developers for it.,Neutral
Intel,"The 6500XT offers $200 2016 performance. In fact its often worse because of how gimped it is interface wise. Its one of the worst products released in recent years.  Its not the game developers fault AMD pretty much rebadged the RX 480 4 times and they can't be expected to sink their optimization to that level.  RX 480, RX580, RX 5500XT and RX6500XT are virtualy the same product performance wise. RX 5500XT is the most consistent one of the lot offering a somewhat more modern arhitecture in its 8GB variant. The 6500XT on the other hand while on a newer arhitecture is an unmitigated disaster that is on par at best and sinks even below the RX580 when memory, bus and PCIE interface constrained.  The console baseline is around 6700XT/2070 Super/3060ti level. People better get used to that as its gonna become or already has become the norm for 1080p high settings gaming. The 5700 is upwards of 30% slower by default while also having less hardware features. Its gonna become the minimum norm going forward alongside the 2060's of your time.",Negative
Intel,"the 1070 was 2016, the 5700 was 2019. While both not new its not 10 years old like the PS4 (2013)",Neutral
Intel,This is literally only true if you use path tracing. I think you're trying to insinuate the game is unoptimized when it just scales really high with visual features if your hardware supports it. It straight up runs great for the visual features it uses.,Neutral
Intel,"That was exclusive to console releases, no? And never to the point of replacing AA sharpening and rendering the game from 720p…",Neutral
Intel,No I havent. AMD is bigger than Epic.,Neutral
Intel,"Right, you'll have different complaints but complaints none the less even though the new Ultra might still look slightly better prior gen games and offer high FPS but people would complain that the graphics are not advancing fast enough, they look the same etc etc.  Yah those days are likely gone but it's hard to say if it's because the game is unoptimized or if the dev is really pushing the limits of what they can do graphically and use upscaling as a buffer because what they have in mind, or what they intend to show is too taxing for current hardware. We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it. This is why I've never in my life ever pre-ordered a game. I still don't understand why people do it (esp now that games are digital) but lot of people do. Then again I've never really paid for a ""skin"" or some other visual add-on so maybe that's what attracts people.  I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets. The presets are all relative anyways. There's no universal settings that define what each preset represents.  I just don't get the outrage on these minimum spec sheets compared to what the game is showing graphically. At least wait until it releases and we have some hard data.",Negative
Intel,"I'm also a dev dood sometimes it's literally a ""foutage de geugle"" I had a friend who talk about how shit devs in EA (the people who's making the engine) code and doesn't optimise",Negative
Intel,"The commenter I replied to said there wasn't a big generational improvement for GPUs, while I said there was. But I agree that 4080 is expensive for what it offers.",Neutral
Intel,It was the same price as a 3090 at launch and offers 90% more performance.  It was definitely a generational leap.,Positive
Intel,It's software ray tracing which isn't accelerated by hardware.,Neutral
Intel,and i guess it can be hard to tell if ram is dual or single rank with just two sticks of it too.,Neutral
Intel,>might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.  I was pointing out that 1070 doesn't have hardware RT either.,Negative
Intel,So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?,Negative
Intel,"Why not make it toggleable though, you can choose other graphics settings so it makes no sense. Most people don't play games with RT enabled",Negative
Intel,Still kinda weird that they put the RX 5700/A750 on the same ballpark as the 1070... Being that the newer GPUs actually perform closer to a 1080(Ti).,Neutral
Intel,Sounds like improperly configured negative LOD bias. If you have Nvidia you can fix it with nvinspector. On AMD there's nothing you can do IIRC if Devs mess it up.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly what I'm telling them all the time, that I can see difference in textures, in hair, fences, powerlines etc. And every time I get downvoted by the army of ""but it looks better then native"". I feel like majority of that sub needs to go get a prescription for new glasses",Negative
Intel,"So if you stopped measuring who's bigger, why do you think I have no access to DLSS? Tested on rig with 4080 on a C2 42"" screen. Once you stop thinking with the tip of your head where probably Nvidia's logo is tattooed or maybe Jensen's face, who knows, you could come to realization that one person have access to more hardware then only his personal rig.  Do I say that FSR is better then DLSS? No! Both of them have their issues, but none of them is better then native. Keep on fanboying mate, instead of providing normal convoy as grownups",Neutral
Intel,I don't think YOU understand what you're talking about.  Did you seriously expect Snowdrop to be something used in like one game and then discarded completely?,Negative
Intel,"The thing is: creating good looking lightning with RT is much easier than with prebaked illumination. I can fully understand, why developers of new games are using RT as the basis of their game.",Positive
Intel,Minimum requirements go up as games get/look better. They probably made this game with the series s as the minimum. Low settings probably looks better than high in most games.   Rt for the last few years has been added on top of already complete games. Now games are being made with rt as the standard and they would have to manually do a ton of extra work to support 7+ year old hardware. It's the same as having to drop support for last gen consoles to be able to deliver a better game.,Neutral
Intel,"And still - superior upscaling makes it worth paying extra, RT on higher end is worth paying extra. AMD even this gen doesn't undercut price by enough, especially in EU where power efficiency also play a role. For example, assuming I'm gonna use GPU for 2 gens, then I save ~90-100€ with my usage just on electricity alone. I know it's over period of 4 years, but still it's price difference that will recoup over time, even if I have to pay extra upfront. AMD is simply no longer a value proposition.",Neutral
Intel,"They did not, lol - that fixes completely different thing, not the FSR caused shimmering edges.",Negative
Intel,Both excellent 👌 Down the Rabbit Hole was another solid one.,Positive
Intel,"RE4 came out this year.  Anyway the difference between us is I don't think any lighting effect is worth a $1,000 GPU using 1080p resolution and 60fps, but I know many disagree. That's life.",Neutral
Intel,"3600 and the 3300x was built with the TSMC 7nm if i recall, that was 2018 cutting edge tech. and somehow in gaming it's already obsolete. i was planning to replace mine with 5700x  but i cancel it because it's still very much capable for what i do now. but now after UE5 i think i'll reconsider it again, maybe even as far as 5800X3D",Neutral
Intel,It is crazy that I see everyone saying that modern games look blurry. I've known for years taa does this but it seems like I see more people than ever dissatisfied by it.,Negative

Intel,r/FuckTAA,Neutral
Intel,"My friend nicknamed it after his eyesight. When he wears glasses he has 20/20, but when he doesn’t he says that he sees the image about the same as without glasses",Neutral
Intel,"Out of curiosity what resolution do you usually game at and at what distance? I find taa usually looks pretty good in modern games, but I'm also playing on a TV (48 inches but I'm not at monitor distance anymore). When I played on my 1920x1200 monitor I HATED TAA, well, not as much as fxaa, but moreso than smaa, and I missed msaa or SGSSAA with a passion. Now on the TV at 4k (lol, usually not on a 6700xt), 1440p, or even 1080p I find TAA can do a pretty decent job paired with varying levels of the Radeon sharpness adjustment in the adrenaline drivers. But again, probably due to viewing distance.  Looks leagues better than FXAA and I prefer it to SMAA now. But again, I'm sitting further away and tweaking sharpening to my liking. FSR2 seems to be a wash most of the time but the performance gain is worth it.",Positive
Intel,You dumbass do understand that even the console version of the recent games are total mess? Alan wake 2 have to run on reduced settings to even reach 30fps on xbox/PS. Callisto protocol used to have frametime issue on consoles. Console ports still targets 30fps on quality settings with upscaling while target should be 60fps with 120fps for performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, seems you are correct, it was the ps4 pro that came out in 2016, still, I wouldn't expect that to be capable of running some of the games we are seeing now without some serious compromises.",Neutral
Intel,I never said that Alan Wake 2 is unoptimised. I just said that even a 4090 can’t max out the game at native 4K resolution.,Negative
Intel,epic is tencent...,Neutral
Intel,"In terms of absolute numbers sure, 3090 always had a stupid price tho for being 10% faster than a 3080.   In terms of performance per dollar the 4090 even at 2x 3080 performance was worse value since you pay 1600 not 1400.",Negative
Intel,"Yes, you either have to get the spec sheet of the RAM modules (That even then it may not specify if it's a single/dual rank module) or test it in a system and use HWinfo/CPU-Z. Not as straightforward as dual channel that's mostly just using two identical modules.",Neutral
Intel,You don't need RT hardware to do software RT. That's what I'm saying.,Neutral
Intel,"For this particular game, there is a software fallback. Also, even if we did get a game that mandated hardware support for RT they'd still likely build it with console in mind so even RDNA2 GPUs shouldn't have issues",Neutral
Intel,"The first RT/DLSS capable cards are 5 years old now, way older than the current consoles. You are definitely not being left behind if you're only outdated by 1 gen lol",Neutral
Intel,I mean the last non ray tracing cards were released 4 years ago (1650/60 and 5000s from AMD),Neutral
Intel,Games running poorly on computers weaker than current gen consoles isn't exactly anything new.,Neutral
Intel,"No, you have multiple generations of games from prior to raytracing to enjoy.  Games shouldn't be held back forever just because someone wants to game on a GeForce2 MX400.",Neutral
Intel,You are stuck playing older games. Unless someone can find a way to disable it with a mod.,Negative
Intel,> So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?  A gen old is second gen RT e.g. rtx 3000.  We're halfway through the third RT/matrix generation right now.,Negative
Intel,Yes hah,Neutral
Intel,"The 3090 or 6950xt will very likely run this game extremely well, they're a gen old.",Positive
Intel,"For the AMD GPU, it's probably because minimum will be the max it will support. Medium probably requires Hardware RT.  For Intel, I don’t know. Perhaps it signal not so great optimization for Intel GPUs...",Neutral
Intel,DLSS is very strong in thin lines like fences & hair. Much better than most TAA solutions. Not sure about FSR in general.  An example: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6erA6BVkAAuf_M?format=jpg&name=large  Only DLSS resolves the lines properly.,Positive
Intel,"I mean, it's not that black and white. Quality upscaling to 1080 will obviously be more noticeable than 4k. Maybe you *can* tell the difference between 4k native and dlss quality, but people aren't gonna believe you unless you prove it with some kind of blind test, but I doubt you'd be willing to go out of your way to do that.  Even if you could, the benefits of better aa might outweight some negligible drop in textures or whatever it is upscaling reduces. Though that's irrelevant when DLAA or NAA are options too, I guess.",Neutral
Intel,"Test, which one looks better, explain.  https://imgsli.com/MjE3MzEy",Neutral
Intel,Oh man the hair... its so crazy how much upscaling kills the hair..,Negative
Intel,i mean they already arent the smartest bulbs considering they went team green.,Neutral
Intel,Reading comrehension dude.,Neutral
Intel,"I do, but thanks for your interest.",Positive
Intel,That will depend on the user. Power is cheap here in canada so none of thar factors into my buying decisions. And rt will depends on the games you play also not everyone plays tripple a games.,Neutral
Intel,"You need to get 23.20.17.05.  Fixed Issues Intermittent flicker may be observed on some textures while playing Alan Wake 2.  Fixed for most people, also has a nice performance boost of about 10fps from what I'm seeing.  That being said I always prefer native resolution unless absolutely necessary. So far only had to use it in Martha is Dead.",Positive
Intel,Nice. It’s on the list. Thanks man,Positive
Intel,Yes.... 7nm was but 4 cores the actual important thing was obsolete like 10 or 12 years ago.,Neutral
Intel,Probably because TAA is (unfortunately) more prevalent than it ever was.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, most people are FINE with it. Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  The thing is, you have sharpening filters today. You can adjust the sharpening for TAA. You can make it look oversharpened if you want. There's driver level sharpening for both AMD and NVIDIA. Both also have software sharpening filters.  And DLSS and FSR bot have sharpening sliders.  There's 3 ways to adjust how blurry and how sharp the game looks for everyone. It's a non issue and even Digital Foundry acknowledges the benefits of TAA for game devs vs things like the blur. At the end of the day, these games are looking great...in this era, with exceptions. Not all games are blur. The whole blur thing was like in the past 4 years since upscalers started and TAA became the norm. But with all the sharpening options, and with devs actually used to making TAA not so soft looking, things are definitely getting a lot better for TAA.",Neutral
Intel,Oh my bad if I read that wrong,Negative
Intel,And I'm saying 1070 doesn't have hardware RT so it's just as gimped as AMD cards when doing RT.,Negative
Intel,Still pretty annoying nonetheless. Until it's stable no way should it be forced upon a game when someone's willing to run it normally at native.,Negative
Intel,"and the 2080ti is still winning, best purchase in gpu i made in a long time.",Positive
Intel,imagine being mad that 4 year old cards arent high end,Neutral
Intel,I'm on a 6700XT. 🙇. I just feel very shocked that I would probably need a gpu upgrade soon. With the demands of new games. Also 1440p ruined me.,Negative
Intel,"Technically makes sense, but they can just make RT something you can toggle between Software/Hardware and they also could just add the Vega 56 in the requirement sheet being that was AMD's competitor to the 1070 or they could've added the GTX 1080(Ti)/RTX 2060(Super) into the sheet.  On Intel's side they only have the A580 as the closest GPU to a 1070, even when it's too similar to the A750 performance wise :/",Neutral
Intel,"It is that black and white for me. I can immediately see the added image softness from upscaling, and it's especially prevalent with DLSS 2.5+ unless you enable a sharpening filter. DLAA also has weird issues like blurring textures (almost like it reverts to initial mipmap) while moving, usually at mid-distance from camera. It's too distracting and I have to go back to regular TAA. Immediately goes away.  1440p to 2160p is better than 720p to 1080p, but it's still noticeable. Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible? No. Actually changing monitor resolution outside of native and having all UI elements scaled looks terrible. That was what we used to do and upscaling is much better than that alternative. LCD panels need to stay at native signal resolution and GPU should scale render resolutions.",Negative
Intel,"And you look at static image all the time while gaming? It's different story when movement is involved, that's where you find all the artefacts you get. Static image doesn't tell a thing when it comes to gaming",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, and that's driving me crazy. I really couldn't stand it in Cyberpunk (in other titles it's either hit or miss), that I play it in native 4k instead.",Negative
Intel,"Wouldn't phrase it like that tough. I had that choice too in January, and actually by going 4070Ti instead of 7900XT I would be able to play Cyberpunk in higher fidelity and better frames then on mine, because AMD cooked FSR3.0 almost a year in the oven, and God knows how long it will take for CDPR to add it to the game, if ever considering that active development on game is ended and they are on bug fixing sprint right now. Also AMD needs to fix FSR in general, because how it works with smaller details like hair and fences is awful. But don't get me wrong, I love my card, just feel I git sold on features that would come handy right kow instead of when I don't need them anymore",Neutral
Intel,"Sorry mate, guess I need to read comments early morning instead of late night, just saw that last bit. My apologies. I'm just tired of upscalare wars whatever sub I go, and green team fanboys screaming that ""FSR is shit, DLSS is better then native"" and then throwing around static images for comparison",Negative
Intel,"It's for textures, not object edges from FSR use, lol. Two completely different things",Neutral
Intel,"people echoing the same shit like ""ooh 4C is obsolete, you need to upgrade that geriatric cpu"". 4C is still solid for gaming (ofc no UE5) and literally anything beside doing compute intensive professional workloads.",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening makes the image less blurry, but it doesn't recover the texture detail lost from TAA blur.",Negative
Intel,"""Even Nvidia foundry""   \---   they are like chief proponents of blur-tech and they don't care about how sharp and easy-to-see the image is. TAA flattens the image so you can't see which objects are far and which are near, you have to strain your eyes and mind to determine that which is unbearable to many. Just give us option to disable it even if it breaks some effects (which is just lazy thing to do on the side of devs)",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening fixes blur, not clearity. That is TAA destroys+add significant ghosting no matter the implementation.      Sharpening looks was worse than the normal cleairy of games, it's not the same thing at all.      >Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  We are mad because it being forced 1 and 2 it's being used to hide lazy effects that break without temporal frame smearing. People are now punished for turning off forced frame smearing.",Negative
Intel,And I'm saying that maybe the GTX 1070 is better at even software RT compared to AMD cards with no RT hardware. GTX 10 series card did get RTX support through CUDA even though they were horribly bad at it. Older AMD cards with no RT hardware didn't get any support like that from AMD.,Neutral
Intel,"You're not forced to use upscaling though. Unless you replied to the wrong person this is about ray tracing, which can be run at native just fine. If your GPU can't handle RT at native res, then just use upscaling.",Neutral
Intel,The minimum requirements for this game includes de 1070: a 7-year-old gpu from 2016.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm not really shocked, and was out there telling people not to buy those cards on day 1 in large part because of their deficiencies in RT performance and complete lack of matrix accelerators (which Nvidia and Intel have both made a large part of their architecture and got shockingly good results with - DLSS and matrix-XeSS are twice as good as FSR)",Negative
Intel,5700 was probably the lowest AMD card they had to test with.,Neutral
Intel,"It also looks better in gameplay, less ghosting, less shimmering, less aliasing.   So which one looks better? You clearly see the difference in textures/fences/powerline, right?  I even made it easier for you, both images are 1080p output.",Positive
Intel,I personally didn't try DLSS even once but FSR 2.0 does have shimmering I notice to various degrees. It was very noticable on fur in Ratchet & Clank cutscenes for example. Overall I am just happy my 5700xt could still keep up with 1440p.,Neutral
Intel,Hmm yeah whatever you want to believe and let's you sleep.  Have a nice day.,Positive
Intel,AMD CAS is aimed to restore detail,Neutral
Intel,"They aren’t chief proponents of anything, TAAU has been popular for well over a decade at this point and it’s the default approach for consoles (checkerboarding has moire and aliasing issues) and digital foundry simply recognizes this is the reality of how the console world has settled on doing graphics.",Neutral
Intel,The problem with Nvidia is they are massively overpriced. One 4080 would probably cost the same as my whole build or more.,Negative
Intel,"Yes I see which one looks better, and as I said before it's a static image. While I didn't use upscaling in this same exact example, I can go by my own experience and tell that it doesn't look better then native let's say in same Cyberpunk or any other game. And I will beleive my own eyes on my own screen then static images tossed around. TBH, in my opinion it all depends on screen and screen size too, as to me that difference between upscaled and native was less noticible on my old 27"" 1440p screen then it is now on 42"" 4k. DLAA tough, that's another story",Neutral
Intel,"I tried both, and neither of them are better then native as people tend to claim. In my testing FSR have big problem with smaller details like hair, fur, fences, powerlines and as you mentioned, you get severe shimmering effect. I really hope AMD will keep on working on it, an try to get away from that. But DLSS also adds shimmer, it's just less visible then in FSR (atleast in my testing on Cyberpunk pre 2.0), and whatever upscaling method I've used I also could see that image is upscaled (lower res textures here and there etc.). I like idea being upscaling tech, it helps prolong life of GPUs, and for more powerful GPUs to run higher settings with more fidelity, but there's still work to do on them as they aren't perfect yet.",Negative
Intel,Yeah but a 3060ti didn't,Neutral
Intel,"In Cyberpunk you are not comparing upscaling vs no upscaling at the same settings though. You are comparing low RT native vs path traced upscaling and at 4K, the decission there is absolutely clear. On my 4k OLED screen, upscaled PT is so clearly the way to go, there is no competition.",Neutral
Intel,"The gameplay looks exactly like the image + your typical TAA/DLSS smearing. And as I said, in my example DLSS also looks better in gameplay, because as you see... native has a ton of aliasing which is super noticeable while playing (shimmering). There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling. Talking about native is nonesense, just image quality counts and thats were DLSS or even FSR 2 (some games) gets better and better. There is a reason why consoles use it... it looks better than without it.",Positive
Intel,"If only Intel had stayed in the memory business!

Intel,"If Intel is really about to release a B770, honestly the **only thing that could make it competitive is the price**. (FOR ME, competitive in 2026 means <400€) From a performance standpoint, it would need to undercut existing GPUs quite aggressively to make sense, especially given how crowded the mid-range already is.  That said, I’m pretty skeptical about how realistic that is. **With the recent RAM shortages and rising memory costs**, pricing a new card competitively while still keeping margins doesn’t sound easy at all. Memory is a huge part of the BOM, and we’ve already seen how shortages can push prices up across the board.  So unless Intel is willing to take a serious hit on margins (which seems unlikely), I’m not convinced the B770 will land at a price point that truly shakes up the market. Happy to be proven wrong, but for now the pricing question is the big unknown for me.",Neutral
Intel,So there's a 20GB variant. A 28GB variant and a 32 GB variant?,Neutral
Intel,Optane was practically **built** for the type of AI workloads that they're shoveling money at.  If Intel didn't give up literally only a matter of months before GPT released and the bubble began in earnest lol,Neutral
Intel,"If Intel stayed in memory business, it would be long dead in the 80s and killed by Japanese memory companies. CPU remains the top niche area with less competition and deeper moat. See how China has quickly come up with their GPU designs? Well it will take at least another decade for them to make 2nm CPUs",Neutral
Intel,"are people high or something? intel was losing money on optane and their SSD business became irrelevant the minute regular memory manufacturers slammed the market. don't get me wrong, they were some of the most durable on the market, but they were no where near printing money on the memory business.  optane may have survived if their nodes were on schedule, keeping CXL support on schedule, but not because it was profitable.",Negative
Intel,"I feel like the price has to be more than competitive. If they can undercut competition cards of the same performance by 100 or so (or maybe offer rebates or freebies) they could potentially steal the market in that category. With Nvidia and amd cards being tried and true for many many years, I feel like their marketing needs to grab the attention of consumers in a somewhat drastic way.",Neutral

But as of now, we don't really have any information that directly points to a competing product.      In fact, I might be crazy but I feel like it is more likely that the actual answer to Strix Halo will be all Intel silicon, because Nvidia is very horny for all things ai and all things datacenter.",Neutral
Intel,"I mean no offense, but Passmark is irrelevant.  Even comparing the 890m to the 7600m (non-xt), the 7600m is usually twice as fast, with dips down to ~60% faster, and lifts up to ~170% faster.     NoteBookCheck has an extremely robust dataset of benchmarks in games for both the 890m and the 7600m (non-xt) at various resolutions, and they show not only a clear winner, but a very large difference in the performance of these devices.      Now I'm not trashing what the B390 will be, because we need an iGPU fight here.  But thinking that the 7600m (non-xt) is only ~15.7% faster than the B390 ((new-old)/old gives percent change) because of Passmark is erroneous.",Neutral

Intel,"14900KS is just a better binned 14900K. All things equal, you should have lower temps/voltage/power draw for the same exact workload/clocks on a 14900ks vs a 14900k. How big of a delta between the two comes down to how well you struck the silicon lottery with the KS.",Neutral

Intel,Why not keep pl2 at 253 and 1 at 150/185 ? Did you try undervolting? Most of them can take 50mv offset with 75 /85 needing a bit more stability testing. Can also cap the vr limit and iccmax.

Intel,"While I haven't used it daily or anything, and I've only done initial setup on the Lunar Lake, the feedback we've gotten both on Arrow Lake and for Lunar Lake (e.g. 268V and 265H) Dell models is that it's a big increase in battery life and performance. The integrated graphics (e.g. 140V and 140T) are very capable compared to a **workstation** grade NVIDIA Ada 500 GPU, but they are not even comparable to a gaming GPU like the GeForce 4060 or even a 5050.  The integrated graphics do however get used for 99% of all workloads unless explicitly specified because they are vastly more battery efficient and draw less power compared to a dedicated NVIDIA chip, meaning you can have a much smaller external power supply, and your graphics performance in those basic desktop workloads with one of these chipsets will be **much** better than previous generation Intel chips. Exceptions are obviously something like gaming or AutoCAD that specify to use the high performance dedicated graphics chip.  140V/140T are barely functional for modern AAA gaming, but if you stay 5-10 years back for AAA titles you might be okay. It will smoke most Indie games. Just look at the per title benchmarks for a 140V/140T and you can see if your game benches. You could probably get away with a lot of functional mobile gaming without a dGPU, but I wouldn't expect to be able to play a recent Call of Duty or Black Myth or anything with anything like an acceptable framerate at a decent resolution. This integrated graphics chip compares very favorably to its more common Ryzen 7 equivalent, I believe the 780M, and it's a very good APU for handhelds overall due Lunar Lake's power efficiency compared to other X86 chips.  You have to understand that for these next two generations Intel seems to be making big strides in terms of both power efficiency and integrated graphics for mobile, it's a very attractive option and the first time I've seriously considered a laptop without a dGPU. I think Panther Lake is going to be a very nice kit next year for both laptops and handhelds and give AMD a run for its money.   I suspect AMD genuinely needs a new APU graphics architecture implemented next year to keep up, which I expect them to. Not a bad problem to have.",Positive

Intel,"PTL's main changes are fixing MTL/ARL's terrible SoC design, which should net a few % performance. It'll see a mild IPC increase, getting a few more % performance. And it'll lose a bit of clockspeed, erasing most of those gains.  Expect PTL to be very similar performance to ARL, but with lower power consumption, a much better iGPU, and most importantly to Intel: Using their own fabs instead of TSMC.  It absolutely won't be X3D in gaming.  Edit: Actually shocked that people think this would compete with X3D.  9955HX3D is \~16% faster than a 275HX in gaming...and a 275HX itself is easily 10%+ faster than a 285H in gaming.  Not even Intel themselves are claiming this. Their own marketing refers to PTL as ""ARL performance with LNL efficiency"". Nobody realistically expects PTL-H to see a 25%+ gaming improvement over ARL-H. The fact that IPC increase is less than 10% and clockspeed is slightly lower than ARL-H should make this obvious",Neutral
Intel,CGC is a LNC tick. This is well known at this point. And we see it's even a clock speed regression.    Even entertaining the notion it will close the gap to AMD's X3D chips is just delusional.,Neutral

ARL-H will happily do 5.4 and 18A should clock decently, though I suppose that's a sacrifice for the 25W TDP.  I suspect these may not be totally final clocks though they do seem reasonable.",Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, surprised ARL-HX is doing as ok as it is. The deficits of the architecture in gaming are well known. If it could hit the same clocks and core counts, PTL should look a lot better still. And all that besides, ARL's cost structure is horrible. For Intel's own sake, the sooner they move on, the better.   > and 18A should clock decently, though I suppose that's a sacrifice for the 25W TDP  From the same leaker, these chips are at 65W or even 80W TDPs, so they're not merely power limited. It seems that 18A just significantly underperform some expectations, though in line with some rumors and the gist of the revisions Intel's been making to its projections over the last year or two.  > I suspect these may not be totally final clocks though  If they're defining SKUs and such, these clocks need to be finalized for all practical purposes.",Negative
Intel,"If I'm reading correctly those are max power limits, not the TDP,  though I get what you mean. The 285H sits at a 45W TDP and tops out at 115W. Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  As for why ARL HX is doing well in gaming laptops, I think a good bit of that is also part of what made it lackluster on desktop. It doesn't really scale up that well with higher TDPs and power limits, but it does seem to scale down. The 285HX with its 55W TDP and 160W max limit doesn't perform far off the 125W TDP and 250W max of the 285K.  It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system. The 9955HX3D is very impressive, but quite a lot of laptop buyers seem to value the ability to do more laptop-like things with their gaming laptops than the extra frame rate. I'm hoping this gets shaken up as AMD adopts new packaging tech as seen in Strix Halo.",Neutral

Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  Not guaranteed given it's just a twitter leak, but I'm assuming the leaker is using the term TDP consistently with Intel's historical usage, i.e. PL1. For ARL, 115W is PL2. I would also assume there wouldn't be the disclaimer about it being hard to cool if they cut the PL2 so much, though PowerVia does create some interesting complications there, so maybe not quite apples to apples.  Either way though, don't think it should have much impact on ST boost. You're talking a good 70%-ish of power going to compute, so even at 65W PL2, that's still 40-50W available for one core. Should be *easily* sufficient to hit whatever the silicon is capable of.  > It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system.  Yes, and this is something I've very much looking forward to with NVL-HX. At this point, the biggest demerit of the -HX platform vs -H is the use of standard DDR5 vs LPDDR. That's because it's still based on the desktop silicon with the different SoC/hub tile. But with NVL using a shared SoC die, they should be able to offer an -HX platform with the core counts people expect (though probably limited to single die 8+16), but the power/battery life advantages of -U/-P/-H. In general, should help make the -HX more of a straight-up upgrade than the tradeoffs one faces today.  AMD has this situation even worse today, because there's a much bigger gap between their desktop SoC architecture and the mobile one.

Well yes, if they cancel a project, and I know they have, I'll say they cancelled it. The way Intel can convince me to say otherwise is by... not cancelling projects. And you *do* realize they haven't talked about client dGPUs past BMG in many, many months, right? It's not like Intel's really denying anything.  I'm not sure what you're looking for here. Should I lie and pretend not to know what I do? To what end? It's not like Intel's harmed by me saying they cancelled such a project. That's not something you can keep a secret indefinitely, and anyone who *really* cares already knows.  > Also just look at job listings, there is many for gpu development.

Intel,"Intel have not claimed there to be upcoming Celestial, or more Battlemage or anything like it. How did their silence convince you of anything?",Negative
Intel,Actually after the Nvidia deal there's definite reason for Intel to cancel future ARC development.  They have a partner that makes better GPU than them. Why would they continue? If the Nvidia deal is successful I expect even their iGPU will disappear.  In no sense it makes sense to develop a line that's redundant with what your partner is doing.,Negative

Even then they like to delay the acknowledgement.",Negative
Intel,Think pretty easy naming. Any X infront just automatically means better iGPU,Positive
Intel,"Looks pretty snappy at \~75% faster than the top-end LNL chipset and this is with pre-release drivers.  Granted TDP is probably higher.

Intel,"Panther Lake 12 Xe3 performance looks great to match RTX 3050 laptop performance because the entire chip only draw half power of RTX 3050. Seems like using 18A BPD really paid of to reduce CPU consumption by a lot with the helps of Tsmc N3E for iGPU.    Also it's so weird to see Asus Zephyrus G14 with Intel chip, usually it always has Amd CPU paired with Nvidia GPU. I heard G14 is pretty popular gaming laptop but this laptop during full load can use 120w+ power.    Using Panther Lake 12 Xe3 will makes this laptop looks even more appealing because it reduces power requirements from 120w+ to 45w but still giving about the same GPU performance which is insane.

Intel,Intel wasn't a static target since the 10th gen. They've been pushing (at least in terms of performance) since then. It's mostly the efficiency which stepped back. And they messed up their current lineup in terms of performance and pricing but they've improved for sure.  Next gen seems good for them though. Hope they price it well. AMD isn't zen 1/2 either. They're bumping core numbers too and introducing some new cores as well.,Neutral

Intel,because 50% more cores need 50% more power for 50% more performance.,Neutral
Intel,"There are so many variables here that we have no way of accurately saying that.  It's possible that Xe3 is simply treated more like RDNA in this benchmark, and that the Xe2 140V is unfairly biased towards in that way. If that is the case, the 890M and 8060S may be better metrics to base off, and we do see over 50% gains for a 50% wider GPU than the 890M.  It's also possible this is a power-limited scenario. Like for like on TDP, this would be a solid improvement given the GPU both has to be moved off-tile compared to Lunar Lake, and has twice as many CPU cores to fight for power.  This could be pre-release drivers not getting the true 100% out of the hardware or silicon with non-final clocks still being tuned. The point is there's no way to know for sure.",Neutral

Intel,"they're keeping their jobs because this is technically better than the past. back in the day you'd have model numbers exclusive to a retail store, much less specific to an OEM, because businesses wanted to feel like they got a bespoke deal.   These days the SKU naming is mostly for accounting purposes, while the ""real"" naming decisions are made by the OEMs. basically most people are buying the Thinkpad/Yoga/ROG ""brand"" rather than the specific processor model, which only a much smaller crowd bothers to comprehend. It's like how people buy the Steamdeck rather than whatever APU is in there, which is fairly old at this point.",Neutral

AMD,Has AMD made any RDNA 4 GPUs for laptop?,Neutral
AMD,"AMD has to actually ship product (and support it) for OEM to use them.  There are other considerations, yes, but multiple manufacturers have publicly stated that AMD just doesn’t have enough available for them to warrant making more than a few models.  Nvidia on the other hand has more than enough capacity to guarantee deals so they can easily just stick with them for an entire product stack and simplify procurement.  (For dGPU products. Future of Nvidia’s business direction withstanding at the moment.)",Neutral
AMD,I imagine AMD don't commit the volume necessary to supply the OEMs   Look at the supply issues on the 9070/XT for most of the year. And the DIY market is small,Negative
AMD,"1. Nvidia has brand recognition and simply sells better.  2. Nvidia can guarantee OEMs as much supply as they can move. AMD discrete GPUs for laptops are as good as vapourware.  3. Nvidia GPUs are more efficient and that really matters in a laptop. AMD GPUs really struggle with idle power draw especially, so even before you start to run anything on them, you’re on the back foot  4. Nvidia has their entire laptop stack (with the exception of a couple of SKUs) available at launch. AMD drip feeds its launches so the hype doesn’t remain.  5. A massive proportion of gaming laptop buyers buy them to do work. Almost none of that works on AMD hardware. Their GPUs are straight up not supported in V-Ray and Corona. They absolutely suck in Blender. A 7900 XTX chugging 350W gets is arse handed to it by a 14 inch MacBook running on battery for example. Nvidia GPUs are better for video editing, especially with the new NVDEC of 50 series.   6. The value argument doesn’t hold for AMD laptop hardware. They have worse features and don’t tend to cost much less. And they all have the same VRAM anyway so that is also not a selling point.  TLDR: Because they are worse products and there is more nuance to the laptop market than there is to the DIY gaming desktop market.",Positive
AMD,"It's more likely due to AMD.    They simply don't ship that much volume and unlike nvidia who is constantly pushing volume of desktop GPUs, AMD seem to prefer the much more profitable AI/datacenter market.   Why integrate a worse, less efficient GPU at almost the same price?",Negative
AMD,"AMD isn't able to guarantee the same amount of supply as Nvidia (same situation with CPUs and Intel, although that's been improving)  And AMD has also been behind in terms of performance/watt since at *least* 2014, which is the most important metric by far when thinking about laptop GPUs.",Negative
AMD,Amd never released newer lineup this gen thats why.,Negative
AMD,Hard to ship something that doesn't exist,Negative
AMD,"They don't. AMD just hate the market for some reason and have never been good at supplying it.  Remember that a lot of laptop brands are largely made by a relatively small number of ODMs. Producing a modern laptop mainboard with discrete graphics is where an ODM leans heavily on their knowledge and relationship with Intel and Nvidia for circuit designs etc. Both companies are very focused on mobile and working with these ODMs. Both have a large lineup of products specifically engineered for mobile, AMD... not so much.  AMD hasn't been focused on mobile for a long time and ODMs have complained about the lack of relationship with the company, being left to figure stuff out themselves etc as far as putting together a mainboard featuring AMD products.  This generation they also just plain do not have the competitive products, there is no RDNA4 mobile chip which is strange. In the past there has also been complaints about inadequate supply of mobile dGPUs.",Negative

AMD,"1. AMD only has enough current mobile dgpu skus to count on 2 hands at most 2. AMD doesn't commit to actually shipping high volume of mobile parts 3. AMD tries to force ""AMD advantage"" with various hardware requirements that makes it a pain in the ass for OEMs to ship either cheap base models or use Intel cpus as an alternative if there is a shortage of AMD APUs.  No sane OEM is going to sell amd dgpus when they have min spec requirements for CPU, Memory, Storage, Screen, and wifi/bt.",Negative
AMD,"All these choices are done via the GPU maker’s business development team going and getting it done by selling into the laptop OEMs. The BD team is enabled by leadership committing manufacturing resources. It’s not like the laptop OEMs just go decide what to buy and put in the systems. I could also see the laptop OEMs going to the silicon companies and sharing “we have consumer demand for an AMD GPU, can you please make some available to us?”  In short, AMD either hasn’t made it a priority or they don’t have the capability. Or consumer demand doesn’t exist such that either party makes it happen.",Neutral

AMD,"The whole concept of the APU, AMD, and Intel to a lesser degree, are choosing to beef the iGPU in their APU to compete in the low and medium performance gaming laptops against the Nvidia dGPUs.  I personally have the theory that the handheld PCs were a proof of concept of how far AMD and Intel can take their APUs performance wise vs Nvidia discrete solutions in the mobile market.   AMD probably are thinking that if a single chip in the form of an APU can deliver a similar performance to two chips (CPU+dGPU) for 50-80% of the power budget, then they can corner the low and part of the medium performance gaming laptops market, after all you don't see a Nvidia dGPU in any of the current or future X86 handhelds, way too power hungry and ARM alternatives like the Tegra family fall considerably short, not to mention the still messy compability layer to run X86 games on ARM systems.",Neutral
AMD,Supply Issues is most likely   \#1 Reason  \#2 They don't sale.   Its the perfect combo of why bother. R&D isn't cheap you need to recoup cost at the bare minimal for what you put into the device being sold. Companies aren't going to do each other any favors anymore then they do a consumer a favor.,Negative
AMD,"AMD makes limited laptop level GPUs. Additionally, for laptops the market is a bit more split. If people want a gaming laptop, they generally really want a capable machine, and Nvidia has the more significant brand recognition there. If they don’t want that, they generally explicitly don’t want a dGPU. So as an OEM, it’s hard to justify the volume necessary to support an AMD SKU rather than just consolidate around an Nvidia line",Neutral
AMD,"I think that the APUs are pretty good for laptops, the RX6600M didn't really take off, I haven't seen any laptop with 7600. If they don't come with a 9060 non-XT for laptop now, then they never will.",Neutral
AMD,"Wondering the same thing, and I'd love to see an explanation.",Positive
AMD,"The key reason is just that Nvidia sells better. For an integrated product such as a laptop its very expensive to give consumers the choice, only for 90% of them to go with nvidia.   The technical aspects are not super important, because AMD did price some of their laptop GPUs aggressively to offset a hypothetical inferiority and almost nobody adopted it other than minisforum I think.   Its not a god situation for the market, its really nice to see framework making it flexible, but for many OEMs it seems just not worth it. The nvidia + Intel bundle situation might make it even worse for AMD in the laptop space in the future...",Neutral
AMD,"AMD doesn't have a mobile GPU lineup that has matched NVIDIA's for a while now (at least in the last 11 years), and what doesn't help is the efficiency at idle/low loads isn't great either which isn't a big deal in a desktop but much more important in a laptop, as you don't want heat to stick around in the laptop shell.

AMD,"They don't hate them, AMD GPUs simply SUCKS for what Laptop requires most  \#1 Reason: EFFICIENCY, Nvidia destroys AMD gpus in terms of efficiency, not even close, and efficiency is everything in laptop, even 10W higher could become a problem. Nvidia just draws so much less power at the same performance level for many generations already ever since the first RTX. The 5700XT draws the same power as 2080ti while being way slower and has no feature, 7900XTX consume more power than 4090 while being destroyed in everything, even newest 9070XT consumes about 100W higher than 5070Ti even though it's still slightly worse, this might not be relevant in PC at all, but for Laptop this is super crucial, and AMD completely failed at this. Not to mention idle power draw is a problem for AMD gpu.     \#2: Laptops are always meant for WORK and PRODUCTIVITY, not just gaming. If you want gaming only just build pc or get a console, but laptops have to be able to do as many productivity tasks as possible, that's what laptop is made for, a portable pc for work, even gaming laptop is made so that people can work and game on them, and AMD failed this aspect as well, Nvidia not only offer far better feature sets, but also simply work way better and compatible with everything, never need to workaround or tinkering, everything works with Nvidia gpu, and this is massive for laptop     These are the 2 biggest reasons, it's never about stocks or lack of volume that some clueless comments here suggest. That's why AMD thrives with Console instead, because consoles don't need neither of the reasons I mention above, console doesn't care about efficiency since they always plugged in, and console is for gaming only, never for anything else, so AMD has no problem fulfilling the massive volume of console Gpus, because for console use case AMD gpus make sense, unlike laptop",Negative

For a DIY enthusiast this is less of an issue, but for a system integrator/laptop manufacturer it means costs. Even the basic support request is a cost and you may have to service an entire system in case of a RMA, instead of just the dGPU for a DIYer.

AMD,"They still do. RX 7600 is slower than a 4060 and needs 40-50W more power to run. To compensate, AMD had to reduce CUs from 32 to 28 and reduce power draw.

AMD,This is so massively ignorant to talk about in the PC space. People do care... It's why Nvidia owns 92% of the PC graphic card market.  AMD has been struggling to sell it's products for ages in the GPU space... Both to end users and to board and laptop partners and it's not because they can't produce product...   APUs are AMDs future in the laptop market because AMD CPUs are unmatched in the x86 space. Strix Halo sells because the okay GPU is bolted onto world class leading CPUs.,Negative

AMD,"somehow they have enough silicon to make strix halo IO dies with an entire mobile GPU integrated into the SOC  it is definitely more deliberate, especially since mobile GPU chips are literally just desktop GPUs but in a mobile package and power limited",Negative
AMD,It's hard to judge rn because of AI dram production which definitely is gonna cut into some production for some of the process nodes. Ideally though you'd have thought they'd be at least well suited to gaming laptops with their lower power console focused development.   Especially considering their APUs are almost best in class at this point so you'd thought they'd at least have it down in the lighter laptop selections.

AMD,"AMD uses a single universal tapeout/photomask set to satisfy the vast majority of their entire desktop and server catalogues. Even a substantial proportion of AMD's available laptop offerings over the last 2 years have been -HX ones, which are just the desktop SKUs made into a solderable package. That's why it's always been relatively easy for them to maintain relatively consistent inventory, despite having far far fewer wafers coming in compared to what Intel can get.  The actual monolithic mobile SKUs are fundamentally different die designs to the other market segments. Strix Halo also uses a fundamentally different chiplet packaging method to server/desktop Zen, so neither the CCD or I/O die are compatible and makes it its own third, separate limited production assembly line.",Neutral

AMD,"Wouldn't call RDNA3 botched, it's just a price of doing chiplets.

AMD,"I can think of plenty that do, and it always comes down to the same two reasons.    1. They (for entirely selfish reasons, unrelated to work) travel between multiple locations and need access to GPU computing power, while away from their (home) office.   2. They don't understand remote compute and streamline decoding. While using the worst internet sources while on the go.   It's not that other, faster and more reliable solutions exist. It's that they are typically ADHD gremlins that need simple, reproducable solutions that work, even if it takes 500x longer and has stronger caveats.   It's not a market issue.

AMD,yes tech wise is why intel cpus are better. [https://imgur.com/a/CyxoUZM](https://imgur.com/a/CyxoUZM)  On paper the 9955hx and moreso the 9955hx3d look very good but in practice they fall short.   The 9955hx3d and 9955hx are simply lackluster in terms of battery life with the 275hx giving double the battery life and when unpluged the performance of the 9955hx/hx3d tanks which causes the 275hx to pull ahead when not plugged in. Additionally ryzen cpus have more sleep state issues which again hurts the battery life although that could be considered a windows problem and not on amd.   On top of this the intel chips have thunderbolt support and come with better wifi cards which amd refuses to use.   Then on the ultrabook side of things intel lunar lake is just better in terms of having lower powerdraw and a stronger igpu compared to AMDs lower power options although both intel and amd get smacked by ARM chips so not really that important unless you need x86,Positive
AMD,yeah I would say ARM chips are the best for most laptop users but for gaming you still want x86 at least for now.,Positive

AMD,Does AMD make things that go “woosh” when you need them to?,Neutral
AMD,Strix Halo is way too expensive and still sucks down too much while doing absolutely nothing.    OEMs find it cheaper just to use an Nvidia dGPU with any mobile CPU and the end result is an equivalent or better mobile product except in Cinebench and Blender. It's absolutely AMD's fault for making something that few people want.,Negative
AMD,You have to go ask amd why they don’t codesign laptop platforms with oems the way intel does with their evo platform. Nobody automatically deserves commercial success just because they exist. If intel invests money into oem platforms then that’s what amd must pay to do.,Neutral

AMD,">My 5090 goes from ~40W to 90W by just plugging in a second display while doing nothing  Yea that's not normal, 2 displays have been fine on nvidia cards for... well as long as I've had an nvidia card so 2017, to stay in idle memory speed state and it's only couple of watts more. Maybe if you go high enough it changes like two 4k240 displays or one/both being 1440p500, but 4k240 + 4k144 brief moment i had that combo didn't do it on a 4070ti and was fully idle state. Or you have some power settings cranked up maybe those effect things. Obviously interacting with like browser stuff with 2 high refresh/res monitors does have more brief spikes than a single panel would, but that's not idle.    3 is a bit of mixed bag, but even that it much better than it used to be like ~4-5 years ago, when 3 monitors of any kind was max memory speed state and can still get idle at 3 panels if the refresh rates of all panels isn't high and even then it might go to half memory speed state instead of full speed on some specific combo. I do remember some talk about how the specific model also might affect things due to... something, rather than just pure refresh/res combo. thought that was mainly for 3(+) panels where it mattered, but maybe that could be what's happening even with just 2 panels.",Neutral

It’s only recently (within three years) that Nvidia started releasing open source kernel drivers for their cards on Linux (because they moved their proprietary code into the device firmware). Prior to this (and even still) it wasn’t uncommon for Linux users to boot into a black screen after upgrade due to an Nvidia related problem.  This is different from large ML or HPC clusters which will use licensed drivers and CUDA libraries curated by someone like SUSE or RedHat for a hefty fee.

The problem is that the laptops that those chips go into often don't really care much about battery life at all. Desktop replacement/thick gaming laptops don't really prioritize battery life.   Even more so for the unplugged performance.   For the thinner gaming laptops that might, such as the Asus G16/G14, you see the -H series be used, or even LNL in that one experimental Acer laptop, an entire mobile class of CPUs you ignore in your comment.

The wifi card thing is a hardware thing because intel makes the better wifi cards and while they do have multiple chipset versions(one CNVio that only works with intel cpus and one non-CNVio) Amd still doesn't use them probably due to cost but also there are some driver/hardware issues as even the non-CNVIO Intel BE200 is known to have issues with AMD cpus,Neutral

AMD,"Even then you wouldn't though. AMD says the Max+ 395 can sustain 120W and boost upto 140W. That's not really much less than most 5060s do paired with a Ryzen 7 or Ultra 7.   I have an Omen Transcend 14 with a Meteor Lake Ultra 7 and a 4060. The total power budget for them is \~85W because the laptop is powered via a 140W USB-C power adaptor. The 4060 can pull upto 65W. The newer 5060 model can pull 75W because the CPU is more efficient. As a result, my laptop is slower than a full-power 4060 laptop.  But the same is also true for the ZBook Ultra G1A. Also a premium, high-performance 14"" HP. Also runs through a 140W USB-C power adaptor. Also has the same 85W power limit. Is also slower than the ROG Flow Z13 tablet that has a 180/200W power brick with 20-25W higher power budget. It is also not really faster than my laptop for the GPU.  Of course, the ZBook's CPU is a lot faster. I guess a more fair comparison in that sense would be the 385, but that has a slower GPU.   All of that would be fine until you realise that the ZBook costs a LOT more than the Omen and the laptops otherwise are very similar. Similar battery life, same OLED display, very similar keyboard, trackpad and speakers, similar build quality and general handling.",Neutral

That may be easy for me to say sitting on 64gb of a-die running tight timings, but you/I seriously don't need high end ram to build a pc and run games flat maxed out.

They recently released the 5500X3D for the Brazilian market in June, and the 5600F in others.   The biggest issue is there's only a handful of AM4 boards still for sales and DDR4 RAM in the retail channels is almost entirely gone. Sure you can find used RAM, but minting new products that requires parts that are no longer in production is suicide.

AMD,"Not only is it not likely for reasons of moving forward instead of back, you'd also crash the ""market"" the minute there's any supply, and it would likely spike prices on AM4 boards and DDR4 ram. The lack of demand is the only reason AM4 boards and DDR4 are relatively cheap right now. Can't get good AM4 CPUs, so the rest of the linked prices slump.

AMD,">It got me thinking, is 5000 series AM4 on an old enough node that AMD could restart production cheap? Cheap enough to sell a high end x3d chip to satisfy people holding on to their old platform and RAM while the shortage is happening?  Why this will probably never happen:  * The vast majority of people do not upgrade their CPU. The entusiaste market is probably less than 1%. There is not enough volume. * Selling this processor will cannibalize their own current product line. * The stacked L3 cache could be better utilized on their current CPUs. * All fab production is concentrated on storage, ram, new CPUs and GPUs. New and Old.  The echo chamber that is PC enthusiasts has seriously distorted their perception of the PC market.",Negative
AMD,Before the AI bubble I would have said no way. With the AI bubble making new unaffordable for the next 12-18 months at a minimum I'd say maybe.  People on AM4 aren't going to buy AM5 if they have to spend 200% of their budget to get it. DDR5 RAM prices are really going to cripple the PCbuild industry for the next year.,Negative
AMD,"There was some rumors that Zen4 was originally going to come to AM4. They could still do it. Maybe a lot of that work is already done. I'm skeptical there is still much DDR4 in production, and it'll soon all be gone. What we got on desktop was mostly left over stuff that servers didn't want. I don't think they would make these CPUs just for consumer when there is so much more profit in putting that silicon towards servers. If Mircon abandoned Crucial memory for consumers, that to me says a lot about where the real focus is for hardware makers. AMD right now just doesn't care much about desktop anything.",Neutral

So that would be a way for AMD to keep selling CPUs to existing AM4 users of whom they otherwise wouldn’t make money from.",Positive
AMD,"From one side Zen 6 has to sell but RAM/(SSD) prices may block AM4 to AM5 upgrades (how many still on AM4?). Then if going AM5 is to expensive then people may wait till Zen 7 which may be AM6 and if it's revealed early that Zen 7 is AM6 then it will decrease AM5 interest even more.  Zen 6 will launch ""late"" 2026, so 2027 is the year it will be in mass availability. RAM prices may be more sane at that time. Especially when people will be waiting for X3D (if the base variants get rekt again by existing X3Ds).  Refresh of 5800X3D wouldn't hurt but I doubt they would be offer more without a longer development cycle (a new design) after which it may turn out it's all for nothing.",Neutral

They're still gonna be making lots of money on all this AI stuff themselves selling CPU's and GPU's, they can take hit on the consumer side for a bit.    I also think paying high prices for AM4 processors is very stupid.

In any case anyone building \*now\* can still get a 7500F which will out perform any AM4 CPU for $150, paired with whatever mobo is cheapest and JEDEC tier ram, then upgrade the CPU and ram in the future and be sitting pretty. Fab space is booked up for years solid, scheduling a brand new run specifically for people who missed the boat on a cheap drop in AM4 life extension isn't going to happen and wouldn't be economical for anyone if it did.  Also, are you aware you can currently just get a 5900x from ali for $250 all in?

And would it be profitable for AMD to release it at prices that you and others wouldn't consider prohibitively expensive?  I took a quick look at ebay, and it looks like the 5800x3d is going for just under $500, and the 5700x3d just under $350.

AMD,"Yeah exactly, they were all the ""bad"" 5600X3D yields which are all just 5700X or 5800X bad yields too slapped with an 3D V-Cache die on top. In no world is AMD going to TSMC and purchasing wafers to make exclusively 5500X3Ds or any other old chip. They especially wouldn't bother purchasing wafers for some transient rise in DDR5 and to give customers on older platforms upgrade options. It also takes years to do that sort of stuff and thats using old process nodes and architectures.  Even backporting a new architecture to an old platform would require re-validating for a new platform and for DDR4 memory now, getting partners to release BIOS updates and to get them on board etc. It's not that simple to just move Zen6 to AM4 for instance by replacing an I/O die and calling it a day. I can't imagine AIBs being happy about losing new motherboard sales either.",Negative
AMD,They will only use ddr6 because it's much better but current producers will keep making ddr5 for a while because it's in demand and will sell. It's only a problem because we stopped making ddr4 because there wasn't much demand for it once ddr5 was cheap and widely available. If this crunch happened last year before ddr4 production was wound down it wouldn't be a huge problem either. This is the worst timing.,Neutral

AMD,X3D is a separate production line with its' own constraints. There is limited packaging available for X3D that is not shared with the normal SKUs.  X3D being EOL is not tied to the normal Zen 3 SKUs. The normal SKUs they can shurn out as long as there is demand from both server and desktop.  X3D however might very well be supply constrained.

Upgrading to something like a Ryzen 5500, 5600 or 5700X on a cheap B450 or B550 board is a huge upgrade for very little cash, and they spend $0 on RAM as they're reusing what they already have.",Negative

You'd be hard pressed to find anyone with 32GB of RAM on AM4 really in their old systems if they're still using them. 32GB really only became very prolific with AM5 and Z690 thanks to DDR5 density.

On MacOS it runs natively in AV1 with Cloud GSync, there's virtually no lag and even in very dark scenes you can barely tell it's a stream.

Maybe if TSMC is counting A16 as a complete node jump, rather than what it sounds like as N2 with BSPD being only meaningful for HPC.  Problem is, and this applies to both Samsung and Intel, is if remaining what is realistically N-1 in 2027 is still enough for Samsung and Intel to actually benefit. Because I don't think the nodes they will have available then are going to be much better than the N3 family either.  >while Google’s TPU team reportedly visited the Taylor fab to discuss potential production volumes, as the search engine leader is currently moving to sell TPUs—previously used exclusively for internal workloads—to external customers such as Meta.  I would be very surprised if this is true, precisely because the reporting that Google is looking to sell TPUs to external customers, and still want to use what will likely be an inferior node to what other customers/competition may end up using on TSMC.  It's one thing to use a lower end node or less competitive processor for your own internal workloads, where the cost you save remaining internal can offset the disadvantages. It's different when you have to then turn around and sell that to external customers and make it worth it for them too though.",Neutral

I don't really care about the upscaling part of it, the 6800 chewed up any game i threw at it at 1440p without RT. I wanted it because TAA or FSR3 are horrid when it comes to image quality when you use them as AA solutions.   Playing something like Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth was a travesty if using TAA or FSR 3. Such a beautiful game that looks like a smudged mess with those solutions.  So i got an Nvidia 5080 for black friday sales. I basically just don't trust AMD's GPU division to not abandon even their 9000 series once they release a new series. And i'm done giving money to a  company division that is content in merely keeping their cards in ""Nvidia -50$"" price range for much lower feature sets.  I HATE AND LOATHE Nvidia as a corporation and hate that i gave them money, but i ultimately just picked the better product for my needs.

AMD,"> What's misleading about this? Nvidia specifically marketed their GPUs as ""4x"" performance or whatever and compared GPUs with FG/DLSS off with DLSS and FG on. These charts from AMD are specifically performance charts for FSR which means the point is FG performance.  What's misleading is they're making out that the FPS you're getting is more performance and making the game ""faster"" (says it in the top right of the chart, their words not mine), yet the latency is increased and delays inputs, that's anything but faster or more responsive gameplay. If this was just upscaling I would have no problem, but as I said, once you start adding Frame Gen as ""performance"" and making the game a less responsive experience, it's not faster, you're delaying inputs for perceived smoothness in the image. Both practices are dumb and misleading and I do not advocate for either what NVIDIA or Radeon have done with marketing their products. What NVIDIA has done is worse, but go to the root of both marketing strategies and both AMD and NVIDIA are pretending like Frame Generation = more responsive and more/faster performance.",Negative

It works pretty good already, which makes AMD's reticence to put it out officially *baffling* -- especially since they aren't putting RDNA4 into APUs for a while yet, and want to sell a bunch of those in gaming-focused handhelds and Steam Machines.  AMD has a good software product here for once and they need a broad installed base to drive developer adoption, but they don't seem to care and it's infuriating.",Positive

AMD,"4x frame gen is really niche, there are so few cases where it actually makes sense and doesn't cause an unacceptable amount of artifacting and/or latency. You pretty much need a 240hz+ monitor, for one thing. I don't imagine that being a major factor in almost anyone's purchase decision.",Negative
AMD,"4x FG is a gimmick at this point. Maybe FG progresses to the point that it's viable in the future, but it really isn't right now.",Neutral
AMD,Yeah that's fair. Windows loves to replace new drivers with shitty old ones against your will.,Negative
AMD,"The fact that the INT8 version got leaked the way it did says...something.  It is pure speculation at this point by anyone except AMDs management as to why they have not released drivers that include INT8 for older RDNA versions but I think based on the independent testing from that leaked version that not officially releasing it is bad.  It is one thing to want to sell new cards but it is quite another to have something like the INT8 be out in the wild and then try to ignore its existence for the owners of cards not really that old.  And given how they recently they tried to put cards that they still sell into ""maintenance mode"" it really does seem like some parts of AMDs management is not making good decisions for their customers.  Now maybe their data shows that such decisions are better for their quarter to quarter bottom line but I really do question if that is the case.  I'd have to see some *hard* data to prove to me that whatever additional profits they are making but implementing these decisions are adding value to the company/brand over these anti-customer moves.",Negative
AMD,"It's pure market segmentation. Even if it doesn't work the same, they could still allow older cards to get it.",Neutral
AMD,People use fsr3 to play at higher frame rates. So why would they release something that almost entirely fails to do that on the most sold gpus which are the low end 6600s and 7600s?,Negative
AMD,"It runs, but performance impact is considerable and inconsistent and quality isn't on par with FP8 either, no?   Could be they decided against releasing it in this state because of it.",Negative

AMD,My 280X survived until Overwatch 2.,Neutral
AMD,"I have had enough discussions with them, and the thing they call driver is adrenaline software which is driver control panel, clearly not understanding what a driver is.",Negative
AMD,The only benefit I can think of is maybe better motion clarity by pushing the FPS to 200+ or something if you have a really good monitor (i.e. an OLED). But even then the hit on latency means it would only work well for games where latency is not hugely important.,Neutral
AMD,"If I recall, the main harshness on Nvidia was the way they were trying to push reviewers to only review performance with frame generation enabled, an inherently dishonest take.  To be fair, I also haven't seen the video on this yet either, but I think ""frame gen generally sucks in these ways"" is pretty well established and those factors are unlikely to change drastically",Negative
AMD,"I saw first 3 minutes, he did said he didn't had much time for this video  but still doesn't excuse the ""less harsh"" opinion on amd.  Will update this after watching whole video",Neutral

AMD,"I wish they would.  Isn't the NPU in the 90x0 an XDNA also?  That's what is doing this upscaling.  But, who knows if Windows is locking it down for CoPilot, or if it is accessible in the same way as the one in the GPU (since it is technically part of the CPU).  I bet they will figure it out though.  With Intel about to release their own competitor to it (maybe... no GPU benchmarks yet), they will want to use all they have to combat it.",Neutral

AMD,Performant impact isn't that considerable.  It's consistent.  Quality is almost identical.,Neutral
AMD,"Because it was already developed, exists, and all they had to do to get the easy win was launch it officially.   But they chose not to do so while still making every APU including $1500+ Strix Halo products that could use it their only option.",Neutral
AMD,"It’s a bit more complicated. Krackan point/Strix Point are APUs, is everything on the same chip so… why not?  Also I’m on Linux, firmware/drivers are there but there is no program/frameworks using them… So it’s purely a drivers issue from amdgpu to actually schedule compute on the NPU.",Neutral
AMD,You guys say this but people still consider FG a gimmick despite FSR3 supporting FG for years now (and doing a decent job with it too tbh unlike the upscaler).,Neutral
AMD,Not every negative Nvidia comment is a pro-AMD comment. Stop promoting tribalism for 2 giga-corporations that don't give a shit about you.  I genuinely don't think 4x FG is a valuable feature at this time. The latency hit and the image degradation are not worth the smoothness.,Negative
AMD,"I really expected them to announce an MFG, you know damn well that they must have been working on it since the moment they caught wind of Nvidia having it.

AMD,"You think shareholders are going to like that old product is cannibalizing new? This is exactly what happened with the 1080 Ti.  Sure, it's irrational from a consumer and engineer perspective, but nobody cares about them. They only care about the shareholders.",Negative
AMD,Doe dlss transformer only give 5 extra fps on a 2050?  And path tracing is designed to look good not help games run better. Your example would make sense if there was somehow less light bounce than in rasterized modes.  Fsr4 on rdna3 fundamentally fails at the thing its most used for.,Negative
AMD,"The xdna npu is a completely different architecture (based on xilinx IP) than the rdna4 ml extensions, which are a set of new shader instructions.  They don't really have anything in common in terms of architecture, I'd be surprised if the amdgpu driver ever ""supports"" both, as it'll be effectively adding an entire new driver stack beneath that interface for the npu, and much of that interface would simply be not relevant to the npu (and likely the npu will need new interfaces that aren't relevant to the GPU side of things either). It'll just be functionally 2 different drivers sharing a name.",Neutral
AMD,"Neither of the things you mentioned are even remotely true. Latency hit is negligible if you're close to base FPS of 60 or higher, Nvidia Reflex is far far better than AMD's Anti lag. And Reflex 2 will kill the latency debate with FG once and for all.  And personally I haven't noticed any image quality issues either. The FG model they trained is very good. It's an amazing technology for me, I have a 360 Hz OLED monitor and it's sublime to game in the  200-360 FPS range.   Also let's not pretend to not know fans of which corporate, Intel, Nvidia or AMD represents a literal cult.",Neutral
AMD,"Lol, the 'shareholders' do not care about Radeon consumer products. Most AMD shareholders probably aren't even fully aware of these DIY discrete GPUs, they are a rounding error in the business.  The amount of sales lost to people buying RDNA3 over RDNA4 due to FSR4 is essentially $0 in the grand scheme.",Negative

AMD,"Money  Making GPU tech from scratch is stupidly hard. And it’s going to be hot garbage for a few generations until you polish it.  Look at Intel, despite making iGPUs for decades, still had tons of trouble making decent architecture for performance.   Qualcomm bought their GPU tech from AMD (was ATI back then).  Apple managed to do it, but I bet they were working internally for a few iterations before it was good enough to ship.   Just licence the GPU and not reinvent the wheel if you don’t need too.",Negative
AMD,"Apple didn't make their own gpu from scratch tho. It's more like a custom power vr gpu in it's first iterations. The first ""custom"" apple gpu is a power vr gpu with ""image block"".

AMD,The frametime issues are truly catastrophic. Looks worse than when I would force Crossfire on games that didn't support it even. I don't understand why they thought it was a high-quality release to represent the brand. WTF man.   At least it looks good and they can theoretically fix the frame pacing. They never did on FSR 3.,Negative

AMD,"What confuses me about this is that the framerate and frametime graphs displayed by MSI Afterburner in many games tend to not be flat with DLSS-FG on my 4090. In fact, FSR-FG often appears flatter. However, the DLSS-FG tends to subjectively feel smooth to me (so long as it's not inheriting stutter from the rendered frames).  Does anyone have any explanations for this in light of the HUB and DF videos? Could the flip metering hardware of the 50 series be playing a significant role here (I think both HUB and DF used 50 series cards to compare FSR Redstone to)? Is there an issue with using MSI Afterburner's framerate and frametime graphs for this purpose (I can't seem to post a screenshot unfortunately)?",Neutral

AMD,"Yeah, I think in Digital Foundry's podcast they called out the Hardware Unboxed content as excellent and basically said ""I am not sure we even need to make a video now, but we will"".  And I think it's good that they did, more attention on this can only be a good thing.",Positive
AMD,"They will fix it in RDNA5, just like how adding frame generation was a “fix” for FSR3 and it being limited to RDNA4",Neutral
AMD,It might be an unfixable hardware flaw.,Negative
AMD,Why urgently? It's an optional feature.,Negative
AMD,"The ""time in the oven"" is releasing the feature in RDNA5, not in RDNA4. Just like how frame generation was a demo feature for RDNA3, Redstone is a demo feature for RDNA4 with the real version in RDNA5.",Neutral
AMD,Nvidia did it by adding ML hardware support to cards well before they were needed with the RTX 2xxx cards. It's surprising AMD waited so long to do it. They must have thought traditional algorithms would work just fine.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah seems so. However, if they have to spend more engineering time/power on improving advanced features I would expect porting them to the older gens is pushed further down the timeline.",Neutral
AMD,What did you expect though? It’s AMD. Their software is always a couple years behind.,Neutral
AMD,Don’t they have flip metering on RDNA 4?,Neutral
AMD,"it's not flawless, unfortunately. for some games though. yes, it's miles better than FS FG, but there is still room to improvements  take Indiana Jones with path tracing for max GPU load, take RTX 5090, run it with 4xFG without frame cap and check msbetweendisplaychange with capframex. it will have the same sawtooth graph with some short lived frames, but to a lesser degree ofc. it will be very noticeable to the naked eye on OLED monitors because they will flicker due to those variations  reflex by itself (and reflex is forced on when FG is used) also adds not so perfect frametimes that can be seen with msbetweendisplaychange in some heavy games (Cyberpunk 2077 would be another example)",Neutral
AMD,"Has anyone done some god quality testing on the frame pacing of no flip metering vs flip metering? The only such coverage I recall finding is this is [this Gamers Nexus clip](https://youtu.be/Nh1FHR9fkJk?t=1922), but they only tested this on two games, and only one of the two showed an obvious framepacing improvement from the 4090 to the 5090.",Neutral
AMD,"Someone should remind them of that old adage: ""Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.""",Neutral
AMD,"Unfortunately, this only solves the tearing issue, but doesn't completely address the frame pacing issue. It also deprives us of the low latency benefits of Antilag2 and adds a sync delay, although not as significant as without the frame rate cap. The increase in latency can be easily verified using the reflex monitoring built into the Optical scaler.",Negative
AMD,"There are different statistics that you can use to populate your frame time graph, each of which are valid depending on what you’re trying to show.   Pure frame time measurement, as in “this is how long it takes to process each frame” is valid. But so is ‘ms between presents’ and ‘ms between display change’, the first being the timing of the frames being presented to the render queue, and the latter being the rate that the actual display updates and shows the new frame. Both of these measurements are captured by presentmon and frameview. I’m not sure exactly what measurement afterburner uses, but I suspect they are measuring pure frame time. But if you looked at time between display change it would probably show the issues that hardware unboxed and digital foundry showed.",Neutral

Offloads video frame scheduling to the GPU 2. Saves CPU power for video playback  I don't think it has a role in frame generation, or even gaming, I think it mostly has to do with video playback.  Maybe it is the same thing and Redstone is just bad at frame pacing anyways?",Neutral
AMD,"As someone who came from a 40 to 50 series GPU, I can tell you it's amazing. It literally fixed VRR flickers for me and the pacing is flawless. The effect is exacerbated if you have an OLED display as it has near instant pixel response time.   The end result is a flicker-free smooth gameplay. It's hard to explain but it feels like I'm playing games on a thin fabric, it's that good.   So if anyone's on an OLED and hates bad frame pacing with VRR flickers, upgrading to a Blackwell GPU is the way to go, thanks to its HW flip metering logic.",Positive
AMD,I can only talk from personal experience but I have a 40 and 50 series gpu   I find Frame gen literally unusable on the 40 series card whereas I can literally not tell it is on with the 50 series   It felt like fucking magic to me   The 50 series is also a lot faster overall but I went up to 4K at the same time and am getting less frames so it’s not just more performance,Negative

AMD,"> But so is ‘ms between presents’ and ‘ms between display change’, the first being the timing of the frames being presented to the render queue, and the latter being the rate that the actual display updates and shows the new frame.  So I take it that the former is the time between frames entering a queue of frames to be sent to the monitor, while the latter is the time between those frames actually being sent to the monitor?  Anyways, I installed PresentMon, and using various metrics:  - FrameTime-Display - FrameTime-Presents - FrameTime-App - Ms Between Display Change  I couldn't notice any difference in these graphs between DLSS-FG and FSR-FG in Cyberpunk and Avatar (This is on 40 series, so no flip metering). With MSI Afterburner, the lines for both framerate and frametime appeared much flatter for FSR-FG in both games (even though it didn't subjectively feel smoother than DLSS-FG to me).  At times, FSR-FG has felt noticeably _less_ smooth than DLSS-FG in Avatar, but they both felt about the same on this particular occasion.  Others are reporting that DLSS-FG felt much smoother to them after upgrading from 40-series to 50-series, so I wonder if DLSS-FG isn't much smoother than FSR-FG on the 40 series. Also, I wonder if some of the FSR-FG framepacing issues are inconsistent, getting okay-ish frametimes on some occasions, but othertimes getting awful frametimes in the same game.",Neutral

AMD,"Friend - they'd reduce production on top tier as  * AMD doesn't compete on that level * their OEM numbers are probably 60-65% of their volume  If anything, they will pump out 6060s to keep AMD out of Steam Surveys since the die will be miniscule thus high yield per wafer, in consumer eyes, and most important - in affordable products thus increasing their user base and indirectly influence.  They can afford for 6090 tier buyers to eat the cost - as they've done willingly for halo GPUs since reviews existed.",Neutral
AMD,Chip yields increase exponentially as area is reduced linearly. They will try to sell traditionally 50-tier sized chips in 70-tier cards and be not much less profitable than the huge AI chips while hedging against the bubble popping.  They could also do another generation of dual fabs where Samsung or even Intel produces consumer chips while TSMC fabs for their data centre designs.,Neutral

I'd get a new GPU to step up to 144fps and that requires both upscaling and frame gen, actually I could do without ray tracing but the reason to have a >60fps display is that frame gen is supposed to be ok at higher frame rates.

That said, there are going to be Zen 6 EPYC SKUs that use different chiplets (there are at least two chiplet variants).  So it is possible that ""Venice"" is referring to a family of CPUs and there could be some Samsung based SKU in there.  But I think it is more likely that this headline is wrong, and AMD is contemplating Samsung for a different product.",Neutral
AMD,If i had to guess AMD is probably looking to offload lower end and mobile SKU's to Samsung to save on costs and get more TSMC production dedicated to more important datacenter/mainstream silicon. so Samsung might take over APU silicon for desktop and mobile along with motherboard chipsets and maybe some entry level desktop GPU's and most laptop GPU's.,Neutral

AMD,"FWIW that is not necessarily how prices are negotiated between designers and foundries.   The roadmap has more effect, and TSMC, Samsung, or Intel being in the picture is rarely used to drive prices lower.   Sure competition among fabs and packagers may set the ballpark of costs. But designers rarely use the threat of going with a different process to get a lower/better price from TSMC, Samsung, etc.   If AMD is going w Samsung it is likely because Samsung's roadmap may align w AMD requirements for a specific design.   The reason why this news may be unlikely is that AMD does not have an stablished silicon team with Samsung (that I am aware of). And that usually is how you can tell any type of significant volume from a large design team is going to be on a given foundry.   However Samsung does have a very nice roadmap for the type of large dies AMD has in their pipeline for their monolithic SoCs (mainly their APUs and GPUs). So there could be some alignment there.

AMD,"> It definitely feels like an ego thing that they didn't just copy Ryzen's super successful and ultimately quite straightforward chiplet scaling strategy.  Well, I think Intel at least *tried* to copy AMD's chiplet-paradigm helplessly for the last couple of years …  It seems that Intel was taken totally by surprise on anything Chiplets and got caught with their pants down (again), when AMD brought it this quick to market, when having worked on them for a decade plus.  Though IF Intel would already worked on anything *disintegrated silicon* for said 10 years by then (like Intel claimed when announcing their heterogenous '*Mix and Match*'-approach around 2018), *Intel would* ***not*** *have needed +6 years for finally reaching a fairly comparable design-approach* only half a decade later in 2023 with Meteor&nbsp;Lake (also Arrow Lake, Sapphire Rapids, Ponte Vecchio).  Since sure enough, all these disintegrated designs \*somehow\* brought Intel truly massive troubles engineering-wise and they had tremendous difficulties to overcome those for years — The years-long horror-stories over validation and dead-on silicon past tape-outs on *Sapphire Rapids* and *Ponte Vecchio* for example are testament to that … *Meteor Lake* was also everything but a performer.  ---- The issue at hand for Intel was quite many-layered …  * Intel hardly knew how to do it (despite claiming otherwise for years). *Shocker!*  * Intel had no real equivalent to AMD's SuperGlue aka *Infinity&nbsp;Fabric*™   That's for sure the most striking one, obviously — The reason they had to wait for PCi-E 5.0 to become a thing, for ""Intel's"" *CXL* to finalize upon it (which in itself is basically just AMD's former *CCIX* in disguise as Copy-pasta anyway done out of spite).  * Intel haven't remotely had adopted a design-strategy by then, which would've offered so to speak ""intelligent"" chiplets/tiles, which could be freely thrown together randomly at will on a (PCi-E) bus (which AMD actually evidently can with their CCX and I/O-dies since ages).  So Intel's claims before the press in 2018, of already working on disintegrated silicon since years already (and that AMD *weren't* actually as spearheading as they became), was pure virtue-signaling, a blatant lie.  As a result, Intel's IP-blocks still remained virtually *dumb* (in the sense of *head*|*less*) for years on out afterwards and most of it had to be *re-engineered from scratch* in all this other trouble like lay-offs, down-sizing or Intel's road-maps being constantly thrown out again (only to start over once more).  The reason why AMD had a years-long edge on chiplets from the onset, was since Intel just couldn't place or handle the stuff as ***independent*** *IP-blocks* — Everything was grown intercoupled and -linked together.  AMD on the other hand already had a decade-long headstart, due to their already well-tuned modular concept of IP-blocks (building-block principle with IP-blocks to freely chose from) attuned for the console-era from back then for the console-contracts (those, Intel always made fun of since).  So Intel allegedly been working on chiplet-esque designs for years already, was utter bullsh!t, and that's actually the sole reason WHY Intel struggled so hard for years with anything Tiles — They started at 0.",Neutral
AMD,"> It definitely feels like an ego thing …  Well, yeah. It definitely IS a ego-thing for Intel — They called them *Tiles* purely out of spite.  Since you can't just call basically the very same what your competitor has, the same name, can you?   That's not how Intel rolls nor would have ever done anyway, even if doing so, would've saves them a lot of engineering-pain in the arse, even more teething-problems and cost them years of falling back behind their only lone competitor …  Truth be told, Intel's *Tiles* are basically in essence just Copy-Pasta: *A botched Copy'nPaste-job from AMD's chiplets*, yet relabeled as 'Tiles', just for Intel trying to pretend to have their ""own"" chiplet-esque implementation, even if it's basically the very same …  Wanna hear a joke? When Intel back then around 2018 out of the blue announced their heterogenous *Mix and Match*-stuff (pretending, they'd already worked a decade on this by then), [the actual effing PowerPoint-slides actually didn't even incorporated anything called 'Tiles']( http://web.archive.org/web/20210923105815/https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/monolithic-vs-heterogeneous-infographic.pdf) — *Called them* ***chiplets****!*  Yet some big weak weasel's ego was hurt in Santa Clara, and they renamed it *Tiles* shortly afterwards.  > … just copy Ryzen's super successful and ultimately quite straightforward chiplet-scaling strategy.  They joke is, due to both of them share a cross-patent agreement, Intel even would've had access to AMD's patented stuff over everything chiplets — Chances are Santa Clara chose not to over license-fees, or spite …  *That's how you're f–cked over by your own ego* — Rather throw years of potential lead into the gutter, instead of even *thinking* about having to share some meager percentage of profits of yours with others.

AMD,"You don't have to lock in your foundry choice 3 years in advance, but 2 years is pretty close.  Three years in advance, you are kicking the tires on the PDK and making sure the node will achieve your goals for your design.  That is not so expensive you cannot do it for multiple foundries.  The next step, is finalizing the layout for masks, which culminates in the tape-out.  You could do that for multiple processes, but it does not make much sense, as you should have known which process you prefer before that step.  Masks are very expensive so you don't want to make them for two different processes.  So tape out is the last chance you have to make a foundry decision, but you should make it months before that.  As an example, AMD announced back in April that Venice chiplets taped out on TSMC 2nm.  Venice is going to be included in Helios racks that are being delivered in Q3 next year.  So maybe a little less than 1.5 years from tapeout to product.  Add in the time for doing the physical layout, and you get pretty close to 2 years.

It's 1–2 years in advance, if it takes that long.  Also, it's not that AMD (just like others like nVidia, Broadcom, Qualcomm et al) aren't used to foundry-hopping since decades due to the short cadences of GPU- and CPU-release cycles — *They all have extremely well-attuned process-tailored teams for such foundry-stuff, speeding up things massively*.  Taking GPUs as an example, these are AMD- and Nvidia-teams of hundreds to thousands of process-engineers, VLSI-magicians and all kind of specialists for EDA-tooling and whatnot else is needed, working closely on-site directly at foundries like TSMC, Samsung or GlobalFoundries and interoperate with the foundry's respective specialists for stuff like that …  So given the current time-line at end of 2025, it would be *virtually two full years* up to it, until a launch scheduled for end of 2027, which ought to be pretty sufficient and timely fitting — Pretty realistic if you ask me.",Neutral

I'd just see it as a repeat/extension of the first Ryzen-launch — AMD not just adopted a two-pronged approach back then with the original-Ryzen in 2017 (TSMC, Samsung), they even opted for *a three-pronged strategy* (TSMC, Samsung, GlobalFoundries) for a single design of their CCXs (Ryzen, Threadripper, Epyc) …  Still wasn't enough to satisfy demand anyway — Limited availability, as markets just gobbled up ALL of it in months.",Neutral
AMD,"That's not how it works.  You don't just bring a design to a silicon foundry the way you bring a blueprint to a factory.  You have to create the design using that foundry's software tools.  If AMD uses Samsung as a second source, that means they re-created the low-level design for Samsung from scratch.  None of the people who created the TSMC design would be legally allowed to take part.  That leaves Samsung-specific employees and the broader design team that creates the higher-level design.  It is true, of course, that there's nothing special about an x86 chip versus some other chip.  The point is, Samsung just runs the process.  AMD has to design the chip on that process, with assistance from Samsung being limited to issues well outside the scope of the high-level chip design.",Neutral

You really become a pain in the butt with this sh!t over AI-stuff — *Just because I use hyphens?!*  You can browse my comment-history, and you'd see, that I'd quite likely already used hyphens on my first comments ever made here on Reddit about 8 years ago (a time, when AI wasn't even existing). It's a style of writing for me ever since I use since like two or three decades, as I got used to it, as many are from the scientific/technical-driven realms.  ---- And talking about y'all imbecile reasoning over em-dashes (or en-dashes for that matter); Did it ever occur to you, that using em-/en-dashes is actually quite common, actually often mandatory in the scientific field of applied since?!

Meanwhile a en-dash (–) is used for date-formats in everyday life and money-values et al and so forth.  In any case, in print media (newspaper, books, scientific works), dashes are heavily used, in the field of typography even as a stylistic element … and if you would've cared to look at the way I wrote my post;  I usually try to write while trying to maintain a pleasing appearance for *ease of reasoning*, and dashes tremendously help with that, that's also why I use horizontal rulers within posts (differentiate separate issues).

AMD,"> I'm reasonably sure Samsung has never manufactured any x86 chips. Intel did use them for chipsets in the past, but not processors.  That's not true. Just because Intel never \*admitted\* it publicly (so save face and protect their golden cow, their stock), doesn't mean, Intel never outsourced before — They did in fact, and they did in fact *en masse* for years …  Since back then during the self-inflicted 14nm-shortages (Meltdown, Spectre, Foreshadow; also 10nm-issues), Intel's CEO Bob Swan reshuffled much capacity and brought over almost all chipsets to Samsung being fabbed there.

No, with all due respect, but that's pure nonsense — All throughout the time of Intel pumping the mobile market with Atoms (2007-2013, fighting the myriad of ARM-licensees like Samsung, Qualcomm, MediaTek), these very Atoms (especially each and all for the mobile market), have been made *virtually exclusively by TSMC* for several years in a row (and NOT Intel itself) since at least 2009.  True be told, I'm not even aware if Intel ever manufactured their own Atoms ever again past first Gen Atoms (Silverthorne) in 2008, when they basically showed over their whole Atom-business to TSMC for several years.

This was done fully *strategically*, as it would've signalled an actual *admission of struggling and falling behind* (and necessarily having to contract outsiders), which Intel has been desperately trying to avoid for years on end since 2012 or so and through-out the whole fiasco of their 10nm™ …  Ever before, these were all 'rumors' Intel either vehemently disputed publicly (despite doing *the exact contrary*), or just let pass without comment, despite everyone involved knew from day one, that such rumors were 100% true.",Neutral

AMD,"It's laughable, as em-dashes (or en-dashes for that matter), have been used especially in typography for at least *the whole of the 20th century*. Actually, around 1850–1990 was the height of such usage in anything print.  Look at any newspaper-archive; Virtually every other older printed text (and even handwritten ones) the last hundred years, uses dashes for *separating the principal clause from the subordinate clause* (En-dash; –, HTML:`&ndash;`) like a counter-argument the writer dropped mid-sentence (for not trying to disrupt the readers' current train of thought), while embedded sentences either \*within\* a principal clause or between principal and the subordinate clause, is ought to be signified with a Em-dash before at the beginning and the end afterwards (Em-dash; —, HTML:`&mdash;`).  **Edit:** Specifically full dashes are also used in writing (directly at the point of breakage), to signify to the reader a sentence or written (direct) speech, which ended abruptly mid-sentence. The same goes for suspension marks (ellipses; …; `&hellip;`), if the recipient is supposed to fill in the blanks by himself.

They also spent way more on marketing because AMD had to spend huge amounts on CPU.  There you have it, the answer on why people buy Nvidia-cards. Not because those would be (always) necessarily better, but mostly out of the market's *brand-perception* — nVidia spent billions to fabricate their leader-image.

One thing I noticed in the past from my years of PC experience is that your system will generally use less RAM if its going to be approaching the limit. This suggests that theres algorithms that will use disk space instead and/or do memory reallocations. There is a performance cost to this.

AMD,"Platform longevity has to have some kind of financial value placed on it.   The maximum value of long platform longevity is the price of a motherboard. And you maximize this value if you buy into the very first generation on that platform. So every subsequent generation you enter in, the value of platform longevity goes down.   You also have to consider what impact generational improvements have on platform longevity. Zen 1 -> Zen 3 was a huge jump. Assuming Zen 7 on AM5, I don't think we're gonna see that level of improvement with Zen 4 -> Zen 7.  Let's say someone upgrades from AM4 to AM5 with the launch of Zen 6. They receive less value from platform longevity than someone who entered at Zen 4. And someone who bought in at Zen 4 will likely receive less value than someone who bought in at Zen 1.  So yes, platform longevity does have value. It's better to have platform longevity than to not have it.

If you just want to replace the CPU, you unscrew 4 screws to remove your cooler/AIO pump head, pop open the socket, put your new CPU in, repaste and remount the cooler, plug some fans back in if necessary, and you're good. Maybe remove the GPU if you're really pressed for space.  When changing an entire motherboard, you have to unmount the cooler, remove the GPU, unplug every cable plugged into the motherboard, possibly remove some AIO fans/the radiator (or just fans in general) from the case if they're getting in the way of the motherboard screws, remove the motherboard, and remove any SSDs you want to reuse.   Then you have to put everything (CPU, SSDs, RAM) on the new motherboard, put the new motherboard in, repaste and remount the cooler, remount any fans you had to take off and plug them back into the motherboard, plug all your PSU cables again, then put your GPU back into place.  You basically have to redo a big chunk of the entire build process. Not to invalidate what you said, maybe you are proficient enough that all that would only take you 10 additional minutes.

You won't eat up any extra wattage or anything, but it will ensure that you don't run into any issues with stability at low power states. Not that you're guaranteed to have issues, just that it sure makes things easier to diagnose when you KNOW it's not your ""OC."" Adrenaline makes it so easy that you might as well.   Additionally, when starting a new game and facing crashing, the absolute first thing you should do is cut your undervolt in half. It's astounding how much variation in stability you'll face with undervolts and different games.   For example, my 9070 XT is stable at -70mv in any synthetic benchmarks I can throw at it. But it wasn't 100% stable in Horizon Forbidden West until I dropped it down to -65mv. Then in Tiny Tina's Wonderlands I had to drop it down to -45mv to avoid the occasional crash.   But if I load up Horizon again, -65mv for 10 hours straight no problem.   Play around and figure it out. It's fun.",Neutral

AMD,"Dies are not, and have really never been the main cost driver in GPUs.   Dies were absolutely a bit cheaper back in like 2017, but it's not by the huge amount that people believe. These days the die is the most expensive individual piece of a GPU, but not anywhere near the majority of the cost.  The GB203 in a 5070Ti or 5080 costs roughly $100 assuming 95% yields and 18k per wafer (95% viable for 5080 or 5070Ti). A 1080Ti die (GP102) would've cost about $50 adjusted for inflation.   So yes, the dies are more expensive, but they have gone from like 7% of the total price the end user pays for a mid tier to high end GPU, to about 10-13%.   The main cost driver for GPUs is not the dies, but the fact that Nvidia can make so much more money elsewhere, and need to jack up prices in order to justify the continued existence of their consumer GPU business. A wafer used to produce GB203s is a wafer out of Nvidias wafer allocation that can't be used to produce much higher margin GB200s. Every wafer of Nvidia's allocation not used to produce GB200s basically costs Nvidia to lose tens, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars they would have made in additional profits. By raising consumer prices they can somewhat soften that blow, hence why they have continued to go up.  N2 is probably where the wafer costs will actually start being a significant cost driver if Nvidia/AMD want to maintain margins, but we should still only be talking consumer price increases of perhaps 10-15% to maintain those margins. Obviously Nvidia and AMD will shrink the dies and jack up their prices much higher anyway, then shift the blame onto TSMC and their wafer prices. But there is really no reason they need those huge price increases for the move to N2 to make sense financially.  Shrinking the die on lower tier cards may be more justified though, as die costs do actually make up a large component of the manufacturing cost there.",Neutral

Nvidia is doing well in the OEM and laptop markets, but for us DIY'ers and enthusiasts, AMD is offering very competitive products. Still behind Nvidia for sure, but doing better than it used to.  And for people rooting for Intel, I know this is an Intel sub mainly, but if you wish more competition, we shouldn't look at Intel. Intel is only eating at AMD's market share, not Nvidias.

AMD,There are definitely times where that question can be easily and usefully answered,Neutral
AMD,"In general hardware has aged like open yoghurt out of the fridge.  Sometimes anomalies happen, it's not the first time.  I remember major price hikes and poor performance increases after the 9800pro ( x800 and x1800 sucked, hd series was little better until the hd4000) nvidia sucked after geforce 4 until the 8000 series.   People who bought gpus during the crypto boom at insane prices got fleeced. People who bought a 3060 ti or 3080 right before got lucky, people  who waited for a 4070super also got a better deal.  By the time the prices have started rising its too late.  If a gpu is available at msrp at launch you can rarely find better value later in the gen as prices dont drop anymore until the next gen. So yeah either buy at launch and msrp or wait for the next cycle   Imo if you are on a complete potato gpu now and need a cheap upgrade then second hand 3060ti are very cheap (190 euros) , else a 5070ti is the only thing id consider to have any performance/price right now. Everything else is either way more expensive for little gain, or has too little vram for the price. Or is too small an upgrade for the money over a cheap second hand 3060ti, or has poor second hand pricing.   5060 would be more interesting if the base model came with 12 GB and was priced at 250",Negative
AMD,"I remember 2 to 4 weeks before the 9070xt launch people were telling others to ""just buy a 7900xt"" for $700. I guess they got 4gb of extra VRAM out of it, but 95% will never use it. But I think there is a time to actually just wait, instead of buying $700 product that will be worth $500 in less than a month.",Negative
AMD,"500€? New? God damn thats a steal.  There used to be a general idea for buying hardware, *Just buy it when you need it, there is always the next big thing coming*, which still is in part true, but man with the volatility of the market since Corona Im 100% certain you can time your buys.",Negative

AMD,"Could be a pretty massive difference. Each AIB fighting to source memory on individual smaller contracts instead of NVIDIA just making one big deal for the entire production run, taking advantage of the scale to get it cheaper.",Neutral
AMD,Sure they are expanding GDDR7.  But for servers mostly.  RTX 6000 Pro Blackwell (96GB GDDR7) is a hot server GPU for inference use cases that aren't just the giant LLMs.  It is much more cost efficient than the B200 HBM offerings for all sorts of use cases that don't need to access too much RAM concurrently.  Several NVidia competitor hopefuls have also gone the GDDR route for inference focused AI accelerators.,Positive
AMD,They're already sacrificing margins on making consumer GPUs instead of AI GPUs,Neutral
AMD,"There are rumors that Nvidia will no longer be bundling VRAM with their GPUs in the face of rising memory prices, and AIBs will have to source it on their own.  While Nvidia may be ""absorbing costs"" on their FE models which have very limited production, for the vast majority of consumer graphics cards they're going to be passing on costs to the AIBs and thus consumers.   They have absolutely no incentive to absorb costs, anyway. Their entire consumer gaming graphics division is already being run at a massive opportunity cost to their real money maker, datacenter GPUs. It's frankly a miracle that they haven't decided to entirely scrap it yet when the same dies they're selling to consumers for a few grand at most can be sold to AI datacenters for tens of thousands.",Neutral

AMD,That's only a rumor and has not been confirmed.,Neutral
AMD,"Why are AMD's margins slimmer?  They're manufacturing at the same place using very similar technology. Their equivalent product is actually a little smaller than Nvidia's in terms of die size... they're a big TSMC customer, while obviously not as big as Nvidia they're not some small timer who can't negotiate a favourable deal either.  On this basis I would assume AMD and Nvidia have very similar margins on GPU sales to board partners.",Neutral

AMD,"When you've been there for 20 years and kept losing market share in the last decade continuously, you are in deep problem. But for AMD, right now they prefer being the SOC for gaming and have little interest in putting effort in dGPUs.",Negative
AMD,"I doubt Nvidia will raise prices they will most likely just stop producing FE""s. Which isn't the same as eating the cost or raising it.   Then AIB's will most likely raise pricing. That isn't due to Nvidia thats AIB's doing what they gotta do.   As far as priority gaming has never been the priority for Nvidia this generation. There priority is AI chips. Everything else is secondary to that.   AMD CPU division is basically printing money now. They want there GPU division to go anywhere. There going to need to be more competitive, right now there not.   They don't offer a better software stack, Ray tracing or anything to match the 5080 in performance. They also have a reputation of dropping support a LOT sooner then Nvidia  That means they need to become a value leader and why in the world would you pay the same or more for a 9700xt over a 5070 Ti?   Specially if the two are with in 50 dollars of each other or even 100 dollars of each other.",Negative
AMD,"Whelp if that rumors become the truth, then it is definitely right to expect the Nvidia GPUs will also get a price increase, i just wonder when it will happen and why AMD did it first with their RDNA 4...",Neutral
AMD,"Usually it's best not to buy during the post-launch rush when prices are way inflated, unless one can get one of the few actual MSRP offers.  Other than that, I totally agree that trying to predict the future is largely futile. Especially now that generational improvements have become so slow and low. Hardware holds its value for longer than ever before and the risk of buying a product only to see it depreciate it soon after is therefore also low.  People who bought any decently reviewed GPU at MSRP since the RTX 20-series have gotten pretty good value by now.",Negative

AMD,and proper setups cost quite a bit too.,Neutral
AMD,"Books are cheaper? as an avid reader i would say that in terms of enjoyment hours/dollar books are more expensive unless you stick to library and flea sales. Movies are terrible value. 2 hours per movie ticket price is nowhere even close to gaming value proposition. TV shows, i suppose if you got netflix subscirption and watch it a lot its competetive.  As for more expensive, look up how much good fishing gear costs, let alone if you want a fishing boat. Treking gear also costs quite a lot if you want to keep doing it and it not to fall apart after first use or be so uncomfortable you wont be doing that as a hobby anymore. Plenty of expensive hobbies around.",Negative

A little research showed that there's just a difference of $2-3 per GB, which comes around **$30-50 for 16GB**. Please don't try to say the PCB circuitry is $300 because PCB's is one of the cheapest components of a GPU.  LE: You say the costs are influenced by cooling.

AMD,Part of that markup is from the die area getting more expensive. The other part is Nvidia further increasing margins and implementing more expensive memory for what is arguably a net negative.

AMD,"I don't quite agree with that - unless the 9800X3D has much better heat dissipation than the 7800X3D which I currently have with a Noctura NH-D15 - and even that idles at 58-50C. Plus under load, you can definitely hear the fans spinning up and down. That's why I was thinking AIO. I could get another Noctura, but wanted to try something different and potentially more efficient (and quiet).",Negative
AMD,Switching to 9800X3D.,Neutral
AMD,"Gotcha; I'll switch to the 9800X3D. You recommend a Noctura NH-D15 then? That's $140. Question is does the AIO cool better overall? I don't mind spending if it does.

AMD,"The 9800X3D moved the 3D v-cache to under the compute cores. This puts the compute cores directly on top of the stack, in direct contact with the heat spreader. This makes it easier to keep cool.",Neutral
AMD,"You have a 7800X3D and you want to upgrade already? But why? Upgrading every gen is a waste of time and money.  There's nothing to disagree with. 9800X3D runs under 100W for most gaming workloads, same as 7800X3D. You could run this with a stock cooler if you wanted to.   Idle temps mean absolutely nothing. Your CPU could run at those temps indefinitely, and idle isn't even an established state. Just because you aren't doing anything doesn't mean your PC isnt' doing anything. Max temps under load is what actually matters. Your idle temps also seem just fine.  The fans will spin up and down regardless. AIOs use the same fans, and run according to the same fan curves.

AMD,"First, thank you for this and the time you took to put it together. A few things; I want a v5 SSD that can do 14,7 on the transfer - that's a 9100 Pro. The case would require at least one additional fan - but do we really need fans up top?: I think 3 in front and 1 in back with the Phantom Spirit is fine. I do agree after really thinking about this - AIO pumps always go bad after 5+ years. Air fans; just replace them as they start to make noise. Air really is the best choice, so that saves a ton of money.  I don't need 64GB. 32GB is fine.  As for the 5080, that would require a 1000w PSU. There's no question the 5080 is faster and DLSS is better than FSR. But is the 15% difference worth $400? Not quite sure TBH. Plus the 5080 you linked has pretty bad reviews. I'd want to pay a bit more for a better reviewed card.  Here's what I put together: [https://pcpartpicker.com/user/SkrunchyCakes/saved/#view=D2FCFT](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/SkrunchyCakes/saved/#view=D2FCFT)  Not sure how to share the list as you did.",Positive
AMD,BTW I meant to ask - why are you recommending 64GB vs. 32GB?,Neutral
AMD,"> I want a v5 SSD that can do 14,7 on the transfer - that's a 9100 Pro.  Why? A gaming system will never make use of those speeds. There's essentially no real world difference between PCIe 3.0 and 4.0. 5.0 is just overkill.  I included a 1050W PSU in my build. You picked an SFX unit designed for small form factor cases that is needlessly expensive.  > But is the 15% difference worth $400? Not quite sure TBH.  You said you were willing to pay $150 extra for faster RAM that improves your performance by 5%. I'm a litttle confused by your priorities.",Negative
AMD,Because a few applications can make use of it and you seemed not to care about costs.,Neutral
AMD,Ahh you're correct on the SFX. The difference is RAM speed impacts everything the computer does all the time. The video card only impacts performance FPS above a certain threshold tied to the refresh rate of the monitor (I'm currently 144Hz). You are correct on the SSD; PCIe 4.0 will work fine.  I'm also hesitant to use a brand (Monarch) I've never heard of and AFAIK hasn't been well established.,Neutral
AMD,Your choice. The Montech Century II is highly rated by professional reviewers.,Neutral
AMD,I assume I'd only need one additional fan to blow out of the back of that case? BTW curious - do you have any of these exact components you recommended?,Neutral
AMD,Why not RX 9060 XT?,Neutral
AMD,5060 due to wattage and features.,Neutral
AMD,Why the fuck is it between the 5060 and 6800?,Negative
AMD,"If he's 1080p, you can still get away with 8GB well on 99.9% of games. Even at 1440p with upscaling only a few you might have to drop a couple settings i.e. ultra -> very high (mainly textures). I personally had a ton of driver related problems on my RX 6000 series AMD card over time, so I'd sooner go for Nvidia or possibly a newer AMD card instead.",Neutral
AMD,"that build no matter a new gpu is quite ""old"" granted probably will still hold up. best to switch if possible to a Am5 socket ryzen at least 7 series cpu. ddr5 recommend 32 gb fuckign windows 11 is chunking my 32gb ddr5 ram under minimal load as is. and i've ran debloat scripts turned off all auto start disabled fast boot i got xmp enabled a slight GPU OC like i got 7 tabs open in browser and discord on the side monitor damn near 35 percent my memory utilized at the moment. although the b650 platform was announced discontinued. well they brought it back. and now it would be a super viable option for your buddy if you have microcenter in your area i highly recommend seeing whats in the holiday bundles atm",Neutral
AMD,what about a 9060xt?,Neutral
AMD,"The 6800 isn't a great choice, since it's 2 generation old and needs at least a 600w psu.  I also wouldn't get a gpu with less than 12gb of ram, even if he only plays in 1080p.  If he's willing to search for it and spend a bit more he could look for a 9060 xt 16gb, it would work with his psu as it only has a tdp of 160w and it's also pretty good in 1440p.  He could look for a used 4070/4070 super, it would work pretty well.",Negative
AMD,I'd guess price,Neutral
AMD,"He suggested the 5060, and I suggested the 6800. It's not between the two, I'm asking if my recommendation is correct and if there's a better fit.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, he's running games at 1080p currently. I've heard about the RDNA2 driver issues, I was mainly suggesting the 16GB card because he'll need a CPU and RAM upgrade in a couple of years, and I wasn't sure 8GB would be a good recommendation for a 3+ year card.",Neutral
AMD,Shouldn't it be same or cheaper than a 5060? XD,Neutral
AMD,it should be between  1. 3070 Ti   2. 9060 XT   3. B580   4. 5060   5. 6750 XT,Neutral
AMD,"8gb version is, fair enough. And it does get at least the x16 pcie connector so less of an impact from going over vram. Might be one of the rare cases where the 8gb version makes sense",Neutral
AMD,"These are def more balanced options but the things that sucks is that this is strictly from a gpu standpoint, and having had my own issues with the 9060xt while using a 3700x, id say this removes at least the b580 and 9060xt. It might remove the 5060 too but i dunno how it handles with older amd hardware. I myself ended up upgrading to a 5800XT cause the 3700X couldnt quite keep up.

AMD,"I don’t even really see 3070ti for reasonable prices, they are mostly going for like $600+ due to being discontinued based on what I’m seeing, you may want to update your list.

For gaming, i'd get screen tears, the occasional stuck frame in games with a lot of objects (survivor games or really heavy areas in elden ring) and I'm fos games like fortnite and marvel rivals, i'd get occasional latency issues.  Tbf, these went to the point where these games were unplayable. This wasn't like trying to run a 4090 with my 3700X. It wasn't a horrific imbalance, but it was enough that i noticed it and didn't like it.  Realistically if you want to future proof your friend pic, maybe do get a 9060xt first and explain to em down the line they may wanna get a 5600XT for like $150.  One more thing of note: i will say now that i game in 1080p. Gaming in 1080 puts more pressure on the cpu than the gpu. If your friend games in 1440p, the balance shifts more to the gpu, so in that scenario, their 3600X may be ok.",Negative
AMD,"New, yeah. But ive started to see em on the used market for less than $300.",Neutral
AMD,"Now I’m seeing used ones for those prices, not sure why it didn’t show up a minute ago, but new ones I’m finding prices are cranked I guess due to being discontinued for so long. Bit of a compromise buying used with no warranty though. Whatever the case though I don’t think a 2 gen card is a good recommendation.

AMD,"Ryzen 7500f could cut some costs if available for a good price in your region.  Make sure to get the 16gb model of the GPU, especially if you game at more then 1080P resolution.",Positive
AMD,"Good, this is really similar to my current pc and it runs smooth af.  Only thing is that psu is grey and it might stick out a bit but that’s just aesthetics.",Positive
AMD,"So SAMSUNG 990 PRO Festplatte, 1 TB SSD M.2 via NVMe, intern would be a better investment? And I could use the money that I safe on the cheapest 9060 xt model?",Neutral
AMD,Lots of people advise me to take the 5060 ti because of the problems that amd has. What is your experience? Quite unsure now. Also because the GeForce one is more expensive but suppose to last longer?,Neutral
AMD,Which PSU do you recommend?,Neutral
AMD,"That's spending too much, look for a tlc drive with no dram, for your use case that's the best. Personally, from my experience for just gaming, AMD will serve you well, there are a small number of documented bugs such as crashing when loading cyberpunk 2077 with pathtracing enabled but it's quite minor generally. If you care about raytracing, frame generation and some nvidia exclusive features, the 5060ti is better. Although, at this performance tier, either feature's usefulness is diminished.",Positive
AMD,Gx-850w,Neutral
AMD,Do you have a gpu from amd? If so did you ever come across the problems that everybody is talking about?,Neutral
AMD,Should be night and day compared to your laptop. Great budget build,Positive
AMD,My only suggestion is swapping for 32GB of DDR4 if you intend to stay with AM4. You may be bottlenecked between having multiple browser tabs open of documentation and your toolset of programs open with only 16GB.   The 5700X is a nice balance between single-thread and multi-thread performance though.,Neutral
AMD,Thank you!,Positive
AMD,"I was going to wait for prices to get lower for RAM, thanks!",Positive
AMD,They probably don't want to spend $500+ on RAM right now,Negative
AMD,I just found a Dual Channel RAM for just  \~$200! It has 3600MT/s and CL16! I didn't expect such a low price compared to the 16GB😅,Neutral
AMD,Yea.. the prices are too big😅,Negative
AMD,"I mean, for reference that's more than I paid for 32GB 3000MT/s in 2018. And just 3 months ago I had a 64GB 6000MT/s DDR5 kit in my cart for $159 and thought I'd wait for a better deal on black friday which obviously didn't turn out well",Negative
AMD,$159 for 64GB?! How can it be so cheap??,Neutral
AMD,That's what prices were like until a few months ago,Neutral
AMD,I wish I searched for components earlier🥲,Neutral
AMD,"5060 Ti 16GB is actually a decent card. You may have to upscale for decent frames for 1440p, but it is by no means a slowpoke. For comparison, I have a 9060 XT, it's AMD match, and a 1440p monitor. I get 50fps with raytracing on Cyberpunk, meanwhile I get 120fps on Fortnite on High settings.",Positive
AMD,"The RTX 5060 Ti isn't a terrible card, it's just not an enthusiast card. There's a huge difference between ""not being top-of-the-line"" and ""being bad,"" and many people confuse that.  If it's 16GB, that's great, my friend.",Negative
AMD,it is fine however value wise it isn't that great compared to the 9070 or 5070 which in many cases are better in terms of price to perf like the 5070 for example costs about 20 percent more money for 30 percent more performance.  Looking at it in a vacuum it is pretty great in terms of 1440p performance,Positive
AMD,"Youll be fine, use DLSS quality and 2x Frame gen youll be chillin",Positive
AMD,I was looking at a 5060ti but then saw a 5070 on sale for $50 more and got that instead. People will say they’re bad because for them it’s high end or nothing. Not everyone has $1k-$2k to spend and if you’re happy with the performance that’s what matters. You’ll be fine,Negative
AMD,"It's got the vram, so it'll take 1440p for a while easily.",Neutral
AMD,"5060 Ti 8GB or 16GB?  If 16GB, it's fine, but a 5070 is close enough in price that it's usually worth the jump.  If 8GB, return it.",Neutral
AMD,I could probably get a 5070 but I would have to trade in my 1440 oled monitor for a cheaper one,Neutral
AMD,16GB I could probably afford a 5070 if I return my 1440p oled monitor. But idk if I want to do that bc it’s so nice. It was open box so it was at a discount,Positive
AMD,yeah just keep the oled monitor and 5060 ti  in that case,Neutral
AMD,Then keep the monitor and the 5060 Ti. Your friends are talking out of their asses.,Negative
AMD,They all have a 5080 or 5090 and play at 4K lol. They say my build is weak asf.,Negative
AMD,They sound like they are shitting gold lol  Shall they gift you the money for the upgrade then if they think it’s so bad? A 5090 is like 4 months of my rent here.,Negative
AMD,They are lol. They upgrade every generation. They had a 4080 super or 4090 before the 50 series came out. They just threw away their whole pc instead of giving it to me lol. Bc “I didn’t ask”.,Negative
AMD,"Wow they sound like a bunch of wasteful entitled trust fund babies lol Insane to me. If I had that amount of money all my friends would get the hand me downs but they’d have to idk, help me deep clean my apartment or something.",Negative
AMD,You’re not far off lol. When it comes to something money related they’re kinda out of touch. They’re good ppl at heart tho.,Neutral

AMD,5500x3d,Neutral
AMD,"R5 5500X3D  It even competes with the R5 7600 in many games, overall it'll be a tad faster than the R7 5700X in games unless said game can't benefit from the massive L3 Cache, but even then it'll just be slightly slower than the R7 5700X.  And both will be a great upgrade over your R5 3600.",Positive
AMD,both are fine.   5500x3d slightly faster in games. But negligible.   And both are big upgrade from 3600,Positive
AMD,I just got the 5700x from the 3600. Got it pretty cheap at microcenter.,Neutral
AMD,5500x3d. Very similar to 5600x3d which performs very similar (generally) to the 5700x3d. Lucky to be in a region that has that chip available!,Positive
AMD,I’ve had my 7 5700x since I built my PC in 2022. It has been strong and has far outlived my 3060. I’m keeping it and getting a 5070 and pushing it to 4K !,Positive
AMD,"your not bottlenecking a 9070xt in any way that matters as long as theres enough ram and the os is in good shape .. i run mine on a straight 5600 and i think actual speed of the processor is as important as anything else for general gaming, and that said id rather have the 5700x than a 5500, doubt that is fully supporting pcie4 .. so yeah, unless your trying to get ultra high 4k performance with a high end monitor i wouldnt worry at all about bottlenecking a 70xt, the whole argument there is pretty lame imo ..",Neutral
AMD,"If prices equal: Ryzen 7 5700X  If you only care about gaming at the lowest cost: Ryzen 5 5500X3D  If you can afford to wait, saving up for a real 5800X3D",Neutral
AMD,What’s the price delta between the 5500x3D and the  5700X?,Neutral
AMD,"Either will do fine, 5700x has more cores and it’s about 20-30% faster in tasks that utilize those cores. If you play some fast paced multiplayer games 5500X3D is the way to go, it will provide way better 1% lows due to increased cache. Also the higher your resolution goes, the less cpu performance matters (as long as you don’t get bottlenecked).",Positive
AMD,Can you stretch to get a 5700x3d? You've spent a lot on a graphics card. Might be worth pursuing a little more.,Neutral
AMD,"Oh wait, for real? Is it doing well on the 5600? Can you tell me how you're running your games? CPU usage?",Neutral
AMD,"oh, it's actually the same price lol",Positive
AMD,"At current super-inflated prices on the used market, the 5700x3d  ain't worth it. Hell, you can get a 7800x3D for cheaper most places.",Negative
AMD,"Oh, I could definitely stretch if it was available. But it's literally not in stock anywhere :c     I've scoured every retail store in my country. No one is selling it. I bet that when there's one in stock, it will be worth actual gold.      The only X3D option truly available is the 5500X3d, unfortunately.      Maybe I shouldn't buy a CPU at all and just deal with the bottleneck until prices go down again? If they ever do that is.",Negative
AMD,Ooft,Neutral
AMD,"If 5500x3d is all that's available that's probably the way to go. I bought my 5700x3d through AliExpress and it's been great. But if you can't get it, you're probably better getting the upgrade that you can rn.",Positive
AMD,just go with 9800x3d and air cooler ezpz,Neutral
AMD,"Don't buy 14th Gen Intel. The platform is a dead end, with no upgrades in future. The processors are power hungry, run hot, and have a degradation/instability issue that, even after years of patching, Intel still has not fully 100% clamped down on.  Buy AM5, the current gen AMD stuff. A Ryzen 7 9800X3D will be faster than a 14700K, won't try to kill itself given the chance, and will definitely be supporting at least 1 more generation of new chips to upgrade to, possibly 2 generations more.",Negative
AMD,I have an i7 1400k and wish I would have went AMD. Temps can get crazy and there are known issues with them. I didn’t know that when I bought last year.,Negative
AMD,"Since the Ryzen series dropped intels market share in gaming has steadily decreased and plummeted when 13th and 14th gen performance CPUs oxidised, leading to catastrophic failure or applying a BIOS patch that massively throttles your CPU. Meanwhile AMD CPUs, especially the X3Ds, have shown outstanding performance in gaming.   Intels response to the oxidation incident has lead to massive trust issues and they do not seem to bother, they just focus on the business side with their Xeon and vPro CPUs.  For your concerns about multitasking with chatting and watching videos, any Ryzen 7 from the past 5 years won’t even show a mentionable load for those applications, lol.  Steam Hardware Survey shows a decrease from ~80% in 2020 to ~55% today, choosing an intel CPU for gaming is a no brainer these days, unless you are on a budget and get a very good deal on an i7 from the 15th gen upwards",Negative
AMD,"so literally the only reason you found for not going AMD is ""I've always used intel before""... that doesn't seem like a convincing argument. you already know what to do. ryzen is simply superior at the moment.",Negative
AMD,"The 5080 is a great card, very powerful!  You can almost pair any cpu with it and it will do a wonderful job.  Having said this, it would be a shame to pair the 5080 with a weak cpu.  Get a cpu worthy of the 5080.  At this time, and for the foreseeable future, AMD makes the best cpu's.  The x3d chips are unequaled in their gaming prowess.  AMD also has chips that rival Intel for productivity apps (e.g  the 9950x3d).   Further, the socket that houses the current generation of AMD cpu's,  Zen5, will also be used on the next generation of AMD cpu's,  Zen6, and likely the following gen, Zen7.  Building on AM5 provides not only the best cpu's today, but also for another 3 to 5 years!  Go AMD and never look back!  Key to your decision will be the resolution you game at.  The 5080 is great at 4k, and easily handles 1440p and 1080p as well.  At 1080p you want a powerful cpu to keep the gpu properly fed.  At 4k, and generally at 1440p as well, the cpu is less important as the gpu does most of the work.  These recommend the best cpu/gpu combos (spoiler with the 5080 you will be steered to an x3d cpu): https://youtu.be/sYaIsklaKTE?si=0uKkwQLZ93e825PR https://youtu.be/UHm5wTQBFlI?si=-vaqR79_8EpWXEVf https://youtu.be/EhcNjFlc8ok?si=JT57te-4lWwOPZUY  These are examples of 5080 builds: https://youtu.be/U652ZqZPGBw?si=o6cmEs2Rf2st-AnE https://youtu.be/6tuHW4zD3L4?si=P2U-SDzkv8PxFm_f https://youtu.be/UD_wte591g4?si=Tia9UE966tLkrieN https://youtu.be/yARQUTeE2qY?si=He_4JNbf2CrbeimI  Get a good mobo with pcie5 and usb4 and you'll be able to easily upgrade to Zen6 and Zen7 by simply swapping in a new cpu.  A good mobo will provide a solid foundation for many years.  This assumes you build on AM5.  This should give you some food for thought.  I wish you success selecting great parts and building an awesome machine!  Enjoy your new rig.  Merry Christmas!",Positive
AMD,Good gpu choice. Maybe check some comparisons between price on the 9800x3d with your 14700k. Any twin tower air cooler can handle the 9800 im less familiar with the intel requirements. I expect it likes to have a good size aio to be comfy.,Positive
AMD,"Arrowlake is very efficient and cool, plus it does very well multitasking and gaming. The 14700k can use ddr4, which could save you hundreds. The truth is the 14700k and AMD x3d run hot, most coolers will be fine.   CPU Motherboard Memory Combo - Intel Core Ultra 7 265KF Bundle with ASRock Z890 Pro RS and Corsair CMH32GX5M2E6000C36 https://share.google/9LtffdVXfolq6thOl",Positive
AMD,This. But if you really want an aio or the screen any 240 or larger aio will do just fine on the 9800x3d it's super easy to cool compared to i7/i9s from the 12-14th gen Intel CPUs.,Positive
AMD,I like my liquid cooler,Neutral
AMD,"I upgraded from a 14700k to a 9950x3d for the hell of it, and didn't see any major difference when gaming. Although I don't play shooters at 1080p, lol. Used a 5090 at 4k with both.  14700k was usually in the 60's gaming with a 360aio, and low for idle. Spikes to 80's for things like shader compilations. Cinebench ran hot of course.  Unless you're having issues with it, which most don't, you're perfectly fine.",Neutral
AMD,"Last sentence, I think you mean, choosing an AMD CPU is a no brainer (the easy choice)",Neutral
AMD,"It was just something I did out of familarity and comfort. I knew Intel and their processors never let me down, so it was just easier to default to them, which helped picking out mobos and the rest of the build easier for my insanely indesisive brain. I realize now I really should've been keeping an eye on AMD. I do know what I need to do now. :]",Positive
AMD,"9800x3d is incredibly efficient and easy to cool, and unlike anything Intel, isn't a dead socket.",Positive
AMD,"The 14700k can use DDR4 at a roughly 20% performance penalty, yeah. Arrow Lake isn’t bad in isolation, and it does have a few use cases, but the OP’s isn’t one of them, and it’s a dead-end platform, unlike what AMD offers with Zen 5.",Neutral
AMD,it is swaggy,Neutral
AMD,Great to hear. Thanks!,Positive
AMD,"AM5 is dead after this refresh, AM6 at 2nm will be a new socket. Who really upgrades within a generation?",Negative
AMD,Yeah also I feel like it's okay to go hard on the cooling for a CPU but maybe that's because I like to overwork my CPU,Neutral
AMD,"People over exaggerate the issues. Not to downplay them, but its MOSTLY stopped popping up since the bios updates matured.  Most issues were with i9's as well, with a significant smaller percentage of i7's.  And performance wasn't reduced as much as some people love to scream about.  They're still top tier processors that will handle anything you're likely to throw at them, and then some.  Hope you feel better about what you have 😀 And Intel increased the warranty length for them.",Neutral
AMD,"What? No it’s not. Zen 6 (in Early 2027) which is rumored to be on the N2X node and be a big jump in performance, will be on AM5, and Zen 7 (another jump but smaller) is also rumored to be on AM5 as well, in part to compete with Intel and not have an end-of-life socket when Intel won’t. That puts AM6 around 2030/2031 with Zen 8. That’s pretty good longevity as I see it.",Neutral
AMD,"You might be confusing Intel and AMD here. Arrow Lake (LGA1851) is  getting a (slight) refresh next month, and the gen after that (Nova Lake), is rumored to be on TSMC 2nm and will have a new socket: LGA1954. That may get several generations of support (as the rumor also goes), we’ll have to wait and see if Intel breaks their historical pattern and actually does that.",Neutral
AMD,for the 14700k it draws 253w so its advisable to use a 360 even 420 aio  for 9800x3d which has 120w its super overkill but it will have high temps cuz its just due to design  the 9800x3d is just da best gaeming cpu atm its no breiner,Neutral
AMD,"Ah, okay thank you, this helps a lot. I do still want to go with the AIO because I really do love how it looks, and hearing that it would be overkill for cooling just makes me feel a lot less worried.  Also, I heard some people struggled to get their air coolers to fit with the GPU's in this case, because GPUs have to stand upright inside it by design. lol.",Positive
AMD,"To add to it: Intel offers no upgrade path. If you go AMD, you will have 1 to 2 generations of future CPUs on your motherboard, if you decide you want more performance later. Intel will have something good to compete with AMD in a year or so (Intel Nova Lake), but that’s then and this is now.",Neutral
AMD,You can get a good cheap AIO like the Thermalright Aqua Elite 3 it's like stupid cheap. I got an MSI i360 for $125 CAD with around $55 CAD in Steam rebates and also some cashback so that was a good price for me but yeah pretty much any decently made AIO will work I think,Positive
AMD,"Are you taking into consideration the price for DDR5 RAM? I would stay on the 5600X for now. Performance wise there is not much between the 7800 and 9800 in gaming, little bit, but they will both do well.",Neutral
AMD,"Your combo of 5600x and 3070 is a very balanced one, so I do not see significant benefit of going AM5 without upgrading the GPU. Most games will be limited by 3070, so any benefit from AM5 will be marginal.   If you really want AM5, the most cost-effective CPU right now is probably 9600x, with plenty of power for any modern game, and you can save for the future GPU upgrade, for example 5070 or better.   7800X3D and 9800X3D are obviously more powerful CPUs, but they make sense only in combination with similarly high-end GPU, starting from 5070 ti or 9070xt.",Neutral
AMD,"The 9700x isn't as favored due to having very similar performance to the much cheaper 9600x in most games, so unless you need 2 extra cores the 9600x is the better choice.  The 7800x3d and 9800x3d are both the best gaming gpu and have overall great performance and the 7800x3d sometimes can be found for as low as 300$.",Positive
AMD,"With the cost of ram prices right now,   If I need more performance I'd probably buy rzyen 7 5700/5800 or buy a new GPU depending on your budget",Neutral
AMD,A 7800x3d performs better than a 9700x.  Plus you also don't need to buy ddr5 RAM which is too expensive right now.,Positive
AMD,"Don't trust initial reviews. They just it plug in and run at default, at 65W. Sure, it performs as previous gen at 105W.  [This dude](https://youtu.be/vkoiCfDK1SU?si=FkagKVx97PcSXIKV) took it personally and proved that it's a great chip. But, some conditions need to be applied. Zen 5 excels at IF 1:1 with DDR5 6400. You have to say PBO and curve optimizer. Then you'll have great performing 115W 9700X.",Positive
AMD,"Upgrading to am5 now without upgrading your gpu wont give you much real world improvements.  Buy the cheap ddr5 ram now & save towards new cpu/mobo/gpu later.   If you do buy a cpu now, id go for the 7800x3d & save the difference towards a gpu.",Negative
AMD,I got a 7600. It seems adequate. I think I’ve also got a 5060ti 16gb for perspective.,Positive
AMD,I would upgrade your GPU before your 5600x tbh if your budget would allow for at least a 5070 or 9070,Neutral
AMD,"you would have to build a new pc and ram prices are insane right now  You keep saying CPU, but you can't just swap them.  You would need  CPU, motherboard, and ram at the least.",Negative

AMD,Any thoughts about upping the cpu and gpu on curent system instead and wait for am6? 5700/5800(3d) and 9070xt or nvidia eq.,Neutral
AMD,Wait for AM6.,Neutral
AMD,"Yes I am, the price has not spiked as much in my area yet, its half the reason I want to do the upgrade now before it gets worse haha.  And theres no downside to the age of the 7800?",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah I plan to upgrade the GPU some time later in the year, I just don't want to blow that much money at once. A GPU(5070) costs about the same price as the CPU, motherboard and RAM combined here.",Neutral
AMD,"I am aware, as I stated in my post.  > For context on the rest of my build, seeing as I'm switching from AM4 to AM5, everything else will also be upgrade except my GPU which is a 3070.",Neutral
AMD,"I was looking at upgrading earlier in the year as my system struggles a bit at maintaining 60fps at 1440p in some newer games, but decided against it specifically because I don't think its all that necessary yet.  I decided to do the upgrade now since I'm not seeing the increase in RAM price yet and I don't know how long its going to take to come down once it does go up.  GPU is also planned, but only later in the year.",Neutral
AMD,Isn't AM6 still years away?,Neutral
AMD,"No downsides except for a bit less performance in multitasking. If RAM is normal where you live, act fast!",Neutral
AMD,"As guy said! Fast! Get 7800x3d if u want just gamer, 9800x3d to just not care at all for anything",Neutral
AMD,No from price vs performance increase standpoint.   7800x3d is cheaper and only loses couple of frames.,Neutral
AMD,A 7800X3D is enough if you're looking to save but I got a 9800X3D with my 5070 Ti because I want my rig to last a good 8-10 years without my CPU being the bottleneck.,Positive
AMD,"Do you play CPU intensive games? Do you use a high refresh rate monitor? Do you play competitive games? If you answer any of these questions with yes, then go with the 9800X3D. Otherwise go with the cheaper option.  People only look at average FPS, which is not a good metric, when comparing these two cpus.   Also the 9800X3D runs cooler and can be overclocked.",Neutral
AMD,"I've seen this asked a few times today, the consensus seems to be no",Neutral
AMD,"Of course it isn’t, but you also can’t look at the math that way. The 9800X3D is 30% more expensive for a 10%(obviously depends on how you benchmark it but on average 10%) performance increase. There are lots of great historical posts about this topic.",Negative
AMD,"about 3% more performance on average. Is it worth it is subjective to you, but probably not.  https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d/19.html",Neutral

AMD,"I run a 7800X3D for PCVR use and I did my best to understand the impact of the CPU in my use case using tools like fpsVR to look at CPU frametime in gameplay and there was zero gain to be had upgrading my CPU to a 9800X3D.   The 7800X3D is more than capable for the framerates you can expect from your GPU in VR. And with regards to 1% lows and smoothness. i did experience microstutters but that was nothing to do with CPU, ie switching to USBC-ethernet on the Quest3 completely eliminated previous microstutters. So again upgrading to 9800X3D wouldnt have netted me any observable benefit.",Positive
AMD,Nah I have the 9800x3d with 5070Ti and it’s an overkill.,Neutral
AMD,"I'm using a 7800x3d with a 5080 on a 1440p, 240Hz OLED monitor and I'm limited by the GPU. Draw your own conclusions.",Neutral
AMD,How much extra is the 98 vs 78? 100 more or so? No question for me tbh,Neutral
AMD,Unless you want to play CS2 or the difference is less than 50 USD then I'd get the 7800X3D.,Neutral
AMD,"300-400PLN is 100 euro, so it would be worth it IMO. 9800x3d is still better, faster, and runs cooler.    In other EU countries the difference is usually around 200€, so 7800x3d is still most sold AMD CPU, but for your case I would go with 9800x3d.",Positive
AMD,"If the price difference is > $150, then you need to think about it, else I would suggest 9800X3D",Neutral

AMD,"Only if you use the CPU for productivity too because 9800X3D is noticeably better in that than 7800X3D. If not, then go with the 7800X3D...",Positive
AMD,"If you're a temperature gamer, and worry a lot about cpu at 99% load. I suggest going for 9800x3d, due to the design, the 7800x3d itself has an insulator inside the silicone layers, making it runs possibly steamier at 99% load, mine reached 88.5 celcius during tests and very cpu bound games, even AIO can't cool it. on 9800x3d the problem is solved, it runs way cooler on a dual-tower air cooler, because there is no insulator, so it opens to more overclock possibility. For default performance, both are identical, with 3-5 fps difference at max. To me that didnt justify 60% price increase so I went with 7800x3d, more money into rams ( which turned out well because fuck Ai bubble)",Neutral
AMD,"Do you plan to do anything else with the PC? Productivity, work, etc? If so, consider that a 9900X might be a good choice too, and maybe cheaper than either of those.

AMD,7800x3d now or wait for zen 6 to come out next year (it looks like it's going to be a big improvement).,Positive
AMD,I just got a 9800x3d for my 9070 XT if money isn't too much of an issue id just spring for it. You're then getting the best gaming CPU on the market that's future proof meaning it'll handle stuff for a long time without getting outdated. In the end it's worth it,Positive
AMD,Just curious if you bought a CPU ten years ago if this could be true today,Neutral
AMD,"Hardware Unboxed showed around ~10% performance increase over 7800X3D and that is at 1080p. These 10% extra performance won’t last extra few years honestly, but it might give you a headroom to play a game at 60 fps vs 50 if that helps. If it was a real generational uplift, I’d agree. But 9800X3D is bearly any faster than 7800X3D, unless we talk about a very specific games that take advantage of 3D cache. If you take into consideration 1440p, the gap becomes even narrower. By the time 7800X3D is obsolete, 9800X3D will also be.",Positive
AMD,That system is going to be waaay outdated and irrelevant long before 8 to 10 years.  Think 5 years.,Negative
AMD,The 7800X3D is 8% slower on average. They'll both be obsolete at the same time.,Neutral
AMD,"8-10 years might be a bit too ambitious, 3D stacked transistor design is close (2-4 years) along with photonic links also being developed which can expand multi chip design.",Neutral
AMD,Yeah…not gonna happen. In next 10 years it will be what 1800X is now.,Negative

AMD,"Those are graphically demanding games at 1440p. The games OP plays make a huge difference. If they mostly play AAA games at 4K with RT at 60FPS, then it will make no difference at all. If they play fast-paced competitive shooters at minimum graphical settings for 240+Hz monitor, then it can be a pretty solid improvement",Neutral
AMD,25-30% more money for 5-10% more performance.,Neutral
AMD,Zen 6 starting msrp will starting from $700 at very least imo.,Neutral
AMD,All depends on the games you play but no 10 year old CPU holds up for the latest AAA games. Will a 9800X3D hold up in 10 years? Unlikely but it all depends on what games they will be playing in 10 years and what kind of CPU advancements happen in the next 10 years. There was a 6 year period there where no CPU major improvements happened.,Neutral
AMD,"10 years is possible but it depends on when in the refresh cycle you do you build.   Looking back 10 years was the rough period of Intel pushing 4C/8T at the top end for multiple generations and AMD hardly in the CPU competition. The legendary i5-2500K (4C/4T, 2011) was viable for a long time after its introduction. However an i7-7700K (4C/8T, 2017) would be become dated far more quickly as 6 core and 8 core CPUs became prevalent and games started utilizing more cores in the 2020s.   Remains to be seen if a powerful 8C/16T CPU will remain viable for a long time or become obsolete with future CPUs using higher core counts.",Neutral
AMD,"Another important consideration: [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) is starting to decay in practice due to physical constraints, i.e., CPU transistors will soon stop doubling every 2 years, as the law dictates. https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/penn-engineering-moores-law-really-dead  Due of this, the difference in CPUs 10 years ago to today is going to be **much larger** than the difference between CPUs today and in 10 years -- *unless* a significant breakthrough in chip architecture occurs I guess.",Neutral
AMD,I had a 6800K until recently and it was more than fine for 60 fps (AAA; >120 esports). Moreover the advances for CPUs (and software support) have stalled so a 9800X3D will more than be able to last 10 years. Just think about the fact that the console's future cpu will still be nowhere near it and even the PS5 will keep being the primary platform for another 7 years.,Neutral
AMD,"Definitely not, but it definitely feels like we're seeing a stagnation in desktop CPU technology incoming. At this point I wouldn't be surprised if the 9800x3d actually would still be viable in 7, 8, 9 years.",Negative

AMD,My 6700K/1070 still plays WoW and the occasional modern game at low settings.,Neutral
AMD,Betting against the Moore's law,Neutral
AMD,"Nope. But thats because 10 years ago, ryzen did not exist and 4 core 8 thread intel chips were king. In my opinion, innovation isnt a product of time, but rather of competition. New generational leaps require a competitive landscape where companies try to outperform eqch other. When theres no competition, theres no incentive for companies to innovate.  So if you expect there to be low competition for 10 years, then the top chips of today will become obsolete slower. If you expect high competition, then obsolescence happens faster.  I ran an 8700k/1080Ti build from 2017 until Nov 2025 and the jump to 9800k/5070 Ti is staggering.",Neutral
AMD,"I bet it won't. but it will certainly last a good five, like the 5800X3D now, is still very strong and is enough even for the most demanding games.",Positive
AMD,"Fully agree with this statement, if you have money to spend go for 9800x3d but the idea that it’s gonna last a lot longer than 7800x3d so it’s good to future proof is just wrong. They’re both very comparable and by the time 7800x3d starts bottlenecking people’s pcs so will the 9800x3d. They’re both amazing gaming cpus so you can’t go wrong with either one just choose which ever your budget works best with.",Positive
AMD,"Games you play at 300+ FPS with no stutter at all like valorant, cs2. Anything graphically intensive your gpu will matter more. At 1080p and high frame rate or cpu intensive RTS games you want a great cpu.",Positive

AMD,"Speaking for having a 2700X in my second system and knowing a dozen people still with them, they still work fine - not superlative, but they can game without causing problems",Positive
AMD,"Moore’s Law is used a bit misleadingly here. It was about transistor density and cost, not a guaranteed doubling of CPU performance every two years. While transistor scaling has clearly slowed, performance gains haven’t stopped all together, they’ve shifted toward architecture, parallelism, chiplets, and specialization. It’s plausible the last 10 years saw bigger raw gains than the next 10, but that’s not a direct or inevitable consequence of Moore’s Law “decaying”, it depends heavily on workload and design choices, not just physics.  A good parallel is Dennard scaling. When it broke in the mid-2000s, CPU clock speeds largely stopped increasing, but overall CPU performance continued to rise. For example, an AMD FX-4170 (2012) has a ~4.2 GHz base clock, while a Ryzen 7600X is ~4.7 GHz. GHz barely changed, yet real-world performance is vastly higher due to IPC gains, more cores, and better architectures instead of higher clocks.  It's still definitely possible to see CPU real world performance significantly increasing over the next decade. There's a lot of exciting new tech in the world of transitions and semiconductor material science. Not necessarily saying its the future, but synthetic diamond semiconductors vs traditional silicon ones is one example of an improvement that is still possible.",Neutral
AMD,"Brother I hate to tell you this, but even lower end cpus from generations before the 5800x3d are enough for games today. Obviously the performance is better with newer stuff, but plenty of older chips get more than enough performance with recent titles",Neutral

AMD,I was trying out the Space Marine 2 demo on my ancient 2600K and it was still working at 40fps minimum for 3440x1440. I think people overestimate how the curve has flattened over the years. I'm going to upgrade now because Windows updates are now starting to break my motherboard and other old drivers.,Neutral
AMD,I ran with an 8700K until those year and it handled up to 1440p pretty admirably in a lot of games. Obviously varied game by game but it was sufficient.,Positive
AMD,i think 5800x3d has the potential due to the extra cache. Would need to wait,Neutral
AMD,I had an i7 4790k and that came out in 2014 and paired with a 2080s on I think mid/low 1440 on dlss 60ish fps on black myth wukong so it’s not terrible but it definitely struggles. It especially struggles on cs2 kinda Fortnite and definitely rust as that would dip to 40 fps and could stay often at 40 otherwise it was max 60fps in a server.,Negative
AMD,"a lot of those intel chips wont take Win 11, which as far as crappy self-inflicted limitations go...",Neutral
AMD,"Can you explain what you’re attempting to argue here?   Firstly, it seems to me that you’re repeating what I’m saying but specifying that it’s actually the transistors doubling (and the performance grows exponentially, which no longer holds true as it’s now already down to linear growth), which is obvious given that it’s the first sentence in the only wiki article I had linked and I intentionally did not get into this distinction for brevity’s sake.   Secondly, your only argument against my claim is that other factors such as **chip architecture** could make a difference to fill in the gap left by a slowing Moore’s Law. I very clearly already said this.  Finally, yes, Moore’s Law is “decaying”. There is a clear reason for this rooted in physics, despite what you have said. Transistors are now approaching single-atom dimensions (around 0.2-0.34 nm for silicon/carbon), physical limits where quantum effects (electron leakage) and manufacturing challenges (positioning individual atoms) make further shrinking difficult. Please at least bother to do a quick google search before commenting again - there are hundreds of articles and peer-reviewed articles on this very topic.",Neutral
AMD,I think the big difference is whether that “8-10 year” span includes a GPU upgrade. That time period is roughly what it takes it to go from top-spec to minimum spec in AAAs.   What some people are really asking about is whether buying the higher end CPU means they can drop in a new GPU of a similar tier in 6-7 years down the line and keep using it for 3-4 more years as-is. At that point though even the entry level chips from newer contemporary platforms will likely be substantially more powerful and better matched for the new hardware.,Neutral
AMD,"my spouse's rig is still rocking my old 6700k/1080 Ti. They also basically just play their Steam Deck now which is roughly what the rig is capable of on the occasional impulse to play something like HOMM3 or Rise of Nations.

AMD,same here. My old rig (i5 6600k/1070) was running like a champ until the forced Win 11 upgrade. that's an almost 10yr old CPU. the only thing I did was upgrading the RAM to 32Gb.  I built my new rig (9800X3D/5080) a few weeks back and the plan is to keep it for several years. might upgrade the RAM at some point if needed -at the current rate of price increases it might cost like my whole PC in just a couple of years LOL,Neutral

AMD,People with 9800x3D and 50 series GPUs can't afford 32GB of RAM.  Welcome to 2026.,Neutral
AMD,32GB of system RAM is probably optimal. But 16GB is probably sufficient.,Neutral
AMD,"Can you get single 16GB, and in few months get another 16GB? That way, you will have dual channel 32GB which should be enough.",Neutral
AMD,"That's not bad; 16 GB is still the current standard for games, and practically all titles will run without crashing due to lack of memory, even on high/ultra settings.",Negative
AMD,"I think you might be ok with 4 sticks of DDR5 at 8GB each.  Because each stick only has 8GB it's considered single rank, so you can run 4 sticks of single rank RAM.  Just remember to keep your current kit in the slots where your motherboard manual recommends them to be at for a two stick configuration (usually slots 2 and 4) and then add the future 2 stick kit in the other slots.  People have instability issues when they try to run 4 sticks of dual rank RAM (I think this would be 32GB sticks and larger).  So you should be fine.",Positive

AMD,16x2gb DDR 5 cl30 (best) or cl36 at min and with expo if possible,Neutral
AMD,"It’s better to at least have 32gb ram for gaming, for the fact that most games are needing more RAM to run the games now a days. You can always over clock your ram in your bios if you buy a decent ram to do so.",Neutral
AMD,"16GB will do okay if you turn off all other softwares when playing game.   For my case, I often run 2 games at once, with many background services, I ended up getting 96GB.",Neutral
AMD,"I personally wouldn't do 16GB RAM. I have the same GPU and the 7800, and there's plenty of games that has me going over 16GB on high and ultra settings  You'll end up lowering graphical settings that your GPU is more than good enough to play on to accommodate the RAM",Negative
AMD,"I think 16gb is fine, my dell optiplex uses 512mb and runs gta just fine.",Positive
AMD,"16GB will work, but I'd upgrade when prices come down. an 8GB DIMM doesn't operate at full DDR5 bandwidth so you are leaving some performance on the table. Also stuff is so unoptimized these days, you'll run up against 16GB pretty quickly. I'm not really doing anything demanding, just have a couple streams open and am browsing reddit, a couple programs running in the background, and I have 19.0GB being used right now.",Neutral
AMD,"Make sure you do MSI afterburner.  I did an initial test and was bottom 39 percent, tweaked 2 simple settings and bam top 8 percent.  Enjoy it I did 32gb cl30 6000 and it's purrrssss.",Neutral
AMD,"First a lot of people are going to give you smoke because your CPU is way more capable than your GPU, but I know how it goes.  I have a very similar setup created by a very lucky buying window on the CPU and the terrible GPU market earlier this year.  So I get how things can be uneven.  Basically you have two options neither are good.  First is to try to suck it up and deal with what you have and hope prices relax.  Depending on what you do exactly it might be sufficient.  I am not a psychic I can't tell you if or when prices might relax, but I don't think anyone sees that happening soon.  But you said Star Citizen, which I believe is a bit of a RAM hog, and if you're doing a lot of strategy/sims it'll probably suck with 16 GB.  If you were mostly playing older games people still play you'd be fine and dandy.  Incidentally even if you are bottlenecked on the GPU, one cool thing about having the 9800X3D is you will rarely see stutter or really slow turns in games.  I play Baldur's Gate 3 on a machine with a 9800X3D and another with a 9600X, the latter still performs really well and is nothing to scoff at, but in big fights in the game with lots of participants it can take quite a while to work through an entire turn of combat.  With the former, it breezes through it smoothly and as quick as the game engine can render it every time.  Is that worth the extra money, depends on who you ask I suppose.  But I digress.  Or second option, suck it up and just buy a 2x16 kit somehow, some way.  This is probably what I'd do if I'm being honest.  The one you linked is good, I have built with that product line myself and found it to be very reliable and stable, one neat thing about your situation is with that X3D CPU, you can get away with slightly worse CL36 latency (CL30 is what most people recommend).  That big cache on the X3D chip will usually compensate just fine.  Obviously it depends on the exact scenario but that's one thing you have going for you.  You really won't find it significantly cheaper than that.",Neutral
AMD,"You should be able to build a 2000 pound 9800X3D and 5070ti PC without having to sacrifice on RAM, unless that price includes peripherals.  I'd be reluctant to get a 16GB PC considering the market is set to deal with a shortage for years to come.",Neutral
AMD,"I invested in 128gb last year, I can tell you from personal experience that in most situations, 64gb is great. 32gb can work, depending on your usage, 16gb is just cockblocking your system.",Positive
AMD,"32 gigs of system ram is not optional sadly, especially not with a fucking godzilla tier chip you are buying (you're just leaving so much performance on the table, might as well get a cheaper chip with 2x8gb) here's why:  ddr5 8gb sticks are cut down 16 gigs. they have half as many bank groups so even two sticks of 8 give a ""mini"" version of the single channel experience. genuinely one stick of 16gig can be better than two of 8gb since the smaller sticks are so ass.    also:   absolutely do not ever use all 4 slots on ddr5, unstable as fuck  your ram should ideally be ddr5 6000 CL30 or under. cl36 is not ideal but you take it in this ram shortage.       so even though this looks like im suggesting you to buy one 16gb stick to start with instead of two 8gbs, keep in mind games like marvel rivals absolutely crater when using one stick(almost half fps). most other games however will exhibit 2-5% fps loss. some warn against doing this single channel because you will get horrible 1% lows but in my opinion the massive cache on the x3d chips will smooth that out. to sum up: fuck AI for making ram expensive",Negative

I decided to just get 2 sticks of 8 GB 6400 RAM (cheapest I could find was Patriot ram on ebay) and hope that was enough.  I think you will be fine. I run Cyberpunk at pretty near max settings on 1440p at 80fps. Civ 7 at max settings, and I'm playing Clair Obscur now on whatever the default ""very high"" settings are and have zero issues. I think 16gb is fine for anything out now. 32GB is more for future proofing your build, but I'm planning to get another 16gb when I need it in a year or two, and hopefully prices will be less insane.",Neutral
AMD,"16gb is fine for now. When you do upgrade, personally i’d by 2x16 and sell off your current ones. Buying another 2x8 and taking up all 4 slots means if you do want to upgrade in the future to 64gb it’s gonna be a lot harder.  But if you don’t think you’ll need to upgrade then another 2x8 is also fine",Neutral
AMD,"Depends on the game.  Many games target consoles, so 16gb of ram are actually enough, same for almost every ""old"" game.  That being said, having 32 is ideal, since you might have/want more apps running in the background or you want to play games that actually benefit from more than 16gb of ram (like games made for pc or games with big worlds or simulations of some kind).   For example star citizen kinda want 32+ gb of ram, (streets of) tarkov, i guess many builder/sims (that i don't really play) and more.  That being said, recent games seems to like some more than 16gb and future games probably will as well.  Since prices are insane, if i were you, i'd just play and have fun, you might find some games would run better with more ram, but it's probably not going to be gamebreaking. In the future you can always upgrade.  But as upgrade goes 4 sticks are not reccommended on ddr5, if i were you i'd buy a single stick 16gb (can you change it?) of some ram i can buy one stick later IF i want to upgrade soon. If you plan to upgrade in a year or two or more stick to 8+8 dual channel, you are then going to switch (maybe sell?) all the (2) sticks with new ones to upgrade.",Neutral
AMD,If you have the option you could grab a cheaper CPU and see if that lets you get the more ram.

If you’re not playing competitive games at really high refresh rate then you don’t really need the cpu.

I can't remember and I can't find whether they will continue to provide chips to other companies that use them as their OEM.  If they don't, that will leave only two suppliers of consumer RAM hynix and Samsung",Negative
AMD,Prices will continue to climb in the near term (~1-2 months) until Micron/Samsung/SK Hynix jump back in to sell consumer ram at the newly inflated rates.    I'd wager pricing will likely stabilize within the next 6 months but we probably won't see cheap ram again until ~2028 at the earliest (cheap being around $200 for 64gb cl30).  Ram pricing historically was cyclical and mostly predictable.  This is an off-cycle supply shock so any kind of forecasting now involves a lot of guesswork.,Neutral
AMD,"It’s faster and doesn’t have the buffer limit as a lot of other ram.   https://www.techradar.com/how-to/what-is-non-binary-memory-the-new-ram-configurations-explained  Two module will be better than a single stick, so if you can find a decently priced 2x16 6000 CL36 that’s probably your best option given the RAM market right now.",Positive
AMD,Well actually 16 gb would also do but still I would say get one 16gb stick now and then later when possible get another stick but don't go for 8x2gb sticks,Neutral
AMD,"X3D CPUs are less sensitive to high speed RAM and lower CL latency, so if you find a kit that’s 6000MHz CL36 for a good price go for that. Now, if you had a non-X3D CPU the recommendation was generally 6000MHz CL30 but with prices how they are people will get their hands on whatever they can get.",Neutral
AMD,"I bought many parts used on ebay, current ram is (4x8 ddr4 3600 bought used on ebay for 116 euros... Almost 3 years ago. Wtf).   I have bought many components used, from gpus to nvnes, motherboards... Never had any issue, (good) computer components last usually very long (for drives check sanity stats). Would never buy a used psu tho.  Ram are always easy to sell btw, when out of production people want/need old rams.",Neutral
AMD,"Under normal circumstances, ram is one of the better things to buy second-hand, as it doesn't really wear out with normal usage.  The only issues with buying it now are pricing volatility and scams.  Reselling should be easy in this market.",Positive
AMD,"I have the Gigabyte M27Q3 bought for £250. Literally the perfect solution to all my needs, playing AAA games at ultra settings 120-150FPS looking great in a lit living room then switching to competitive shooters at 300FPS looking smooth and also making the most out of the KVM switch with a work laptop hooked up to the monitor (Hdmi 2.1 to pc, good quality usb-c into the laptop). The only upgrade I would consider for myself is the MO27Q28G tandem w-oled but the extra cost is more than my current monitor so I don’t care to spend even more on my setup atm. I saw you were looking to run 4K but I chose to stay at 1440p.",Positive
AMD,Then I think your CPU is overkill. You will get a CPU bottleneck. You could save money replacing the CPU with a cheaper one and directing it elsewhere. Just my opinion if you are operating with limited wiggle room. That CPU would work great with video editing/processing etc. But for gaming with a 5070ti I don't think it's needed.,Negative
AMD,Because the CPU is overkill for 1440p or 4k.,Neutral
AMD,"If it was up to you which of your suggestions would you go for, also thank you very much for the helpful suggestions :)",Positive
AMD,Yes that is also a good option but only if you're gonna use this 8x2 sick for a long time like at least 6-12 months and then sell them.,Neutral
AMD,"You're extremely lucky.  I could not get 4 X 16gb sticks stable on my 9800X3D rig so I ended up selling my 32gb kit when I went 64gb.  I got it stable at 4800 speeds, but that's dog slow.  It's probably IMC silicon lottery.",Neutral
AMD,"No, if mixing kits of 2 (of otherwise the same spec) using them in the same channel can improve stability. So kit A in slots 1,2 and kit B in slots 3,4. You won't find this in a motherboard manual.  When using just 1 kit obviously you use them in 2,4.",Neutral

AMD,"Ok, good shout thank you so much",Positive
AMD,"Cheers I’ll look in to it, definitely the cheaper option :)",Positive
AMD,"Jesus your monitor looks insane value for money, can see it’s only £240 (less than 32gb ram), definitely might go for that one, 4k would be exciting but idk if it’s affordable :(",Positive
AMD,You mean a GPU bottleneck. Also x3d chips are horrific value for productivity tasks like video editing,Neutral
AMD,Jesus christ,Neutral
AMD,"A new 2x16gb kit will definitely perform better, the kits are guaranteed to match perfectly at their advertised clock speed so that's always the best bet. However, are you sure you need 32gb? I'd run with your 16gb and see if you actually notice RAM handicapping your gaming performance if the price is a concern.",Positive
AMD,"4 DDR5 sticks is barely stable on most AMD rigs.  Not a good idea.  Either save up more now, or plan on selling the 16gb kit later when you upgrade.  The 9800X3D doesn't benefit from fast ram as much as non 3D Cache chips.  I would go with slower 32gb kits.",Negative
AMD,"The cheapest RAM with the best specs for the money.  Brand is largely immaterial, as long as it is a good brand.  The actual RAM chips will be Hynix, Samsung, or Micron",Positive
AMD,"Yeah not sure, I seen a lot of the same experiences by other users on Reddit but ended up getting two of the free 2x8gb Teamgroup Delta ram when you buy a motherboard bundles during Black Friday for $180 total and decided it was worth the risk and so far they seem to be stable at 6000. If that didn’t work it was still a win-win since I was on a 5600x with 16gb 3200mhz ddr4 and upgrading to a better cpu and ram was still worth it.",Neutral
AMD,"Ah, keyword being ""stability"" there, I understand now.",Neutral
AMD,"Just bite the bullet and get 32GB now, you will thank us later.",Positive
AMD,"Yes, unfortunately it's already kind of late as ram prices more than doubled, some cases quadrupled in the last few months   If you already have the 2x8 installed then my recommendation would be to buy the 32 GB kit and sit on it as long as you can before the return window closes. If prices start dropping, return it for cheaper, if they go up then you already have it at the current price.  I bought 64 GB of RAM back in July for $215... and now it is selling for $880, if there's any in stock.",Negative
AMD,Don't listen to those. people. You don't need low CL RAM with X3D CPU.,Negative
AMD,"Just as a disclaimer the monitor’s not perfect: it is slightly dimmer near the edges, especially the bottom edge reported by a few people and me. However, I’ve been playing expedition 33 (lots of dark scenes/high contrast scenes) and I have never noticed anything off except when I look at black screen with lights turned off/doing grayscale tests. I’ve not had issues during regular use.  When it comes to 4k it’s doable on 5070Ti if you drop your graphics preset and use upscaling, but I thought I’m not paying £1800 to have to play anything but ultra setting (usually with dlss quality since I cannot see any difference and it’s free fps for me). Up to you, lots of people swear by 4k fidelity over graphics preset or fps.",Neutral
AMD,Where did you find it for £240? It’s selling for £280 on amazon right now. Be careful because there are many monitors with similar names like m27q2 qd which is the 200Hz quantum dot version going for £240. The m27q3 is the high refresh rate one overclocking up to 320Hz.,Neutral
AMD,And would that be another 2x8 or a new 2x 16,Neutral
AMD,AMDs IMC isn’t great with 4x some people have reported it working but I wouldn’t count on it especially with mismatched kits,Negative
AMD,"2x16... 4x8 could cause problems   If you already have the two both by 2x8 in the computer then take it out and keep an eye on prices, if they start to go down sell it they start to go up hang on to it and sell it for more.",Neutral
AMD,New 2x16 is better,Positive
AMD,I give it around a 70 to 80% chance of 4x8 working properly.   2x16 is more like 99+%   This assumes DDR5-6000,Neutral
AMD,Ya,Neutral
AMD,Yeah I reckon so,Neutral
AMD,"It’ll be fine, I’m using a 4070 super with my 5600X at 1440p and it’s great. But I just purchase a 9800X3D bundle to upgrade to as my 5600X has served me well for almost 5 years and is showing its age in more CPU intensive new releases.",Positive

AMD,"Oh wow that's great man, enjoy your upgrade! Thanks for the reply!",Positive
AMD,"Do not wait for the Super series - they are highly unlikely to happen at this point, as AI/data center demand for memory is screwing the entire consumer market over right now.  Buy a GPU now if you're thinking about it.",Negative
AMD,"There likely no super series for the 50 series. Also could very easily see nvidia cut production of consumer GPU to shift more towards data center customers. Grab a 5070ti for $750 and be very happy for the next few years imo. (Or the AMD card, also great)",Positive
AMD,"There's a very slim chance, if any at all, for super series to be coming anymore",Neutral
AMD,Supers might not come. There’s rumors of the 5060 ti 16 gb being discontinued due to ram. If you might move to Linux. 9070xt.,Neutral
AMD,NVIDIA drivers on linux are kinda eh so AMD will be a better fit if you’re thinking about the linux route. Can’t go wrong with either tho since they’re both great cards. Def buy a gpu soon cause they are at a reasonable price right now compared to ram and who knows what 2026 will entail. Good luck!,Positive
AMD,Buddy.  Nvidia is reducing output and production next year. Starting with low end cards.  Get the best you can now or wait to ride out the storm if the card you have now is good enough.,Negative
AMD,"Dude if you've seen what's happening lately I'd buy now! Idk if GPU prices will spike but storage and RAM, rumors of them slashing production on gaming consumer cards, super series cancelled rumors. It's too uncertain, and it can be had for MSRP for now:  https://www.microcenter.com/product/693841/zotac-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-solid-sff-overclocked-triple-fan-16gb-gddr7-pcie-50-graphics-card",Negative
AMD,"6 months ago the ""wait for supers"" advice was a consideration. Since then prices on everything has shot up and supply can't keep up with data center demand. Supers are quite likely to be canceled or crippled at this point.  9070xt - rasterization/Linux 5070ti - features/ai creation  Most people say that the 5070ti is worth maybe $50-100 more than 9070xt",Negative
AMD,"I somewhat panic bought a 5070ti over the weekend when I found the one I was after for £700. Prices may not rise but after seeing what happened with ram recently I don’t wanna chance it. Very happy running path tracing at 1440 in cyberpunk with a lil dlss help, looks phenomenal.",Negative
AMD,Rx 9070 xt is much better value. Rtx 5070ti is like 7% faster and costs 30% more. That is like hugh price gap for little performance so would chose rx 9070xt everyday.,Positive
AMD,9070xt is better value if you don't care about ray tracing and as for new video card they will definitely cost more since the ram crisis,Negative
AMD,"I feel like there are 1000 of these posts a day, the threads are pretty redundant..  To answer your question I think the 5070ti is the best price/performance card right now. 9700xt is also probably great but I think DLSS4 and frame gen make the 5070ti worth the extra money.   Before the past couple of months, GPUs were pretty much impossible to buy for a somewhat decent price for a long time. So who knows what the market will look like years from now when you want to upgrade. From what I’ve seen of DLSS4 and frame gen, I think they can easily add an extra couple of years of viability to the 50 series cards and that might come in clutch.   If you have a micro center within an hour from you I would just check to see if they have one open box every morning. I got mine for $675.",Neutral
AMD,"I wouldn’t wait for supers that might never come, and in the UK I wouldn’t pay the Nvidea premium. 9070 xt Saphire Pulse was £540 before Xmas on Amazon. Might go down to that again in the Boxing Day sales, but often around MSRP these days.   5070 ti is usually around £700, but have seen it dip under sometimes. Still too much of a margin though for not enough benefit. At least if you’re primarily thinking about gaming.",Neutral
AMD,"If you can deal with DLSS upscaling -- and I don't know why you shouldn't be able to deal with it -- I would just just get a 5070 Ti now if you want to play games now. On top of the other scarcity issues, you'd likely have to deal with the same scarcity-inflated prices that the non-super cards had at first.  And for what, extra VRAM for playing at 4K without DLSS upscaling? Just set aside the money you'd save in a bond fund until you're ready for the next upgrade, or use the money to buy shares of VXUS that you'll hold until you retire.",Negative
AMD,"The two cards are fairly evenly matched; the 9070xt has better raster performance and solid RT performance while usually being cheaper. The 5070ti has slightly better RT and upscaling performance along with lower power draw, but is usually significantly more expensive. In my market (UK), the AMD card is usually around £100 cheaper (depending on sales/offers), making it much better value.",Neutral

AMD,Two questions.  1. Do you really care THAT much about raytracing?  2. Are you willing to spend probably an extra few hundred next year because prices will sky-rocket.   AMD beats out nvidia this gun in raw performance. RT is obviously nvidia's cup of tea and if you're gonna switch to Linux definitely go amd for the compatibility.,Negative
AMD,"I've been agonising over this decision, too. I pulled the trigger and bought a 5070 Ti a few days ago and I do not regret it at all. Amidst all the rumours and price rises, I thought it's now or never. There might be a Super series or there might not, but either way I can play everything I want to now and for the next few years.

AMD,"I have the 9070xt on a 1440p widescreen, use bazzite, and really like it. Raytracing (especially path tracing) on linux is not as performant as it is on windows, but they seem to be catching up. Modern nvidia cards should work really well on linux right now. The big issue between the two companies is AMD's linux drivers are open sourced and maintained by a lot of large companies and individuals, ie valve, intel, even microsoft I heard, while Nvidia's drivers are not fully open sourced. If Nvidia decides not to contribute to their linux drivers, well.... you are out of luck. For flexibility I would go 9070xt, for bleeding edge RT and upscaling I would go nvidia. For 1440p at least, I don't feel like I need those advanced features. 4k maybe? If I were really into ray tracing I might get nvidia?",Positive

AMD,"Originally I was leaning heavily toward the 9070xt. I upgraded from a 7700xt and liked the cost performance of AMD but… then I tried cyberpunk for the first time with ray tracing and decided I wanted that wherever I could lol. I think 5070ti is about 5% more powerful on average and the larger market share for NVIDIA feels like I’m less likely to encounter any quirks in games as I get the impression more optimisation is weighted toward nvidia, also DLSS seems to atm be slightly ahead of AMDs but sounds like that gap is closing more and more",Positive
AMD,"Good prices right now actually, check Newegg .. a lot under MSRP including Sapphire Nitro+ that's only $699 new",Positive
AMD,"Try to get one when you can and check your power supply as most of 9070xt require 850w and some 9070xt may draw abit more power.  Since you are on AM4 , I assume you build this PC yrs ago and the wear and tear on the powersupply may not be stable for a 9070xt",Neutral

He said to ignore the Zotac because it was a pos.  I’ve heard this being said about zotac before, even 5 years ago already. So I don’t have a hard time believing him.   So right now I’m set on the Prime. I don’t want to overclock anyway. Generally I set a low fan curve and undervolt my gpu a bit so.

I'd go with 32GB if you can afford it, or 16GB if you don't want to pay for 32GB.  After you get the GPU, upgrade the CPU to an R5 5600X or higher, or swap platforms. If you plan to swap platforms anytime soon, get 16GB of RAM for now. If you want to make the most out of AM4, try to go for an R5 5800X3D and 32GB of DDR4. If you do swap platforms, go for an R5 7500F or an R5 7600X/9600X (they are the same price; mainly availability is the difference, and the 9600X uses slightly less power).  Also, for the power supply, ensure your current wattage is enough for the entirety of the build.",Neutral

AMD,"Thanks for the advice, what do you think is the best place to pick up DDR4?",Positive
AMD,"If you can afford 32GB go for it, otherwise 16 will do fine for now, definitely an improvement from 8",Positive
AMD,"The motherboard you currently have is fine, unless there's an issue you are having with it; otherwise, keep it as is.  Unless you mean for a platform swap, the Asus Prime B650 WiFi is always my go-to. I've never had an issue with them, and they look good for a good price.",Positive
AMD,"Whichever place has the cheapest price. Don't forget to factor in postage if you're ordering online. Might be best to check out PC Part Picker to see what vendor is currently cheapest, although they mostly don't tend to vary by more than 5% in my experience.",Neutral

AMD,"A 5500 is a good CPU, but the 5600X is a noticeably better one. Look on Amazon. The stock cooler should be enough for it. If you want some reassurance, the Hyper 212 is a good $19 cooler.  Unless, of course, you already have a sufficient cooler.",Positive
AMD,I found one for 223 on amazon which is a bit of a jump lol. I'll probably go for the 5500 and I have zero idea what my cooler is so I'll most likely pick the Hyper 212 up as well,Neutral

AMD,"Yeah, it seems like somewhat of an understatement.",Negative
AMD,"It's good news all around, especially in this era where hardware shortages and the accompanying price hikes make people instinctively want to hold onto what they have for as long as possible.  Moreover, having viable alternatives to Windows when Microsoft seems dead set on forcing its user base to sunset perfectly good hardware for nebulous benefits is also a good thing.",Positive
AMD,"Definitely, with windows 10 being end of support and if the computer is unsupported on windows 11, you don’t really have a better option",Negative
AMD,"There is essentially a distro for any needs. I wanted something newer and gaming focused, ended up getting Pop!_OS rather than having my PC running Windows 11 when I bought these parts earlier this year… never going back",Negative
AMD,What if I play counter strike?,Neutral
AMD,"You shouldn’t have any problems, it’s been supported natively on Linux for a while.",Positive
AMD,"Runs natively on Linux a lot better now than at the launch. A lot of it is down to the poor nvidia driver performance at times causing problems for folks with their GPUs, but there are plenty of additional optimisation guides available for this now (because yay for being able to customise your system). One other reason why I like AMD GPUs is the driver stack works so well on Linux.",Positive
AMD,Yeah but I play faceit because I can't deal with cheating infested premier,Negative
AMD,The 5060 by a fair margin because it’s more recent and has access to newer technology. What price are they though?

AMD,"Okay for only 70 more i would definetly stick with the Ryzen System. CPU is ~10% faster based on what you play, sometimes the Intel is faster, but overall Ryzen +~10%. The RX 7700 and RTX 5060 should be on the same performance level. But the RX 7700 has double the VRAM of the RTX 5060.

AMD,Any B850 or x870 should work great for you.,Positive
AMD,"First put a ring on. Second if you return that for 14th gen cpu,she should leave you. As for motherboards you want an b850 or x870. B850s are what most people go abd you find some extremely good options around the 200 dollar price point. Entering else you can just transfer over including the ram.

AMD,"I don't know about Mobos, but I know that you should marry her, good luck with everything.",Positive
AMD,11th gen intel is not compatible with a Z790 motherboard. 11th gen Intel is LGA 1200 while the Z790 is LGA 1700.,Neutral
AMD,"I was thinking to myself “Would I really return this for another intel” It’s just a bit much thinking about replacing my motherboard since I upgraded it 2/3 years ago.  I am jonesing to use this though, as my current cpu is pretty mediocre",Neutral
AMD,You’re right it’s 12th,Neutral
AMD,It’s 12th,Neutral
AMD,Well if you want facts to help you make the right decision  then a 9950x3d is better you would get from the 14th gen intel. You dont have to worry about any oxidation problems from amd like you do with 14th gen intels. Lga 1700 is a dead socket and am5 is still going to be current for a few years.,Neutral

AMD,"That would make me feel very dumb for recently buying one on the used market 🥲 but holy shit, would be nice if it happened.   Problem is how the process is and how the chips are binned, could they really get enough yield to make it worth their while vs paying to flood the market with lower binned chips nobody wants to buy",Negative

AMD,I have the 5900x. Wonder if it’s worth it to get a 5800x3d if the release more,Neutral
AMD,Can’t believe I got $120 AliExpress 5700X3D a year ago,Neutral
AMD,What's that going to do outside of busy fabs that are already committed to other products?   The issue is that we don't have enough chip making things. Going back and making a line that's already retired doesn't solve the issue of not enough chip factories.   All it does is repurpose already strained to meet demand factories to meet some new demand that wasn't planned on.,Negative
AMD,i think that's why they launched the 5800XT. but yeah if they re-release a AM4 x3d chip would be cool. would be nice for my secondary system.,Positive
AMD,Here I am stuck with a 5600x. Next time I upgrade I'm buying the top fucking cpu. This bs will never happen to me again.,Negative
AMD,Fabs already moved on.. why would they go backwards.    They won't  Deal with it.,Negative

AMD,It's not gonna happen. Buy a 5800XT while you still can.,Negative
AMD,that’s like the struggle of my life trying to upgrade without going broke as hell,Negative
AMD,"I doubt it. That would also mean reversing their directive to wind down AM4 motherboards while the ram cartel winds down DDR4 production altogether.  They already reversed the wind down of the B650, so the win-win scenario for them, board makers, and the ram cartel would be for everyone to still switch to the lower AM5 CPUs.",Neutral
AMD,And to think i was gonna go with a 5600 before is said fuck it and pulled then trigger on the 5800x3d,Negative

AMD,"Dear AMD, bring us a 5950x3d for Xmas. Thank you",Positive
AMD,BAHAHA AM4 WILL NEVER DIE,Positive
AMD,"I mean, from AMDs perspective they could, but how long would it take to actually get them back in production again? Will there still be demand for them in that time, and would it not be more cost effective to just keep making AM5 chips, or make an AM5 refresh that can use DDR4?",Neutral
AMD,Ddr4 stock will be out by  the end of the month... this is just false hope imo.,Negative

AMD,"That chip is fucking immortal :D   Glad I switched my 2600 to 5800X3D back in a day, and held myself on jumping to AM5",Positive
AMD,They could make a 5850x3d but instead of being a binned version like 9850x3d make it like the 9800x3d with the cache on the bottom and unlock overclocking.  Would probably sell for the price of a 9800x3d,Neutral
AMD,Ryzen 9 5900X3D would be Fire XD,Neutral
AMD,I was called a madman when i bought a 5700x3d so late into am4's life,Neutral
AMD,"It’s good and all, but to do that would take time, and their yields might be questionable too. It’s not like they can just click a button and there’s a million 5800X3Ds 😅",Negative
AMD,I thought about buying a 5800X3D last year so I could upgrade my main CPU and put my current one in a machine still running a 1700 but I figured I'd wait a little longer for the price to go down. Boy that sure was a mistake.,Negative

AMD,Gamer und reviewer fordern. Das ist in etwa so wie wenn der Steuerzahler etwas fordert.,Neutral
AMD,"Würde für AMD keinen Sinn machen. Bei den meisten AM4 Prozessoren wurden die CCD zwar von TSMC gefertigt, die IO DIEs aber von Globalfundries in Amerika gefertigt und anschließend in Dresden im BTF fertig gestellt. Da AMD erstens kein Kunde mehr von Globalfundries ist (sie müssten die Konditionen neu verhandeln) und Globalfundries auch nicht mehr das BTF in Dresden hat (wurde Ende letzten Jahres geschlossen und die Tools verkauft so wie die Leute in der Abteilung gekündigt oder in andere versetzt) wäre der Aufwand sehr groß für CPUs von einer ""toten"" Platform wo die Leute ja auch für eine neue CPU trotzdem nicht extrem viel Geld ausgeben wollen. Das Risiko wäre viel zu groß daß man sehr viel Geld investiert um am Ende als die gute Firma wahrgenommen zu werden. Es gibt keine Garantie das AMD damit so viel Geld verdienen würde das Investoren und Manager zufrieden wären. Klar würde ich das auch cool finden um meinen 3700x zu tauschen, aber es wird leider nicht passieren.",Neutral

PC market is always messed up. It seemed to be stable after the GPU thing - but naah, les go with the RAM now.",Negative
AMD,Ça ne serait pas plus simple de produire une carte mère am5 avec des slots supplémentaires en DDR4 !?,Neutral
AMD,"Why? Nobody is making ddr4 anymore.  Once inventory is out, it will. E more expensive than ddr5.",Negative
AMD,I feel that it makes more sense to just buy ddr5 and a mid tier am5 chip than build on outdated sockets. Seems like a short term fix for a long term endeavour. It takes 3 core components being outdated for relatively minuscule savings overall.,Negative
AMD,I honestly cannot fathom how people are paying 400+ for this when you can just sell your current AM4 cpu/mobo and buy a 14600k/Z690 DDR4 board for way less than the 5800x3d.,Negative
AMD,"Yeah DDR5 prices are still pretty brutal, makes sense why people want to squeeze more life out of their AM4 builds instead of doing a full platform jump",Negative
AMD,I already have a 5800X3D but i think i would upgrade to a 5950X3D,Neutral
AMD,DDR4 is also stupid expensive and not that much cheaper though,Negative
AMD,Seems to me that chips that don’t make the 5700/5800x3d bins will still be in demand considering the tech shortages could last years.,Neutral
AMD,The 5700x3d's are just 5800x3d's that didn't meet the performance benchmark. If they revived the 5800x3d they'd also be reviving the 5700x3d as a result of that.,Neutral
AMD,Ddr4 is really not being produced at scale anymore. Once people start buying DDR4 systems the price will explode just like ddr5.,Negative
AMD,why not both?,Neutral
AMD,Or even take a play from AM5 and make a 5850X3D,Neutral
AMD,I had a 5950x and went to a 5800x3d and it improved my 1% lows in most games and some games got a boost of average FPS too. It is just for gaming not for any other tasks so it was absolutely worth it for me.,Positive
AMD,If only there was a free search engine you could type that into?,Neutral
AMD,That was a good price. I paid around $165 in January. Crazy what they are going for now,Positive
AMD,"I almost bought one myself. I hesitated and then the price started going up.  Oh well, my 5600x is good enough for me I guess. If AMD wants to make more at that price range, I'm totally in, however.",Neutral
AMD,Demand for ryzen 9000 series will drop off if ddr5 ram is either prohibitively expensive or not available for a good while,Negative
AMD,I am doing my first PC build and I went with the 5800XT. It would be awesome to see more AM4 X3d chips with how RAM prices are.,Positive
AMD,Are you having issues with it? My 5600X still runs everything I can possibly throw at it without any issue.,Neutral
AMD,"Me too, might have to find a discounted pre built",Neutral
AMD,I'm just here on a i3 12100F. I'd love to go AM4 but the cost of doing so puts me at i5 13400/i5 14400 prices just for a sidegrade to an R5 5500 + B550.,Neutral
AMD,Because ddr5 ram shortage is going to eat into demand for am5 processors in new builds... Meanwhile there's a healthy amount of am4 boards that already have ddr4 ram in them and could use an upgrade.   The design work is already done and the nodes they are made on are still in operation.,Neutral
AMD,"I did too, but prices had already went stupid and not worth it for a fractional upgrade.",Negative
AMD,"Kann ich mir vorstellen, im gebraucht bereich liegt das interesse dort eher im 350€-400€.",Neutral
AMD,"It's about getting some cash out of existing AM4 users. They largely wouldn't be buying new or more memory, just replacing an existing CPU because upgrading to AM5 and DDR5 is going to be incredibly expensive for the next few years at least.  So they can get no money in the next few years from people like myself where I will opt to sit on my 3600 because DDR5 prices are insane, or they could manufacture some AM4 chips, and maybe it's worth upgrading to that. Re-starting manufacturing isn't cheap though so I'm sure they'd really have to run the numbers to decide if it's worth it. Maybe once AM5 sales start to plummet they will.",Neutral
AMD,Because a LOT of people are still on AM4. I'd bet more than AM5.,Neutral

AMD,"if you are primarily gaming not worth it, technically a downgrade for gaming if memory serves right",Neutral
AMD,"There are rumors of a 9850x3d with dual v-cache. They could make a dual v-cache am4 chip as well and cash out on the am4 renaissance.  I don't know if it's possible, but if they could do bottom-side V-cache on an am4 like they do on am5, it could let the am4 x3d chips reach 5ghz instead of their current 4ghz. Would be a MASSIVE boost to everyone in am4. Honestly I think a 5850x3D with bottom side cache could probably match a 7800x3d at least.",Positive
AMD,Prob 5900x3d would be more practical.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, but people who already own AM4 systems also already own DDR4 memory.",Neutral
AMD,"Not necessarily.  The 5800X3D became economically irrelevant for AMD. It was expensive *and* it was being beaten by the 7700X on AM5, which was both easier to make, and outselling it.  From analysing assembly dates, AMD appears to have ordered two, possibly three, batches of Vermeer-X/Milan-X. AMD used pre-tested, known good, Vermeer dies for the chip stacking process: **Every last one of them** was 100%, high clocking, the best dies TSMC had made.  I bought this 5700X3D in June 2025 for just over £200, it went end of life not long later. The date code on it was week 9 **2024**. AMD was making these in batches, not in serial production. Go google up some pics of the CPUs, you'll see the date codes cluster in two major groups with a possible third one.  Given that they were pre-tested dies, all of them able to clock and scale voltage at the very best of what Vermeer was ever capable of, the choice of whether it was sold as a 5600X3D, 5700X3D, or 5800X3D was a purely economic one.",Neutral
AMD,"5700x3d is exteme hard to overclock even to 4,2ghz.",Negative
AMD,"It's really for people who already have an AM4 system with a slow CPU, and already have DDR4 RAM who can no longer afford an AM5/DDR5 system. It's a big performance jump over the the 1000-3000 series and 5000 non-x3D",Neutral
AMD,Consumer DDR5 also isn't being produced at much of a scale anymore either so may as well get what performance is possible from the socket people already have memory for.,Neutral
AMD,"Reviving the 5800x3d would offer a good upgrade for people on AM4. No new DDR4 required. Additionally, there's still a decent supply of used DDR4.",Positive
AMD,Im on a 5800x3d. Id welcome a new am4 with open arms. Riding the am4 wave till 2030….,Positive
AMD,"All I can contribute is the 5700x3D is the most consistent and stable system I've ever had, love it.",Positive
AMD,Certain games really benefit from the extra L3 cache - Escape from Tarkov and Star Citizen being two that instantly come to mind.,Neutral
AMD,Go check out some of the charts form Gamers Nexus from when it came out. You can find charts with both chips.  I have what you have and found out about the x3d from it being announced they were stopping production.  It's a clear gain. I think people say around 20%. Which was pretty nice at the pre-scarcity price.,Neutral
AMD,Same. Bought the 5900x before x3d even exists. FPS wise it doesn’t look much of a difference but I think the 1% improves which I’m hoping improve monster hunters wild,Neutral
AMD,"I went from a 5600X to a 5700X3D - average FPS was a little bit better, but nothing eye opening. However the 1% lows improved massively and general frame time was much more consistent.   I especially noticed this in VR performance for sim racing where inconsistent frame rates and frame times are immediately noticeable.   While the 5600X is technically a faster CPU, in both base and turbo clock frequencies, the additional cache of the 5700X3D made a huge difference for the games I play. The fact that I also gained two cores really isn’t that much of a factor. I originally went from a 3800X to a 5600X and the reduction of cores, from 8 to 6, had no negative impact on gaming performance.",Positive

AMD,"Got my 5800x3d for $300 last month and that was a fair price on used market. Still expensive for last gen but less then nee cpu, mobo and ram",Neutral
AMD,"The issue is bringing back 5700x3d on say the back of the current running 5500x3d would change binning.  And it might not come back at a price point people are willing to purchase.  It really depends on the facility.  If the fab they're doing 5500x3d can't produce enough yield to bin a decent amount of 5700x3d, there's no point, supply would be so low that price wouldn't match consumer expectation.  It really depends on where each line is being fabricated, but if the machine they're doing the 5500x3d can't hit yields high enough to produce enough bin for another SKU, it's just not going to be smart to start binning on something that the final price to consumer will just drive them away.",Negative
AMD,"Outside of workstation tasks and some specific CPU-heavy games, 5600X is just fine. I mostly game, so I made the small upgrade to a 5700X3D to make my AM4 build relevant for a little while longer, but it’s not that big of a lift over a 5600X, 10-20% lift at most, not worth it unless you’re just trying to eek out some more performance and you can justify the price over swapping to AM5, which is different for each person.",Positive
AMD,I listened to all the tech tubers saying a 5600x is all you need for gaming like 5 years ago. Now I realize cpus have a longer shelf life and I would be in a much better place if I had at least gotten a 5800x or 5900x.  It just sucks wanting to upgrading but not being able to because of ram. Sometime in the next 2 years when ram prices drop I'm building a beast.,Negative
AMD,Same. I’m actually on the regular 5600 and it does just fine with my 9060 XT. Hardware Canucks actually has a couple of videos comparing how older CPU’s hold up with modern GPU’s and the results lean towards pretty well with the 5000-series.

AMD,Nah bud save your money. I also got a 5800x on release before X3D you won’t get massive gains. Just ride the 5800X into the sunset and pray the market cools.,Neutral
AMD,"No huge gains outside of some asset-heavy games like simulations and anything that needs to preload large textures or other intensive processes, so some capability gain for workstation tasks. The downside is a lower TDP and a lower overall clock speed.",Negative
AMD,"I did the same, and upgraded to an x3d the day it came out; For me it's night and day in MMO's, where developers can't fully control scenes, and thus, there's an increased chance of dips.  It's a bit slower on top the top end, but much, much more stable in the 1% and .1% lows.",Neutral

AMD,I’m still rocking my heater/ i9 9900kf from 2019!,Neutral
AMD,"If we're talking about the regular X version, yes. The 5950X3D doesn't exist but one could dream.",Neutral
AMD,Exactly. I’m sitting on 6 or 7 sets of DDR4 from when it was cheap cheap. Also my itx portable is still AM4 so an upgrade for it would be nice.,Positive
AMD,"It is, considering how long and in quantity the 5800X3D was made. The 5800X3D launched first, and was produced for months before the 5700X3D hit the market",Neutral
AMD,"Cache affects game performance kinda like not having enough RAM does. In some games it makes almost no difference, but in a few games it's like 50-70% improvement. If there are specific games you play a lot, try looking up benchmarks for the X3D chips for those games specifically.  If you play a lot of different games, then I'd say it's probably not worth worrying about it.",Neutral
AMD,Even if am4 chips would cost same as am5 people would buy it cause they don’t need new ram and mobo for it. And for instance if you go from 3600 to 5800x3d that’s a huge boost without platform change.,Neutral
AMD,"It's not a problem if the 5600X still does everything you need it to, which for me it does. Obsessing over tiny gains and upgrades isn't worth it.",Neutral
AMD,Same! Tho I have regular i9-9900. It's still a pretty decent CPU to be honest.,Positive
AMD,"A 5950X3D would essentially be one 5800X3D and one regular 5800X glued together. For gaming, you'd get the best performance by disabling the non-X3D die which would turn the CPU into a 5800X3D.  The only advantage of such a part would be that you get 16 cores for productivity tasks, while still getting access to 8 cores with 3D V-Cache for gaming.",Positive
AMD,"> Even if am4 chips would cost same as am5  I mean that's a big if.  It really depends on what kind of yields they can get on the machine that does the 5500x3d.  If they're getting low yields for 5700x3d on the the machine, there's not much point to binning as such.  Given the 5500 74mm² and the 800 standard wafer, that's like ~890 dies per wafer if none are bad.  If each wafer is only yielding 10% or less dies that can be binned 5700x3d, it's going to be more than the AM5 equal in cost.  So at least 90 or more of those have to meet the 5700 testing.  And my guess is that they settled on 5500x3d because they were hitting high 90% yield for that chip and not much more for anything else.  The Zen3 is arrange in 2x4 for the cores, so they must be hitting high for 6 of 8 coming through and really, really low for all eight.  The difference between 5700x3d and 5800x3d binning is the later hits higher stable clocks.  The 5700x3d is just functionally a 5800x3d that's got a few issues so running it at lower clocks keeps it stable.  But the 5500x3d is two cores died during production.  So it might be hard for them to hit 8 for 8 enough times to bin 10% of the wafer into a 5700x3d SKU on the machine they have the 5500x3d on.  And the 5500 isn't being produced on the main money maker fabs, that's always the latest gen that it's tooled for.  So 6 for 8 is maybe as best this machine they're running on can do and 8 for 8 is pushing it too hard.  I don't know, depends on the location and what they've got going.  But to retool one of the big boys that have great batting averages to run an AM4 platform is silly talk.  It'd take a ton of time to do so and disrupt so much we'd have another disruptive chip stocking issue.  I don't know AMD's specific numbers, but I can only imagine that they'd need some high 8 for 8 yield for it to be equal in price to the current AM5.  There's likely a specific reason they selected the 5500x3d as 6 for 8 and at the price point they've put it at.  My guess is that they're getting high yields on the machine they're using for two busted cores, high enough that the 5500 can be at the price it's at and it make sense to keep an AM4 around still.  Again, if the DDR5 makes an issue for the 9000s and AMD actually cares about the consumer platform, then it's just easier to use some dollars to have some of the higher demand consumers for DDR5 to ease up a bit and let some flow into consumers.  A whole lot easier than trying to push a machine to justify binning the 5700 SKU.  And vastly easier than trying to retool one of the machines it used to be on, back to doing that platform.",Neutral

AMD,"Yeah, it really depends on the length of the ""DDR5 drama"" which that's what I'm going to call this now.  I've taken it, you can't stop me.  But the thing is, given what I've heard with folks like Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix, these aren't temporary changes, these are structural shifts in production.  *Money into data centers has crossed some sort of threshold that things like consumer PCs aren't profitable any more.  There just simply isn't enough sales in consumer PCs to justify the production before.*  Honestly, this gets into the economics part that I have very little knowledge on.  So, take anything I have to say in the above with a massive grain of salt.  But the main makers of DDR5 RAM are doing things that are big shifts away from the way it used to be done.  Reasons for why they're doing that I can only guess, but those may be bad guesses.  So the DDR5 drama may have a much longer duration.  I don't know, but the kinds of shifts they're doing aren't common.  But at the same time, it may mean a massive shift for the AM5 platform and software developers.  Chip makers issue a thing called ""Last Time To Buy"" LTBs.  The main producers of DDR4 have LTBs already.  The last ""raw"" DDR4 chips will be sold by major makers up to Dec. 31st.  After that, there's no more being made by the major makers.  But the big three aren't the only ones who make these.  There's Nanya, Winbond, and the Chinese CXMT.  They have yet to announce LTBs for their chips.  Again, I'm guessing here.  Just pulling shit out my ass here.  *But we all know how like Chinese CPUs are like a gen or two behind the leading gen?  I have a feeling that's going to be the entire consumer PC market.  Like what they're using in data centers is like two gens ahead of everyone else.  I think the DDR5 drama is just the correction to that state, but I have a sinking feeling, the situation that China has with their homegrown CPUs, will be what everyone who is a consumer will be in soon enough.*",Neutral

AMD,"Did you try changing your windows power settings to Performance? It'll lock the CPU clocks at max even when your PC is idle. Best of all, no need to buy new parts.  For a more costly option, upgrade the GPU... the more power connectors needed, the better. Ideally the card will take up the full length of the case, and block 3+ expansion slots. (larger heatsink means it has more heat that needs to be dissipated)",Positive
AMD,"I regret it because I've been chasing transient issues for about two years and finally after swapping the mobo, ram, m.2, and trying both windows and Linux, realized it was a cpu issue. Now it is RMA'd and I'm waiting for a replacement. Doesn't feel great to pay $550 for something and basically never use it",Negative

AMD,They aren't efficient but Intel still is a pretty fast CPU. I like my 13700k as a jack of all trades CPU. I get some people got unlucky with failures and that would suck but mine has been good for 2 years. AMD's high end CPUs also put out some heat too.

AMD,This does not compute!,Neutral
AMD,"On a 14900k you set the load lite level to 4-5 and tdp short and long to 90-125w, and you can game anything on max with cpu temp between 48-58c (with aio). You lose some performance but its negligible. Cyberpunk modded full path tracing, both gpu (70-80% tdp) and cpu around 52-56c on 4k and fans on silent (<800rpm barely any noise). 60 real fps, 200+ with frame gen.   Modern hardware is so good but so inefficient. Cut those power limits, you dont need that heat.   I prefer a cool and quiet system, and I'm happy to sacrifice 5fps for that.",Neutral

AMD,"Dunno, if I increase PBO clock limit on my 9800X3D it's a pretty spicy heater too. You should try increasing its clock and power limits. Happy warming :D",Positive
AMD,nested virtualization on win10 and thunderbolt are the only reason I can think of why you’d want intel,Neutral

Im still fairly happy with the laptop for 400 Euro total if you ignore the fact I had to buy an extra 16Gb 3200Mhz stick because for some bizarre reason when selecting between the 8Gb and 16Gb variant the 16Gb just means one single-channel stick, and even with full dual-channel memory the iGPU is usually bottlenecked, especially in games with lots of particle effects.

AMD,Yea I agree. Both chips are pretty solid honestly. There are workflows that AMD wins but more that intel wins. At the high end you will get a good workhorse from either brand. The whole “other team bad” schtick is over done on this sub. That said if one chip saves you a second or two in your program of choice get that one.

AMD,Intels are still decent for gaming. It is a situation where you would need to be running a 4090 at 1080p to really see the big difference. I think the comparison is more like a car with a gas guzzling V8 compared to a more fuel efficient car with a turbo. It isn't like the FX days where the FX chips were slow as well as hot.,Neutral
AMD,At times it does feel like people shit on other products because they are slightly slower than the current best. Happens with a lot of hobbies.  There are so many metrics we can use to compare products that it is easy to get lost in the data. I read a comment in this thread that stated the 14900k is the best for gaming with DDR4 memory.

AMD,"Z2E is rdna 3.5, which is just a refined rdna 3.  Rdna 4 is significantly more efficient than rdna 3.

So a hypothetical rdna4+ 6core 16cu handheld would have >2x performance to the OG steamdeck.",Positive

AMD,"Only 3 and a half years after the last Windows driver version for these cards and Linux has *almost* caught up to the same performance. Yeah, great example.",Positive
AMD,If that happens companies will make use of it. Without it those who release on Linux will have to bend the knee and release their games without kernel level access.  I'd rather not play a game than let it touch my kernel level.,Negative
AMD,"No, that shit doesn’t belong in either Linux or Windows",Negative
AMD,Kernel level anticheat is something the game companies choose to do not something the Linux ecosystem needs to implement. Eac for example works on Linux as an anticheat officially . I have over 4k games in my steam account and none of them need kernel level anticheat. I can play all of them under linux. That is more than enough without giving kernel level access to a company like riot(for example) to have literally more privileges than me on my own pc at all times. People have accepted some extremely invasive measures from companies to play their multiplayer games. Cheating sucks I get it but the way they have implemented the solution is unacceptable imho,Negative
AMD,"And when that happens something else will be a hard stop for you that will be ""and then I'll switch""  let's be serious for a moment, you can just say you won't switch. It's not bad inherently bad, it's only bad if you don't have a valid reason which this excuse gives you until the next one",Negative
AMD,"You just want to run rootkits on your machine, huh? Better you never use Linux than we get that garbage implemented.",Negative

AMD,"This is my biggest irritation with the Linux gaming enthusiasts whenever they talk about benchmarks being so good on Linux.  They never compare them to Windows unless it's close or in Linux's favor, nor do they ever address the GPUs that 75% of steam users have, nvidia. Because the 1% lows there are so bad compared to Windows and nvidia doesn't give a shit to fix the problem they've known about for over a year now.",Negative
AMD,"You can't use it on Windows at all, so your performance there is 0% and forever will be, while these cards will be usable on Linux for a long time still.  It's amazing such old cards are even being worked on on Linux. New AMD cards don't have any performance gaps in fact Linux graphics stack is way higher quality than Windows one since not only AMD is working on it.",Positive
AMD,"> I'd rather not play a game than let it touch my kernel level.  Unfortunately, as someone who's played league for 15 years, that really isnt an option. I took a 5 year break, checked it out again last year and now i play regularly again. Not as much as i used to, i play a few games a day now as opposed to like 5-6 fron S1 to S9, so roughly half the playtime, but i have easily over 10k hrs in this game, likely closer to 15k. And i play ranked only, so since im not a casual i cant just ditch the game like that. Over the 5 yrs i played many other competitive games, i played cs go, fortnite, wow, rocket league, but none of em could scratch the itch. After coming back to league, i realized what i was missing. I was missing league. Theres just no other game out there that feels this good to play. Especially since im very good at it (I was Master in S8 which is like GM now due to inflation and cuz GM didnt exist back then). Turns out, being REALLY good at a game makes it 10x more fun when u're playing it competitively, who would have thought! Ofc, im not gonna be a pro player or anything like that, but it doesnt mean i cant feel satisfaction from my 3 ranked games a day and feel the pleasure of improving and watching my rank grow. None of the other games i played felt anywhere near as good. In cs go i got master guardian but thats kinda mid. In rocket league i saw the dudes flying and i was like, nah no way i can learn that without another 10k hours investment, same for dota. Fortnite no build was cool, i employed the hide in a cellar afk strategy and was able to reach Unreal, the highest rank, averaging 0.11 kills per game. I quit cuz it was boring and after watching pros like Prospering i realized this guy can do 40 kill games, aint no way i will ever be as good as him at this game. Wow was cool and i nearly got the 0.1% title in m+, fell barely short, was doin 14s and 15s as a tank. However, these 3 months were miserable, everything was a chore, its like u gotta wash the dishes and clean the toilet in a video game, dailies weeklies rep farm, alt chars grinding, raids and vault slots to rng the bis trinkets etc. And in the end it didnt even feel that good, honestly wow is such a slow paced game its kinda boring. And yeah, i realized there doesnt exist another game like league that makes me happy. That, and nvidia drivers being complete poop means linux is not an option at all for me, and most other competitive gamers out there.",Negative
AMD,"The problem is that it does exist in current reality, and I can't play with my friends unless I use windows.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah it does, otherwise ur games will be full of cheaters, as opposed to one occasionally here or there.",Neutral
AMD,yup unfortunately i still have a dual boot system with windows so i can play counterstrike on faceit (with their anticheat) its the only reason i still have windows on my PC honestly.... like there is literally no other reason to have windows now.,Negative
AMD,"Sorry to break it to u but EAC is worthless as an anticheat. The only anticheat that successfully defeats external DMA devices is Vanguard, because it runs since boot and is incredibly strict, requiring strict security features in ur bios to be on and working. Ive successfully cheated in eac games many times just to test how easy it is, and oh boy, is it easy, as long as u got money to pay. Ofc, u do get banned eventually, but in the short term EAC doesnt stop u from even INJECTING into the game in some cases (like dead by deadlight), it is actually so bad lol. Vanguard is the only good anticheat on the planet.",Negative

AMD,That's fine. Perhaps Linux isn't for you. Allowing additional third party software access to the kernel level is a security risk. It's silly to introduce such risks due to a couple of gaming companies demanding it for the sole purpose of anti-cheat.,Negative
AMD,"I have a strict rule: Never judge other people's game choices, respect everyone's right to play what they want and spend their time on the activities that make them happy...  ... it's a very strict rule that I will still **absolutely** break when it comes to the gross cesspool that is LoL.

AMD,"I think league is not different than the other games like Marvel Rivals. U feel amazing when u win (dopamine rush), and u feel terrible when u lose. Altho, in league it feels extra miserable. Like in cs or rivals, u can be 1v3 and u might just clutch it, even with a deagle u can get some good headshots and win the round. But in league, if ur teammates were feeding, well now that 1v3 is the enemies also having 2 items on top of u, meaning they are like a tank and u're like a kitten to them, making it impossible to win. So u lose and ur whole game experience is getting trashed around because someone else fed the enemies. Even when i came back to league and i initially didnt care about my rank cuz i was just relearning the game after 5 yrs of not playing, it felt sooo miserable to lose. I didnt care about my LP at all cuz i knew i was rusty as fuck, and it still felt so bad to lose cuz the entire experience that u spend there feels like u're locked in like a hostage or smth. And yeah i main jungle and get told to kill myself and flamed every game (with creative ways like talon E off a building cuz the chat punishments are unreal in 2025), but ive grown such thick skin over the years that it doesnt bother me at all anymore, but yeah definitely the most toxic of all the mainstream games, except maybe for dbd, tho in the last few yrs bhvr introduced anti camping and anti tunneling mechanics so its not that bad. But yeah asides from that league is really not as bad as people make it seem to be, my only big complaint is that people dont surrender early enough. Im in diamond so unlike low elo they do surrender a lot, but still not quite as much as they should, but i also mainly play late game scaling champs so it doesnt bother me as much cuz my teammates wanna keep me hostage by not surrendering (cuz they still think we can win, somehow) then good for me cuz if any1s gonna carry its gonna be me on my monster scaling champ, tho realistically once ure far behind its prob like 10% chance to win, not worth dragging a 20 min game out for another 10 mins to slowly suffocate to death. Enemies in diamond are good at ending games but not amazing like master+ are, so they generally manage to end but it takes a bit more time which makes it more frustrating cuz like they have a 12k gold lead, mess around a lil bit, give u 4k gold back but they still have 8k lead and and 3 drakes so they end anyway with baron/soul at like 30 mins. Basically the enemies throw just enough to give 2 of ur 4 teammates enough hope to press No in the surrender vote, but not enough to actually come back (usually). But yeah i wouldnt say league is a bad game, it teaches u patience and perseverence ESPECIALLY if u main jungle cuz every1 always blames u all the time. U learn quickly whose opinion and words to ignore and how to read people's emotional wellbeing. The jungler is the leader of the team and he's the one who makes the calls on the map, like calling ur support to roam to voidgrubs, telling ur mid laner to push and recall 30 secs before the spawn timer so he can arrive full hp to the fight and so on. If u play mechanically easy champs (so not leesin or nidalee) u can carry pretty much exclusively by using ur brain even if u dont have great hands (aka mechanics), u cant really do that in most other games, like i was great with nades and setups in cs go but my aim sucks so much i always lose a 1v1 fight even in gold, honestly amazing i got to master guardian like that. So yeah, u should try league too, it can be fun if u know how to play around the game's strengths and weaknesses.",Negative

AMD,Been working perfectly fine in Win11 ever since I moved on from 10.,Positive
AMD,"Dotes is part of what you said about liking league but even more. On the simpler heroes, the game is even more macro focused with less mechanics due to the lack of skillshots and not needing to master kiting due to turnrate. Dota also has more dynamic itemisation and heroes are genuinely alot more flexible and less pigeon-holed into a playstyle.   If you don't care too much about mechanical skill like you said, dota has so many ways to strategise and outsmart with mechanics like smoke, the waygate and the insane abilities of some heroes allowing for crazy maneuvers like underlord ult being able to create a portal. No ff button is the main downer compared to league. I get why you dropped it though because you said you enjoyed league 10× more because you were good at it, whereas you would have to grind to get good in dota, which is thousands of hours.",Neutral

Which is what I'm talking about. Unless you can show a source that they still support it and provide drivers?,Negative
AMD,"Yeah exactly, its not that dota 2 is a bad game, i just realized it would take forever to be even half decent at it. In my 20 hrs playing i also noticed theres no role selector when u queue (i dont wanna play roles i dont like) and most importantly, there is no jungle role. I mean i could go jungle but id prob be flamed from the get go by the top laner (pos x, i forgot the number) since hed be 1v2, and from what i read jungling in dota 2 isnt even good at high level. I remember the patch, smth like 7.34? Or 7.14? Basically right after they nerfed that medusa character, they nerfed her ability so she cant jungle well. Its like every time a hero is good in the jungle at high level valve nerfs him so u have to play 2v2 in the top lane (or was it bot lane). Anyway, im too far down the rabit hole with league and i like playing it cuz i feel like i have a lot of impact as a jungler, it is by far the most impactful role in soloq so very often when i lose a game i know its my fault cuz i didnt play better or cuz i fucked up. Like yeah top can go 0/5 but if i had ganked bot better they would be 5/0 and it would all equal out, but maybe my pathing was bad or my gank timing was a bit off so we didnt get kills bot and then they had a fed top and we had fuck all. Also instant queue times and if u queue as jungle/mid u always get jungle. Plus as the jungler being the leader od the team, most people listen to u. Some dont but if they dont listen to u, they certainly wouldnt if u were playing any other role either.",Negative

I don’t think any AM4 x3D silicon has rolled off the assembly line since last September.   Maybe they could do a Rocket Lake style back port and get a newer Zen running on AM4.

AMD,That will help only those who already are on AM4 and want to upgrade CPU and already own DDR4 ram. But prices of DDR4 have already been increasing in fast pace and are already almost 300% what they have been just in October here in Norway and I believe similar situation is in other places too. Anyone who thought that stable DDR 4 prices will stay down or not get extremely expensive just wait. Everyone is now trying to make money on desperate PC people. Look just the prices of standard HDD. Everyone who thought of going over from SSDs or M.2 to HDD for mass storage should know HDD prices are also going up in incredible pace. Yeah PC users are FUCKED big time.,Neutral
AMD,"I have had this same thought the last few days after seeing X3D prices skyrocket. There is obviously demand, but is it worth it enough for them to restart production, even if they have the capability. Not to mention the risk of said chip instantly selling out if the batch is too small.

AMD,Best purchase I ever made back in 2023,Positive
AMD,"YES PLEASE. I’d upgrade in a heartbeat. Hell, try and revive that 5950X3D",Positive
AMD,My 3600 will have to truck on until well into AM6 probably 🫠,Neutral
AMD,The GOAT,Neutral
AMD,"I am kicking myself for not picking one up when they were readily available.   Would be the biggest boon for my rig, going from a 5600x to a 5800x3d",Positive
AMD,Here I am still rocking my amd 3950x happy as a clam with no plans to upgrade any time soon!,Positive
AMD,I remember knocking this chip when it came out because it wasn’t unlocked for overclocking and now I look like a doofus,Neutral
AMD,Sad day when tech enthusiasts ask for almost obsolete tech due to current tech prices.,Negative
AMD,"Best CPU I've ever purchased by far. Paid 300, 3 years ago and there's still nothing it struggles with, not even a bit.",Positive
AMD,Would the effort to improve upon the Zen 3 chips (Zen 3+/Zen 4) be worth it over simply restarting the production of already existing designs like the 5800X3D? Or using a more advanced node like 6nm or 5nm?,Neutral
AMD,Yep would really like to buy one atm.,Positive
AMD,Got 5700x3d this year and it’s awesome. It’s essentially same speed as modern CPUs gaming at 4k,Positive
AMD,Was thinking of am5. But with all these BS. Ill rather stay am4 and get a 5800x3d,Neutral
AMD,"I upgraded from a 3600 to a 5800X3D that I got on sale, best upgrade ever. I then upgraded to the 9070XT, which I got for $30 over MSRP, so I will be skipping AM5 altogether, especially now since RAM pricing went insane. Fuck..., maybe I will die using this setup if the tech bros just keep fucking over consumers.",Positive
AMD,I fully expect the RAM market to return to normalcy by August,Neutral
AMD,"Very happy to have grabbed my 5700X3D when I did, upgraded my GPU to 5070Ti shortly after. Yesterday my APC Smart-UPS made a very loud pop sound and threw up an error code as my system immediately went dark. Smelling burning I scrambled for a power bar and all I could do was pray my computer didn't get fried because hitting PC Part Picker is NOT very fun these days!",Positive
AMD,Please just 5850X3d or maybe 5955X3d for us. I will even buy it original price,Neutral
AMD,5950x3d would be fucking sick,Negative
AMD,*revive ddr4,Neutral
AMD,Hail the king baby.,Neutral
AMD,I'd buy two for my kids.,Positive
AMD,I had to settle for the 5700x3d…. I actually swapped from a 5800x because I mostly do 90% gaming 10% everything else /sad,Negative
AMD,I would absolutely get one. I'd give my kid the 5600x3d,Positive
AMD,"I would get one. And if there are bundle deals with an AM4 mobo, I would too. Not that my current mobo can't handle it but I broke the USB 3.0 header on it and I can't use the front panel USB ports on my case. Stupid reason I know but well.",Neutral
AMD,"5800X3D the GOAT, right after it is 5700X3D",Neutral
AMD,My old 5800xed and my old R7 make a good steam machine.  In a small ITX box.,Positive
AMD,"I actually upgraded at the beginning of the year, from a 3700x to the 5800x3d, 16 to 32gb at around 65€ and got the 9070xt, don't regret it at all seeing what again happened, next step will be a monitor upgrade :)",Neutral
AMD,"I have a 5900X, I would ‘downgrade’ my cpu to one of these and move my current chip to my server (currently an i5 6500)",Neutral
AMD,Or make somehow make the new processors/mbs work with DDR4 lol. That's the only way I'd upgrade. I'm not an engineer so I'm not sure if that's even possible.,Neutral
AMD,5**9**00X3D.  Dr. Su literally had one in her hands when she unveiled 3D V-Cache,Neutral
AMD,OMG please!,Neutral
AMD,seems gamers are not paying attention to market forces   AI makes more money to sell to,Negative
AMD,Looks like we're going the distance buddy.,Neutral
AMD,But I just got a 5700x...,Neutral
AMD,"went from 3700x to 5800x3D 2 years ago, best investment ever  I am planning to keep this and skip AM5+DDR5 going directly to AM6+DDR6 :P",Positive
AMD,5700x3d would be cheaper for 10% less perf max. But yeah the idea is good!,Positive
AMD,I'd love to see a 5900X3D or 5950X3D.,Positive
AMD,"Release a 5950X3D with 3D cache on both dies, and I'd buy it.",Positive
AMD,Be careful what you ask for. Seems like a perfect opportunity for AMD to come out scalping with it costing $600 or more.,Neutral
AMD,"Rocking 5800x non 3D, i won't replace it anytime took tbh",Neutral
AMD,"I just sold a 5800x3D for more than I bought it 3 years ago, which was also more than it cost me for the 9800x3D lol",Neutral
AMD,I bought a 5700x3d off aliexpress years ago for $120. Feelsgoodman,Positive
AMD,On paper it sounds like a good idea for them to spend some time backporting new archs to AM4 if this memory shortage will last a while. But I still doubt they have enough time to do that if they were to start today.,Neutral
AMD,"I regret not getting a 5800 or 5700x3d because I thought I’d have enough saved up to do a whole mobo, RAM, and CPU upgrade for my rig.  Waited too long then the RAM shortage hit and now I’m stuck with my 3700x for the next few years.",Negative
AMD,"I upgraded mine a while back, keeping it until AM6 at least",Neutral
AMD,"Been trying to find one, but $400+ for a used, 5 year old CPU from a random source on eBay is just a terrible deal. Fuck this bullshit.",Negative
AMD,"I don't see this happening, because the current memory shortages will not be fixed by switching back to DDR4. DDR4 production will be ending very soon and memory manufacturers will be more than happy to shift all production to DDR5.   The current memory shortage problem is a result of an artificial surge in demand while manufacturers remain cautious about ramping up production too hard, lest the bubble bursts and they have to drop prices through the floor. It's going to be a while before either side gives in.",Negative
AMD,"I would love that. By the time I got my savings in a better state, I only found a store selling the last of the stock at premium price. And switching to AM5 is too expensive for my taste. So yeah, it would get in line to buy one.",Positive
AMD,No 5800x better more ram performance gain if the produce them with higher quality they could all run 5ghz allcore and 2x16gb 4000 1:1 mode,Positive
AMD,"AM4 changed the game but none of us has predicted for how long yet! Went with a full custom watercooled AM4 platform since 2017 on 8xcores CPUs on a Crosshair VI Extreme paired with a GTX1080Ti and a 2x8GB kit of B-Die DDR4 (@3800C16currently)  : 1700X 4.1GHz / 2700X 4.2Ghz / 3800X 4.3 Ghz / 5800X3D Undervolted 4.45 Ghz... And with the addition of an RTX3080Ti recently, that 7 years-old AM4 platform feels like it's gonna keep taking it for years to come like a champ!",Positive
AMD,I hope they make more 5800x3d. They stopped by choice.,Neutral
AMD,Where can I get one nowdays? Seems sold out everywhere.,Positive
AMD,"Yes please!!... Currently I'm still rocking a 5800x3d and have 2 other AM4 pc's waiting for an upgrade. At that time the original 5800x3d had a restriction on clocks and temps due to the 3d v-cache being on top... With the current 9800x3d using the v-cache at the bottom to take advantage of better coolers and temps, I would definitely buy at least 2 more and know some partners that would make the final upgrade for their long forgotten AM4 still rocking ryzen 3000 cpu's.",Positive
AMD,"5800x3d is starting to show it's age, but I'll run it till AM6 I reckon. Same with my 7900XTX. CPU bound on BF6 is kinda annoying. 5800x3d can't really deliver more than 120-130FPS in BF6, and makes me CPU bound which is annoying.",Negative
AMD,"5700x3D (on my Ryzen 1 cheap motherboard) and RX 9070, I'm ready for the years to come.",Positive
AMD,Which gamers and which reviewers exactly? 🤔,Neutral
AMD,yes please,Neutral
AMD,Releasing 5850X3D (with the compute die on top of 3D cache just like 9800X3D) would be better.,Neutral
AMD,One of the best buys ever for me,Positive
AMD,It's definitely the 1080 Ti of CPUs.,Neutral
AMD,300 well spend bucks 3 years ago...,Neutral
AMD,Yeah Id be willing to pay a pretty penny if they would be willing to sell it for a slight mark up.,Neutral
AMD,"Same, i'm skipping AM5 all together",Neutral
AMD,"Bring back the 5800X3D, please!",Neutral
AMD,"Made the jump from 1800x to 5800x3d, was incredible. Not sure how much the older x370 motherboard chipset is a limiter at this point.",Neutral
AMD,Picked up a brand new 5800X3d for $280.00 two years ago and sold my 5800X for $160.  Social media haters said it was a side grade and not an upgrade.  Look who is laughing now.  Ha ha ha.  My 5800X3d paired with my rtx 5070 ti is playing everything on Ultra and high with no bottlenecking.  Will probably be still doing the same for the next 3 years.  And I was also able to pick up 64Gb of G.Skill tridentZ (4X16) 16 18 18 39 for $124 in June this year.  So happy I purchased before this rampocalypse,Positive
AMD,"If they would now come with a 5850x3d with slightly higher clocks, everyone and their mom would buy it.  Companies often underestimate the demand for the ""last best option"" on last gen platforms that are still being used.",Neutral
AMD,Bummed to not have got one of these. My 5600x is fine but I know I’m missing out,Negative
AMD,"Yes! I really hope they do! I'd buy a 5800x3D immediately!   I started to upgrade my AM4 system with the goal of transitioning over to an AM5 build, but the RAM issue has me holding off on things.   I currently am running a 5600x, 32GB RAM(3600), 2x 2TB NVMe, and a 5070ti on a 27"" curved 1440p Asus monitor.   The 5070ti was an upgrade from the 3060ti I was running. And I upgraded to a Corsair 850w psu at the same time.   All I need to complete the new build is a mobo,cpu,and RAM. Possibly a new cpu cooler.   But, if I could get a 5800x3D for a good price, I'd probably buy that and stick with AM4 for awhile longer.",Positive
AMD,Upgraded my R5 3600 to R7 5800X3D like a year ago. Best decision ever. Think i can survive 3-4 more years with it.,Positive
AMD,"Yeah, I won't be changing mine out any time soon.",Neutral
AMD,I got that cpu 3 days ago. Decided to upgrade laterally and keep ddr4. It's really a good cpu.,Positive
AMD,Intel is looking pretty good these days if you're on a budget and want to do ddr4.  I just grabbed a 14600k for my dad's build for only $210 CAD and a 32gb kit of ddr4 was only $200 CAD.I would've built him an AM5 system for sure if DDR5 prices weren't insane.,Positive
AMD,I feel dumb but why exactly? Seems like linked to ram price but ddr4 is also getting more expensive is it?,Negative
AMD,"Hopefully amd bean counters are looking in to it...  If they figure revenue is greater than cost then they would go for it.  The big factor there is estimating how big the market is for a 5850x3d or maybe a 6800x3d or something where they find another foundry to kinda make what they had or jank a zen4 into am4.  The likelihood of the same sku would be very low because of these factors.  So how big is the market/potential revenue and is it more than the cost of janking something together.  That market size question falls each day we get closer to the end of the ram shortage.  I gotta think it is at least being kicked around.  Maybe it will die, but it has to be a thought.",Neutral
AMD,"AM4 X3D chips only existed and made sense because they were derived of Milan-X EPYC CPU's, which is no longer in production. AMD isn't going to spin these back up again just for a small amount of consumer demand without the ocean of datacenter demand backing it up..",Neutral
AMD,Make AM4 Great Again,Positive

AMD,Glad I kept it; it was made too good.,Positive
AMD,"Upgraded my 3600X to 5800X3D kind of on a ($600) whim. I didn't really have any good reason to. I guess my logic at the time was to get the 'last, and best version' of AM4 and ride out this build. Other than paying full price for it, I've been happy with it. Can't say the same about the buggy Radeon driver experience however.",Neutral
AMD,"I've had my 5800X3D for just over 3 years now. It's going to my wife and I'm upgrading to a 9800X3D. I bought 64gb of DDR5-6000 for $500 CDN less than it is today. Still more than at its lowest, but I knew I had to pull the trigger while I had the money.  Edit: Canadian dollars not US dollars",Neutral
AMD,I sold my used 5800X3D a few weeks ago for more than what I paid for my 9800X3D 😅,Neutral
AMD,"Well, instead of reviving the 5800X3D, isn't it just easier to make a DDR4 AM5 motherboard?",Neutral
AMD,Ditto.,Neutral
AMD,I will rock it forever  if they bring it back,Neutral
AMD,"Mine died under warranty, after waiting 6 months for a replacement I gave up and had to settle with a 5700x. Pretty sad and annoyed by it as this was my plan too.",Negative
AMD,Same. Still going strong.,Neutral
AMD,Plan to rock mine until it can no longer play MMO FFXIV. I'll leave to the Japanese to support the game on a GTX 970.,Neutral
AMD,5700x3d til ATLEAST Second gen AM6.,Neutral
AMD,"Yep, not gonna start considering an upgrade until long enough into AM6 to not be an early adopter.",Neutral
AMD,Same here. Getting in on the end of AM5 isn’t anywhere as appealing as the start of AM6. My next motherboard is gonna get a long time of use…,Negative
AMD,Same brother !,Neutral
AMD,Same!,Neutral
AMD,Yeppers,Neutral
AMD,When is AM6 expected?,Neutral
AMD,"I was thinking about getting a 9800x3d at some point but it's just not even worth it. At this point I have a 9070xt, 5800x3d, and 32gb of 3600 ddr4 ram. I mainly game at 4k, so I'll rock the 5800x3d for a while and just upgrade my GPU in like 2-3 years.",Negative
AMD,"I have a 5700x3d, 32 GB DDR4 4000, a 2 TB SSD, and a 4080 Super.  I’m well situated to outlast the AI boom, figure I should be able to get playable framerates on new games for the next 5 years.",Positive
AMD,Rocking mine til AM7,Neutral
AMD,The chip makers are making so much money off of AI that they don't even want to serve the consumer market at all anymore because the margins are lower.,Negative
AMD,"Bought a 5700X3D for $120 USD brand new and sold my 3700x for $75. Such a solid upgrade. Paired with my 5080, I should get another few years on my system.",Positive
AMD,Likewise mate! Also switched out the 3700x for the 5800x3d. Also switched a 2080s out for the. 6800XT at the time.   The 9070XT has been cheaper here as compared to what I paid for the 6800xt. Still can't decide if it's worth it now or worth waiting it all out,Neutral
AMD,"Same!  I got it in a discount bundle from microcenter.  Like 350 for the chip, a new mobo and 32 gigs of ram.  Crazy amazing deal",Positive
AMD,"I don't even blame the RAM manufacturers **this** time.   I think the RAM manufacturers know AI is a bubble. It takes multiple years to build new manufacturing plants to expand production. Meanwhile, the AI bubble could pop in like 6 months.  I blame Sam Altman buying up all the RAM.",Negative
AMD,"I rotationally upgraded my current PC from the 1800x on a 370 platform, up to a 3800x & finally a 5800X 3D & 570, glad I got 32GB of RAM when I did, because the G.Skill modules and latency haven't been available for quite a long while.",Positive
AMD,Same. Got my 5800x3D when rumors were that it was a very limited run so paid £337 in January 2023. It’s nearly 3 years old and it’s been a beast. Was an upgrade from a 3600,Positive
AMD,"Likewise, still feel no need to upgrade from it.",Neutral
AMD,I made the same upgrade last year. Amazing performance along with a 4070 Ti.,Positive
AMD,">got my 5800x3d years ago best purchase ever. I was ever so hesitant from coming from the 3700x cpu but the magic that was 3d cache can not be underestimated.  I made the same upgrade and I totally concur, going from a 3700X to a 5800X3D definitely felt like a bigger upgrade than going from an i5 4670k to a 3700X.  >now if we can just get a big amd gpu i wouldn't have to worry for a while.  As far as I'm concerned my 6900XT still delivers on 1440p on most games, but 16GB of VRAM is beginning to feel a little cramped for the newer games.",Positive
AMD,Exact same 3700x -> 5800x3d for me,Neutral
AMD,How much is the difference now ? And what gpu you have?,Neutral
AMD,"If anything prices on CPUs will drop thanks to lower sales due to increased memory prices, people will keep from updating for a while.  DDR4 production has been completely shut down since 6 months so AM4 parts availability will drop anyway and production plans has already been phased down in favor of other platforms.",Negative
AMD,"Switched to the x3d while using a 3700x as well. 330 at microcenter on the first black friday after its release and I was floored at how much more performance I got. Double the fps in wow was completely unexpected, spikes in fortnite were nowhere to be found.",Positive
AMD,Why would ram manufacturers scale for artificial demand tied to an industry everyone knows is a bubble,Negative
AMD,"We just need to wait for the fabs to catchup on production and eventually there will be some available for consumers and bring prices back to more reasonable levels. This ai bubble popping will just hurt gamers and consumers because it's basically fueling future technology development and advancement. If we hold through the expensive price hikes, we'll benefit from rapid growth in the end.",Neutral
AMD,"I kinda regret my purchase of the 5800X3D. The 5700X3D got announced within literal weeks for hundreds of $ less for like \~3-5% less performance. Couldn't even return it as I was not in the country at the time, and by the time I came back I was well beyond the return window.",Negative
AMD,Also went from 3700X to 5800x3d early on. The difference was significant even with a 1080Ti at 1440p.  Eventually I swapped it for a 6800XT and now an 9070XT since release. Works great.,Positive
AMD,"Managed to buy a new 5700x3d , the last one , few months ago.",Neutral
AMD,it's sadly not going to. It's going to pop in all of our faces,Negative
AMD,"It takes time to scale up, guaranteed they're already in the process of doing so",Neutral
AMD,The scarcity isn’t artificial at all.  The memory makers found buyers willing to spend far more than those that make consumer memory.,Neutral
AMD,"> I don’t think any AM4 x3D silicon has rolled off the assembly line since last September.  SKUs haven't, but AMD extended Milan availability to 2026, which means the silicon is there.",Neutral
AMD,"The beauty of it is they wouldn't need to do a Rocketlake style backport, just put newer chiplets alongside the older IO die on the package.",Neutral
AMD,Almost definitely easier to release an AM5 motherboard that supports DDR4 than a newer Zen on AM4.,Positive
AMD,"Bartlett Lake is allegedly for the embedded market only, no?",Neutral
AMD,"Even if next years market is catastrophic, I just dont see how spinning up an entirely new hybrid SKU (So eg Zen 4 or 5 but with DDR4 Support) would make any economical sense when looking at the cost and also the fact theyre already 2 Gens in on AM5.",Negative
AMD,"I'm up to 4 AM4 machines in my house now.   3600x, 3700x, 3900x, and my 5800x3d.  I'll be running AM4 for probably the next 10 years until I retire the last of them   Edit:  also have a laptop with a 5600h, but that's not Am4",Neutral
AMD,"Oh man, I fucking wish. I’d be all over it.",Positive
AMD,THIS!!!  I really enjoy my 5950x but it could use a little more oomph in the gaming department.,Neutral
AMD,Pfft just have them make a 5950X3DX edition with a 32GB HBM MALL cache with DDR4.     Problem solved!,Neutral
AMD,"It was in the labs, Lisa Su even showed a prototype at Computex 2021 lol.",Neutral
AMD,"They actually did...but it was just an engineering sample that never made it to market 😞. They maxed it out with 3DV-cache for each CCD, too.  https://youtu.be/RTA3Ls-WAcw?si=\_6NcQQG798fTH8aR&t=1072]  How awesome would that be tho, if they finally crowned the AM4 platform with a 5950X3D (with the cache on both CCDs, flipped in the right position this time for higher clocks, and windows cache optimizer chipset drivers).  Do it AMD!!!",Neutral
AMD,Yes  And maybe give us 2 x3d dies,Neutral
AMD,If they did that it might straight up cannibalize themselves for how too good it would be,Positive
AMD,I’ve been waiting for this since X3D has been a thing.  I will unironically pay $400 or more for that chip so I don’t have to upgrade my entire PC when my 5900X is no longer cutting it. Getting an extra 3 years or so would be worth it.,Positive
AMD,Gimmi.,Neutral
AMD,Or bring back dual CPU motherboards to the DIY market,Neutral
AMD,"Did you check the new 9950x3d-2?... It has v-cache over each CCD, instead of only one of them... A 5950x3d-2 would be the ultimate and final upgrade for an AM4 setup... I will definitely do the jump to AM5 when RAM prices get closer to normal next year and with ryzen 10000 jump in performance.",Positive
AMD,They don't make them anymore and they're one of the best DDR4 cpu's available. I bought a 5700x3d at the beginning of the year and it had already risen to $250. I imagine it's higher than that now.,Positive
AMD,Man i would sell my 5800x3d now if it's fucking $400 so I can upgrade but ram prices are ridiculous. Maybe I'll wait til AM7 now looking at hardware prices... Was previously gonna do AM6 upgrade.,Negative

AMD,"> stay affordable  lmao, even bottom of the barrel ddr4 is like triple the price it was a few months ago.",Negative
AMD,Got a 5700x3d on cyber Monday from AliExpress and they’ve shot up since. Can’t wait to slot it in to replace my 2600. My 1080ti will be happy,Positive
AMD,AM4 Boards a true troopers.,Neutral
AMD,"The reason the 5700x3d released so late, compared to the 5800x3d, is that it's just 5800x3ds that didn't make the cut in clockspeed.  I got one towards the end of last year for a great price, and the performance difference is usually a little bit more than 2%, but it was literally less than half the cost of a 5800x3d.",Neutral
AMD,Same as me. I bought 128GB RAM but two of the sticks stopped working. 64 is enough though.,Negative
AMD,Thankful about being two generations behind?,Neutral
AMD,They will or they will starve for sales and their Mobo partners will as well.,Neutral
AMD,I noticed a difference going from a 5600x to 5800x3d. Mostly in the 1% lows.,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, if you can find it for a reasonable price. I went from a 5600x to a 5700x3d and it was worth it to me, but I paid like $130 on AliExpress a bit over a year ago.",Positive
AMD,Unless you're playing cpu bound games it's probably not worth it. If you can get it for cheap then sure.,Negative
AMD,DDR4 production is over. This product would only be for people already on the AM4 platform.,Negative
AMD,"The AM5 Chips only have ram controllers for DDR5. You could make a motherboard with DDR4 slots but I seriously doubt it would work. Before, the ram controller was on the motherboard but now it's inside the CPU itself so we'd just be back to square one",Negative
AMD,"Not going to happen, Zen 3 X3D Production ceased like a Year ago and every x3d product based on Zen3 sold are just downbinned 5800X3Ds that failed QA Testing. Even if they now decided to buy both 7nm production capacity and Front side Hybrid Bonding it would take at least a year until you would be able to buy new 5800X3Ds, and all of which would be pretty expensive for what to them is a last last gen niche product. I mean yeah it would be pretty nice but economically this wouldnt make any sense even if they tried to be nice.",Negative
AMD,How’d it die?,Neutral
AMD,If this happens to me I'll probably just sell the rest of my PC at this point lol,Negative
AMD,I just got my hands on GTX 970 to replace 660Ti on my second scrap PC and it's surprisingly capable card running Valheim at 1080p max settings,Positive
AMD,"Same here, upgraded my 5600x to a 5700x3D before they became expensive AF. Upgraded my 6800 to a 9070XT a few weeks ago, initially wanted to do a full upgrade somewhere in early '26, but at the moment I can play everything on ultra with 150+ and beyond fps on 1440p, so I'm good for at least 3-4 years, I reckon.",Neutral
AMD,"Same, with my 5700x3D and 4070 Super, I think I’m good for some years",Positive
AMD,"I bought in 2020, at what I thought was the end of AM4–but I had the money (and time, lol) to upgrade. I got a 5600x figuring maybe down the road I could get a 5900x or 5950x if I wanted something faster. Instead, I got a 5700x3D cheap last year which has been a nice upgrade!  I’m hoping AM6 has more cores per CCD, I’ll probably start with an x600 and then upgrade to x3d on the 2nd or 3rd gen.",Positive
AMD,Not anytime soon. 28 or 29 or something .,Neutral
AMD,It would use fabs that aren't currently being used to make AI chips (for the most part I would assume) so it would be more additional revenue than one eating into the other.,Neutral
AMD,greedy bas\*\*\*\*s. But nothing new,Negative
AMD,"For AMD their AI gross margins are actually below their corporate average. Meanwhile, gaming CPUs for AMD have always been above their corporate average margin.   There's also nothing that stops AMD from doing this. There's no conflict of wafer supply or other packaging shortages that overlap with AI. The hardest part might just be trying to start back up those old packaging lines and old wafer starts. It could be pretty difficult to do it. And as soon as they could have any products out would be in 6 months which would probably still be worth it. But who knows.",Neutral
AMD,yeah i came off a 5600x for a 5700x3d and paired with a 9070xt its really a solid combo. I got so lucky doing a minor refresh on my pc earlier this year.,Positive
AMD,"I swapped my 2700x for 5700X3D and Vega 56 for RX 6800 XT, works wonders :3",Positive

This was done primarily to test the Zen 4 compute dies (CCDs) and architecture using the existing, mature AM4 infrastructure before the AM5 platform was fully ready. * **The ""Hybrid"" Design:** To make this work, engineers likely paired the **Zen 4 CCDs** (5nm) with a compatible **Zen 3-era I/O die** (12nm) that supported DDR4 memory and the AM4 socket. * **Decision to Cancel:** Despite having functional 16-core Zen 4 samples on AM4, AMD chose not to bring them to market. They instead focused on the  **Ryzen 7 5800X3D**  as the final high-performance gaming upgrade for the AM4 platform because the 3D V-Cache provided a more significant gaming benefit on the older socket than a core-count increase."" * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM1NXHQ8YTA&t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM1NXHQ8YTA&t=2s)",Neutral

AMD,"No it isn't. TSMC 7nm afaik is an entirely new node and not a refresh thus it will need a redesign instead of just use the same design that they use for 10nm.  Also you typically don't use 7nm or lower for RAM since there is a lot less benefit vs making it on the bigger nodes. Basically RAM doesn't scale as well as logic (the density improvement for making RAM on smaller node is not great) thus why you don't see companies making DRAM on 7nm.  So when if someone want to make RAM on 7nm, they need to design it first and do all of the testing and validation process and then potentially have a product that is a lot more expensive. I will say that with the current price and assuming this kind of pricing last long, it might be viable (as in not losing money) to sell RAM that is made in 7nm process but still doing that would only add very little available RAM to the pool and the product itself is not going to be better.",Negative

It does not need to be ""completely"" redesigned, but repurposed and bug stomped. Maybe figure out the meaning of the words you are using?  You also did not bother addressing the fact in my original statement that there is nothing to cannibalize if people cannot afford Ram for it. ""If it is too expensive to upgrade AMD will starve...""  The people with money that can afford the expensive DDR5 setups will benefit from those and the performance they offer while the potential customers will be able to afford AM4 setups that cannibalize old DDR4 builds. Think Ryzen 1000 series, Ryzen 2000 series and Ryzen 3000 and even Ryzen 5000 series that wanted upgrades but were waiting for a little longer and now cannot afford them because of DDR5 shooting up over 300%. Well they cannot afford to upgrade anymore, but they want to. This would give them a reasonable path. Think of the $100 steak vs the $500 cheeseburger. The $100 steak is reasonable and logical  when compared to the $500 cheeseburger.  It also builds customer loyalty and customer good will.

AMD,The only reason CUDA gained such prominence was because Nvidia literally ran programs giving away free GPUs to colleges and universities to get people familiar with the software and write extensive libraries for it for many use cases. The whole CUDA ecosystem relies on the work the regular Devs have done. Something similar to what AMD is doing now. You think this program is just to fix some bugs? It's to get people to actually use Rocm and learn it as well. The laptops are an incentive.  CUDA like you say has been around for 2 decades.

AMD,That's a stupid question. You do it so you aren't dependent on one company with a black box technology.  ROCm is open source. It's got far more potential because it's customizable beyond CUDA.

AMD,"If it is just for video output: all AM5 CPUs have an integrated GPU that can drive 4k60 no problem (not in 3D, but 2D stuff like video playback is no problem at all). Only those with a 'F' suffix have the GPU disabled.  I.e. a Ryzen 5 7400 goes for 130€ (tax included, so about 120 USD without tax), which is more than enough for video playback. For 140€ you can get a Ryzen 5 8500G, which has a little less CPU power (like 5% less) but has a way more powerful integrated GPU. You can play most games on low settings on it, if it is an older game you can probably max it out no problem. It is about on par with a GTX 1050. So if your home theater should also function as an emulation machine for everything PS2 and older, even some PS3 era games, go for this CPU.  A dedicated GPU wouldn't be cheaper than about 100USD, so there is just no room to sell those if the cheapest CPU+GPU combo goes for 120USD.  Nvidia is still selling the GT 710 for 50USD, but the integrated GPU in the Ryzen CPUs is about 3 times as powerful. The G version is more than 40 times as powerful, just to compare them. They did have the RTX 1650, but you can't get it new anymore, was 160SUD at launch but went up to over 500USD towards the end of its life cycle.

AMD,"I’m glad to see that I’m writing to curious people.   u/SeventyTimes_7    u/Ambitious-Ad8725    u/Sora_hishoku   I’ll simplify the discussion to make it more interesting and less technical/daunting.  CELL was conceptually the father of NVIDIA’s success.   For the first time, the focus was on specialized parallel computing, and the engineers at Sony, IBM, and Toshiba were visionary and extremely bold in pursuing that path.   They only made one mistake: such a CPU couldn’t function properly without adequate software support. That’s where NVIDIA came in and realized it needed to create CUDA for its GPUs, offering what CELL did, but with an easier language and an intuitive framework for programming.   Without CELL, history would have gone differently.   For me, preserving that CPU is like preserving a piece of computing history.  RDNA3, on the other hand, is one of the boldest, most audacious, and futuristic choices in the entire industry. It's the future today, where everything will be chiplet   It shifts towards horizontal development, not just vertical, even in the consumer sector. It allows interconnections between multiple chips with record bandwidths of over 5 terabytes per second, eliminating many bottlenecks that are inevitable with manufacturing nodes and monolithic chips.   This isn’t just a simple play; AMD has managed to overcome the latency barriers that are extremely severe on GPUs, unlike CPUs.  They also redesigned the Compute Units with FP32 SIMD, bringing intelligence inside the chip for the first time, not just size and raw power.   In magazines, you’ll read that the 7900XTX has 6,144 shader units, but that’s a partial figure it depends on the scheduler, the compiler, and how well the code is written.   6,144 represents the minimum, where each instruction is incompatible with another. In real practice, however, code often contains many compatible and similar instructions, so the count can theoretically reach up to 12,288, within reasonable limits.  The key detail is that, for the first time, the chip communicates with software at the lowest level, working in perfect harmony. If the compiler improves in the future, RDNA3 itself improves, because instructions per cycle are reordered and scheduled more efficiently, leveraging far more than the declared 6,144.   Other companies simply increase physical ALUs without addressing modularity and software-driven management.  RDNA3 has an extraordinary pipeline combining general purpose and specialized tasks, modularity in its Compute Units, and many other clever innovations.   Its display engine is phenomenal and still reigns supreme today.   It was a bold and risky choice, but an incredible engineering success.   They could have taken the easy route with a high-wattage monolithic chip, but instead, they pushed the limits physically and mathematically, creating an amazing chip for the consumer market.  It remains a prime example of the validity of the chiplet design, as the first consumer GPU in the world to use a chiplet.   It is capable of leading in performance and efficiency (350W) in theoretical computation following linear math principles.  I want to preserve these two pieces of engineering, as early examples of the future :)",Positive
AMD,"First of all, a gpu with dual bios is recommended in case of inconvenience.  Liquid dissipation is also mandatory as the GPU will have a very high energy consumption by pushing the chip a lot.  After that for the guide I’ll send you a link later",Neutral
AMD,To say such nonsense you don’t know anything about RDNA3.,Negative
AMD,"The xb360's GPU is often slept on in it's position in GPGPU history - it was the first true modern consumer unified shader architecture, and there were a number of GPGPU tools developed for it - lots of games used that for things that *would* have been done on a cell SPE on on the ps3 equivalent. It was a big reason why gamedevs didn't ""miss"" the power of the cell - and it was arguably prescient as GPGPU then became the dominant paradigm for those sort of tasks.  A lot of the stuff developed for that then got rolled into ATI's Close To Metal SDK, which then likely influenced CUDA when that was released later.",Positive

There certainly were no perf/watt or perf benefits like you seem think from that.   And architecturally RDNA 3 was so mid that people were seriously asking if there were issues during the product development.

AMD,"Zen 5 did better in most non gaming tasks,  in Games, we already seen multiple times that wider cores dont really help with gaming performance if you dont increase the cache/get a faster IMC and memory  Rocket lake is another good example, its much beefier than Skylake, but Skylake had lower latencies so the 10900k/10700k outperformed the 11900k/11700k in games  you can also take ""gimped"" Zen 3 APUs that have 16MB of L3 per CCD  and compare them to Zen 2 with 16MB per CCX, the difference is quite small in games     i suspect that Zen 6 with 48MB per CCD (if rumors are true) will do 10 - 15% better than Vanilla Zen 5 in games, but still slower than a 9800x3d  and 10800X3D is where Zen 6 is going to shine  also, if the 7GHz rumors have any truth to them, we might see bigger gains but i doubt 2nm can reach 7ghz",Positive

AMD,AMD has confirmed that it is for AM5,Neutral
AMD,DDR6 isn't coming for years.  Earliest dates you can find are sometime in 2027.  And that is primarily for server use since the cost for it is supposed to be REAL high.  Its probably coming to desktop much later in 2028 or so and Intel will probably launch it first in PC just like they did pretty much DDR2 onwards (IIRC they actually supported RDRAM before DDR).  AMD also tends to delay adopting the latest memory standards by a year or more.  Been that way since before DDR3 came out so they're pretty consistent here.  If they follow that pattern again you won't see AMD requiring DDR6 support until sometime in 2029.  That is why rumors having been coming out that Zen7 will also be on AM5.  Either DDR6 won't be ready in time or AMD won't be ready with a new socket in time for Zen7.  Given the caches they're putting on their chips these days its not like it matters much anyways what RAM they use past a certain point.  You can get more benefit from cranking the IF bus and improving latency then going high bandwidth on AM5 anyways.  And that is for the non-X3D chips.  The X3D chips care even less about main system bandwidth.    Where it would matter is for a high(er) performance iGPU but everyone seems to be going for soldered RAM of some sort with those anyways so its of questionable benefit any which way you look at it for AM5's expected lifespan.,Neutral
AMD,Top-ish end Zen6 could easily be 700USD+.  But its also rumored that 32C/64T is coming Zen6 to very top end so its hard to judge what is really going to happen price + core-wise here.  For reference a 16C/32T Zen5 9950X is about $540 right now though so I'd expect prices to drop a bit lower baring tarrifs or other market BS.,Neutral
AMD,"Depends on the workload.  Games and various other apps are memory bandwidth/latency sensitive with low/maximized ILP (instruction level parallelism) potential due to stalls (waiting for data).  Those are being restricted by the IMC/IOD and fabric interconnection limits.  However, most simple benchmarks happily fit within the core caches and even those showed much lower than expected gains.  Zen 4 has four integer schedulers (96 entries, 24x4), Zen 5 has 1 unified scheduler (88 entries).  There are scenarios where each should have an advantage over the other, but the unified scheduler really should win more often than not... but it seems it wasn't able to maximize the additional execution units as fully as smaller individual schedulers could in Zen 4.  Zen 6 has now, it appears, gone back to individual schedulers, so it seems like an area AMD couldn't make the unified scheduler (which Intel uses) work as well as desired.",Neutral

Because suddenly GPU's and SSD's were able to saturate it and we needed more for our highspeed networking.   Networking is also funny, we had the ability for 400 gigabit for ages. We just didn't need it so it was barely relevant. Same with Gigabit. Man we are JUST barely getting 2.5g devices. But suddenly you can get 400g for under 2k€.   If there is no need for ddr6, then there will not be a ddr6. Some maybe even sidestep ddr for hbm. Not entirely impossible. Just like gddr5 was around a long time, then suddenly we needed more so hbm, dddr6 and gddr6x came around really quickly.",Neutral
AMD,I sincerely hope zen7 lands on am5. I went super budget with my build (7900x for $200) and while it works fine I want to throw an end stage cpu in it from the last support generation when we know for sure that is.,Positive
AMD,"So, $999 for the 32 core cpu.",Neutral
AMD,What sort of rumor is that... They are expanding to 12 core CCDs so I imagine the top would be 24. How do you expect to make up 32 cores with 12core CCDs??? That would mean having 4 CCDs and disabling 4 cores per CCD which I don't see happening... Maybe we'll get 36 cores with 3 CCDs though?,Neutral
AMD,What's the point of this comment lmao,Neutral
AMD,"This is probably true, but believe it’s also the case that they have leapfrogging design teams, e.g Z4 team will have moved onto develop Z6, which might have a bearing on the outcome here.",Neutral
AMD,"yeah thanks, Zen 5 is very good  the ""gaming"" side is just AMD not changing anything in the cache subsystem and IMC being the same  the 48MB L3 on the vanilla Zen 6 is going to be better than Vanilla Zen 5 for sure, if the high clocks rumors turn true, then we might even see really nice gains (unlike wider core, higher clocks have more effect on games)",Positive

AMD,"It's literally not going to matter as AMD can't get fab space/time.  The only way to fix it is to have everything integrated on the processor with HBM, which again, won't happen as AMD can't get fab space/time.  Intel has sadly gone the correct route with their process of integrating the ram into the processor, but it does suck as you can't upgrade it.",Negative

AMD,When have they ever done this with previous x800x3d chips?,Neutral
AMD,"Ehh, you saved like $200 and unless you have a really high end GPU on a relatively low resolution the difference is very minimal, besides in two years or so you can just throw a zen 6 chip in there.",Neutral
AMD,Maybe in games because of the clockspeed increase. but even the any 9000 x3D chip will be marginal of error when it comes to games,Neutral
AMD,"So you're telling me it was the retailers that increased the prices of 7800x3d couple weeks/months before the 9800x3d released? Because that's certainly not what anybody is saying.   9800x3d is most likely not going away or ending production. They'll just increase the price of 9800x3d because well they can.

AMD,"Yeah, that is the price without motherboard bundle.",Neutral
AMD,"It is kinda of how it works when you consider this chip is a perfectly functional 9800X3D that they withheld from the market to apply an unnecessary overclock so they can sell it a higher price. Tho obviously they won't stop production of 9800X3D completely.     They do that all the time tho to their credit this time the overclock is somewhat substantial which is not usual, let's wait and see. Still i think most people would rather this be a normal 9800X3D that they can try overclocking themselves than a pre-overclocked one for 20% higher price, I'm calling it right now this thing will NOT be 20% faster than 9800X3D, probably not even 5%.",Neutral
AMD,The difference comes in cpu heavy titles ofc in non cpu heavy games the difference is margin of error since you aren’t using it,Neutral
AMD,"I agree that it’s money saved. I’m just FOMOing a little bit, plus the whole “well I’ve spent a ton of money on components anyway…”",Neutral
AMD,The 7800x3d went ballistic the second reviews came out to show that they are still a really good CPU choice. Supply and demand did the rest.,Positive
AMD,"AMD didn't increase the MSRP on their store, so yes - it was retailers.",Neutral
AMD,"It's not. There is a Combo deal right now. I got the same thing. 9800X3D, motherboard, and 32GB CL36 DDR for $680",Neutral
AMD,"As a bonus, they're running a special right now that they'll throw in 32GB of DDR5 for $200 with any CPU.  If you need RAM for one of those systems buy it with the CPU, otherwise you're looking at more like $350 for the RAM.",Positive
AMD,As of now it’s not fully even reached 5% lol only 4.7% margin of error likely in most benchmarks. I would assume at most in 1080p and select games they’ll be a 3-5fps improvement maybe. Sometimes it will prolly be the same.,Neutral
AMD,"I was thinking the same thing as you are now, but I gave in. Build a new PC in February with a 9700X and 9070 XT when 9800X3D prices where almost double of the 9700X.   During Black Friday I upgraded to the 9800X3D as it was it was a good price and I couldn't fight my FOMO any longer.   In 1440P I don't think I would notice a difference if you would swap my 9800X3D back to a 9700X. If it makes you happy and you got money to spare go ahead and get the 9800X3D, but the 9700X is still a great CPU. The 1% lows are somewhat better in some games (that  I play) with the 9800X3D, but that's about it. The biggest upgrade is the name of the CPU and ""bragging"" rights.",Positive
AMD,"Now imagine how ballistic it would have been if the price of 7800x3d wouldn't rise to it's original MSRP, but stayed where it was during summer of 2024. 8% (or something I don't remember) worse performance for over 40% less (If my math is right).   How AMD managed to raise the price, if it was with slowing down the production, leading to decreased supply or with just selling it for more is kind of irrelevant in this context, as we're just interested in price. The point is that they can do the same here, making 9850x3d artificially more compelling product by simply raising the price of 9800x3d just before 9850x3d launches.    The price of 7800x3d reached an all time high just about when the 9800x3d was released. I don't think that's a coincidence. Looking at price history in December 2024 when the 9800x3d was barely available the price of 7800x3d went back to it's original launch price (at least here in Sweden) with the price creeping up since August of 2024.   Sure it's how market works, but It's not *all* market. AMD did something, and they might do it again, that's my point.",Negative
AMD,"Ok, but did they ever lower it?   The price listed on their website is not the price wholesale or retailers pay. Just because they didn't raise or lower it on their website doesn't mean they didn't change the price they sell at to wholesale. It's not like many consumers buy directly from AMD anyway.",Neutral
AMD,I have been eyeing a pretty  budget upgrade for sub 500 with 7600x3d wondering how dumb an idea  that would be.  Right it’s  between 400 and 420 at micro center. Would be for a mostly gaming setup would be upgrading from 3800x.,Negative
AMD,"That doesn’t mean he’s not getting one open-box. I’ve seen them at Microcenter for around the price previously mentioned. There was no mention of a bundle, just the processor.

More budget‑oriented devices, like ASUS TUF or the recent Gigabyte A16 Pro, tend to launch whenever.

AMD,"> Do we know that Zen 6 is going to prefer something faster than 6000MHz CL30?  Well for starters, Zen 4/5 do. There are two optimal zones; the first is max uclk (typically 6200-6600) and the second is max memclk (typically 7600-8400). See e.g. https://i.redd.it/u9v98iu9wlac1.png. Everything north of 6000 is all quite comparable, albeit with a couple of performance peaks.  Building on that, there is one core reason that lower memclks like 6200 are ever competitive; **it's because the older version of the infinity fabric severely bottlenecks memory bandwidth.**  We used 1900 FCLK with the same bandwidth per clock for DDR4-3800.  FCLK is a bit faster now, but it was not made any wider for DDR5 when it would have had to double in width to keep parity. A 2200 FCLK on the Raphael / Granite Ridge IO Die can carry all of the data from dual channel DDR-4400.  Above that, it bottlenecks to varying degrees.  * DDR5-6000 does a bandwidth of up to 96 GB/s. * DDR5-8000 does a bandwidth of up to 128 GB/s. * The fabric is only 70 GB/s wide at 2200 FCLK.  You can see the problem here, even at 6000 it often just can't keep up with the memory. Increasing bandwidth capability on the memory side is barely increasing the amount of bandwidth that can arrive at the CPU cores because usually it's bottlenecked by the interconnect, not by the memory itself.  This means that bandwidth scaling - and thus performance scaling - from DDR5-6000 up to DDR5-8400+ is severely crippled, and where you should see an enormous improvement you instead get only a slight one. This is **not** the normal situation for memory scaling, it is an unusual deviation which should not neccesarily be expected to continue.  Furthermore, there is still a significant latency benefit (~3-4ns) from setting UCLK=FCLK, but to utilise that at the moment we have to either run DDR5-8800 (which we can't hit) or we have to drop FCLK. Dropping FCLK means worsening the interconnect bandwidth bottleneck even further.  If the interconnect were wider, we could more afford to clock it down a bit and get that sweet latency benefit. That would benefit 2:1:1 mode (e.g. 8000mt/s with 2000uclk = 2000 fclk)  If the memory controller were just a bit faster, we could clock it up to uclk=fclk at ~DDR5-8800, and then we'd stop there as it would be the performance peak - and very substantially faster than DDR5-6000 with a desynced FCLK. Again, benefits 2:1:1 mode (8800mt/s with 2200uclk = 2200 fclk).  Zen 6 is alledgedly using AMD's new interconnect, which is alledgedly less of a bottleneck.",Neutral

AMD,:),Neutral
AMD,"HBDIMM support is a possibility, but i don't see Zen 6/7 having it in popular use.  The fabric right now does 64GB/s read.  Dual channel DDR5-9000, which their last gen CPU's hit with ease already, can feed 144 GB/s read.  That's +125% available bandwidth from utilising clocks that they can already hit, with the same amount of memory channels, the same memory, just making the interconnects in the CPU wider.  More bandwidth more better if it's free, but HB-DIMM must be more expensive and have a latency penalty. Bad tradeoffs unless bandwidth starved.  APU's can use all of the BW that they can get, and i'm curious if AMD was looking at a super APU package with HB DIMMs around zen 6 or 7.",Neutral

Most of the reason a laptop is “slow” is bloatware and has nothing to do with the cpu choice anyway.  And Intel is already “beating” AMD in laptop cpu sales, by a substantial margin.

Yes AMD is handily winning there.",Neutral

I work in tech for years, not an expert in laptops area but I can assure you that new CPUs from Intel that I mentioned earlier are way, way, way better than previous generations.",Positive
AMD,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works. It's like the 2001 Toyota of the laptop world, it's not winning prizes for looks, but it'll never die, gets good mileage (battery life), and is easily repairable. Maybe not the laptop you want, but definitely the one you need (excluding people who need something like a dedicated GPU or really need super high CPU performance).",Positive

AMD,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good. It seems the Intel chip was designed to be very efficient during periods of downtime and something like viewing a PDF or editing a document has a LOT of downtime for the CPU",Positive

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance.

AMD,"Two things can be true at the same time. Arrow lake has legitimately improved since it launched last year, and Intel is portraying it in the best, most optimal light they can that is probably not representative of a broad spectrum of games reviewed by a third party.   It would be interesting to get a retest of arrow lake now, but I dunno if it is worth the time investment for some reviewer like TPU or HWUB to re-review a relatively poor platform that’s already halfway out the door.",Positive
AMD,"Arrow Lake performs quite well at general compute and power efficiency compared to prior generatons ans even against AMD.  Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU. Ironically the 9070 performance was identical with a 9700X and a 9800X3D.  So it's actually kind of the reverse, gaming reviewers painted Arrow Lake in the worst possible light.",Neutral

AMD,"The answer depends on whether or not you're a ""next-gen AI gamer"" (apparently that means 1080p avg fps with a RTX 5090).",Neutral
AMD,I doubt they would give false numbers. Those are probably what you get with the setup they list in fine print. Also they pretty clearly show the 3dx parts are faster in gaming. But they have probably picked examples that show them in a good light.   There is nothing wrong per se in the arrow lake lineup. In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all. The issue that destroyed the image of arrow lake is that the previous generation was often faster in gaming. That made every reviewer give it bad overall reviews.,Neutral

AMD,"generally they cherry pick, so maybe the demo they use is process heavy with minimal I/O (arrow's biggest performance hit is memory movement). if you manage to keep memory movement low core performance is actually really good on arrow lake. it just gets massacred by d2d and NGU latency, which they don't get a pass for but its unfortunate that decent core designs are held back severely by packaging.",Negative

AMD,"As a real world example, I upgraded my primary system from a 14700k to a 265k recently.

That is not in windows, but my os which does not have thread director or custom scheduling for e cores. (So going to be worse than windows or Linux)   All the numbers except the 7900 are with the same ssd, psu, custom water loop.  The motherboard and cpu changed between Intel builds and the 3950x was the previous build before the 14700k.   The e core performance significantly improved in arrow lake.  It’s now keeping up with 16 core am4 parts in the worst possible scenario for it.  If the scheduler was smarter, I think it would be very close to the 7900.   In windows, it’s pretty close in games I play on frame rate to the old chip. A few are actually faster.",Neutral

AMD,The ones with similar pricing not performance,Neutral
AMD,"True, except AM5 supported all cpus 7000, 9000 and will support the newest one.

Well, you need a new board. So it depends what “cheaper” is seen as.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep. We all see the patterns here. Gamers nexus, HUB, LTT and most big name they all keep mocking Intel, even when Intel did good job to bring improvements to their products like fixing Arrow Lake gaming performance but those ""tech reviewer"" decided to be blind, they don't even want to revisit Intel chip and benchmark it, they don't even want to educate their viewers.    At the same time they keep overhyping Amd products to the moon like they own the stock, it's obvious now who is the real reviewer and who is fraud reviewer using their own popularity and big headline to spread their propaganda for their own benefits.

The fact that you can go from a 1700x to a 5800x3d on the same mobo for 85% more performance is crazy good value. You can say that all you want but there's a reason why in the diy market everyone is buying amd over intel. People know arrow lake is doa where as am5 actually has a future, which is why everyone is flocking to the 9800x3d in droves.  Zen 7 is rumored to be on am5 as well. Meaning that am6 would come out in 2030/2031. If that's true am5 lived for around 8/9 years.  That's insane value to get out of one socket.",Positive

Most tend to skimp, only to end up buying another middling CPU the following year, and then again after that. And so the cycle trundles on.  When I buy PC parts, I usually go for the best available. Provided the price is reasonably sane. I picked up a 9900K seven years ago and it’s still holding its own. Is it on par with the 9800X3D? Of course not. But it’s still a very capable bit of kit.

AMD,"# Alienware 34 - AW3425DWM resolution issues  [](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrawidemasterrace/?f=flair_name%3A%22Tech%20Support%22)  I just got the AW3425DWM, and my laptop is a Dell Inspiron 15 5510, which is not a gaming laptop. I'm not a gamer.  When connecting through the HDMI port on the laptop and monitor, I can't set the resolution to 3440x1440; I can go up to 3840x2160, but not the monitor's native resolution. However, when I connect through the USB-C port on the laptop to the DisplayPort on the monitor, I can set the resolution to 3440x1440 without any issues. The downside is that I've lost the only Thunderbolt port I have available.  Is there a workaround for this issue? If I use an HDMI to DisplayPort adapter, will I be able to set the resolution to 3440x1440?  I understand that the HDMI 1.4 port usually can handle 21:9 resolutions, but with the latest Intel drivers, it isn't giving me the option for 3440x1440",Negative

AMD,"Hi all,  I ordered a contact frame from Thermal Grizzly because the temperature of my CPU wasn’t great, and I was tired of the fan noise.   I installed the contact frame in August, and everything was fine until two weeks ago, when the desktop suddenly stopped booting. The fans were spinning, but there was no POST, no debug LED — nothing. I thought the motherboard was dead.   However, when I removed the AIO head and tried to boot again, it worked!  Since then, I’ve been experiencing intermittent no-POST issues, especially after gaming sessions.   To get it to boot, I always have to adjust the screws on the AIO head. If it’s too tight: no POST. If it’s too loose: CPU temperatures are high. For example, in Hogwarts Legacy, I get around 60 FPS with an RTX 4090, while the CPU runs at around 18% usage @ 85°C. Which is not normal at all, as I used to run the game at around 100–110 FPS.  I tightened the screws on the contact frame using my thumb and index fingers.   I’m looking for advice from anyone who has encountered a similar issue, because at this point my only idea is to remove the contact frame and reinstall the original one.  For context, my setup is from November 2022, and I installed the contact frame in August 2025. I have never removed the CPU from the socket since the first installation.  Thank you all.",Negative

AMD,"Intel ARC b580 apparently unable to run games in the snowdrop engine, but in such a way that it's almost impossible for benchmarkers/testers to catch.  I've been trying to run Avatar Frontiers of Pandora on my arc b580 for over a year now, and I keep having the same extremely unusual crash.  If I freshly reinstall the game, or change my operating system, or switch arc driver version, I can play the game normally, at regular framerates, with no issues, for around an hour. MAYBE two if I'm lucky.   The game then crashes, with seemingly no trigger. No thermal issues, no unusual resource usage, no memory leak, no framerate issues, no stuttering, not even a crash report. The game will just close as if I had closed it manually.   I don't crash in the same location every time, it crashes with different game settings, xess enabled/disabled, different monitors, different ram configurations. I can have the framerate capped or uncapped. GPU maxed out or not, power draw high or low. I can't consistently recreate the crash in the same way every time. The only certainty is that it WILL crash eventually.  After crashing once, It will then crash on game launch, every single time. The game opens, the epilepsy warning flashes up for a second or two, and then the game crashes in the same way, with no freeze, no crash report, just the game closing.  Since the game runs fine for an hour or so after I first install it, any benchmarker testing the gpu will likely never see the crash, because they install the game, run benchmarks, do their tests, and then close it before seeing anything wrong.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and have NOT worked.  * Updating graphics drivers (to both the latest absolute driver, and latest WHQL certified driver). * Downgrading graphics drivers (going all the way back to the first game ready drivers for the b580). * Updating windows (latest windows 10 and latest windows 11 versions). * Running a memory diagnostic * Enabling/disabling XMP. * Verifying integrity of game files. * Forcing the game to run in the Vulkan engine instead of snowdrop. * Performing a complete reinstall of the game. * Replacing one of the .dll files with a ""repaired"" one. (this apparently fixed a crash for some people). * Forcing the game to boot in dx11 instead of dx12.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and HAVE worked.  * Running the game on my AMD integrated graphics.  Obviously running the game on an igpu doesn't offer playable performance, but the game will run, and I've yet to find any crash, even leaving the game open for several hours.  Due to this issue, I'm on the verge of selling my b580 and replacing it with a different card from another manufacturer that hopefully won't have the same issue.

AMD,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Neutral

When the cooler is tightened too much, it can cause the CPU or motherboard to bend slightly, which may lead to poor or lost contact between the CPU and the socket pins. This prevents the processor from initializing properly, resulting in a no-POST condition. Installing a contact frame changes the pressure distribution compared to the stock retention mechanism, so overtightening the AIO screws can amplify this issue. On the other hand, if the screws are too loose, the CPU temperatures will rise because the cooler is not making proper thermal contact.

AMD,"u/Any_Information429 Your HP EliteBook 830 G8 is experiencing boot issues due to corrupted Intel Management Engine (ME) firmware, which is a critical low-level system component that manages hardware initialization. This corruption is causing the blinking caps lock light, multiple restart attempts before successful boot, and the extended Windows startup times you've been experiencing. The BIOS showing ""ME Firmware Mode: Recovery Mode"" confirms this diagnosis. Since these issues began after your recent repair, it's likely that the Management Engine chip connections were disturbed or the firmware became corrupted during the service process.  To resolve this, you need to perform a forced recovery of the ME firmware by downloading the specific firmware version for your EliteBook model from HP's support website-[HP EliteBook 830 G8 Notebook PC Software and Driver Downloads | HP® Support](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/hp-elitebook-830-g8-notebook-pc/38216726) and using specialized recovery tools to reflash the Management Engine. You also have check BIOS settings to ensure proper ME configuration and temporarily disable fast boot to allow complete initialization. If the firmware recovery doesn't resolve the issue, this may indicate hardware-level damage to the ME controller that occurred during the previous repair, which would require professional chip-level service or potentially warranty coverage since the problem originated after authorized service work. The good news is that once the ME firmware is properly restored, your system should return to normal boot times and eliminate the restart cycles you're currently experiencing.

When your laptop is plugged into the wall, your CPU can run at much higher power levels (probably around 28W or more), but when you switch to battery, it gets severely limited to maybe 8-15W to preserve battery life. This is especially true for ultrabooks like the Gram that prioritize being thin and light over raw performance. The thing is, a lot of this power management happens at the hardware level with Intel's built-in systems, which is why all those Windows power settings you tweaked aren't really making a difference - the CPU is basically ignoring them and doing its own thing to save battery.  Now, for a game like Final Fantasy XI, you should still be able to get it running decently on battery with some tweaks, but expecting that same smooth 60 FPS at max settings is probably unrealistic given the fundamental power constraints of ultrabook design. Most ultrabooks see this kind of 60-80% performance hit on battery for any sustained workload, so you're definitely not alone in this.   But honestly, this is just how these thin and light laptops are designed to work - they're amazing when plugged in, but they have to make compromises when running on battery to actually give you decent battery life.",Neutral
AMD,"u/Aggravating_Gap_203 I'd recommend running Intel's Processor Diagnostic Tool first to rule out any hardware defects with the CPU itself. Just download it from Intel's website, run the test, and let us know if it passes or fails. While you're at it, try loading your BIOS defaults and make sure your power settings are at Intel's recommended specs - PL1 should be around 125W and PL2 around 181W for your 14600KF-[Intel® Core™ i5 processor 14600KF](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/236778/intel-core-i5-processor-14600kf-24m-cache-up-to-5-30-ghz/specifications.html)  [Intel® Processor Diagnostic Tool](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/15951/intel-processor-diagnostic-tool.html)  Your friend is actually spot on about the contact frame recommendation. Before you buy one though, try remounting your cooler one more time - make sure you're tightening the screws in an X-pattern and that everything is perfectly aligned. Sometimes it just takes that perfect mount to get things working right. Let us know what the Intel diagnostic shows and we can go from there!",Neutral

AMD,"Most commenters are wrong or didn’t read all the articles. Nvidia wants some custom SKUs of server chips to pair with its data center GPUs, and Intel wanted a better solution for pc parts for the GPU tiles.   NVIDIA is NOT getting an x86 license, nor do they want one. In case you haven’t noticed, Nvidia is a $4T company largely on sales of data center GPUs, sales of which were 10x the gaming segment. Profit/earnings ratio of data center is even higher than the 10x.   In my opinion, the only reason for Intel to use RTX chiplets on pc parts is so they can have a few skus for mobile gaming. Lower end laptop chips would still use Xe cores.  This solves NONE of intel’s structural issues - they need, in this order  1. Major foundry customers  2. Regain server market share 3. Data center GPU offerings 4. Move all pc chiplets back to Intel nodes and start to fill up the fabs again",Neutral

AMD,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive. I know they have a lot of tricks up their sleeves still, like designing HBM memory onto the die (how Vega was supposed to be originally) and unified memory (soldered down, see the new AI branded chips).",Negative
AMD,Ohh noooerrrrrrrrr,Neutral
AMD,"Actually this may be good for AMD and I will tell you why: Open source drivers. Nvidia if they had a say in intels graphics division would make the intel GPU stuff proprietary and locked down and when support ends its gonna hurt. Meanwhile AMD has open source drivers and in the age that linux is gaining popularity will make it the preferred platform for anyone interested in the growing linux ecosystem. Nvidia will NEED to change how they handle things or intel may not be as attractive as they once were, intel has already suffered a massive knock on thier reputation and this may be the mortal wound that can work in AMD's favor.",Neutral
AMD,"I don't see how this means anything at all for AMD in desktop. This is borderline irrelevant for desktop gaming. Most users pick up an Intel or AMD CPU and an NVIDIA dGPU.  APUs don't really exist in desktop gaming.  In mobile? I think most people won't care much. Intel and AMD APUs both offer compelling and reasonable alternatives for everyday usage. Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.

AMD,Theres no way that nvidia is gonna let intel keep producing entry level gpus that directly compete with their own.

The only reason huge caches benefit gaming, is to benefit rushes to shipment by the publisher, so that game engineers either don't have to optimize, or they can use garbage like Unity, or both.

Also... diminishing returns, and I doubt AMD will put this in Zen 5 -- seems like a trash rumor, to me.",Negative
AMD,"3D cache will eventually become full of assets and dip, if and onlyif IMC is bottlenecked by random memory access.  - the ability for cache to transfer data from memory, to IMC, to cache has a FPS hit (cache hit-rate). This is due to the bottleneck of a chiplet-based IOD: compromising memory latency with cache hit-rate. Eventually the cache fills and relying on IMC to feed the cores anyway.  You can easily test this by monitoring 1% lows and increasing memory latency (lowering DDR4 B-die clocks/DDR5 hynix and increasing timings) to see how Cache holds up when full of assets while memory is being bottlenecked-   What games need is 10-12 P-Cores and an IMC capable of high speeds.

AMD,The bad optimisation critics aremostly people trying to sound smart by rambling things they dont understand.  Game engines are very optimized these days.   Its funny they mostly pick on Unreal Engine 5 as the prime example... That is probably the most complete game engine out there. So naturally its hard to make all that stuff work well togetter...

AMD,Mixed cores are awesome if the scheduler would do what i want and there lies the problem and i dont think even AI can solve that yet.,Negative
AMD,"I said IPC of Zen 4 is the SAME and weaker than Zen 4 is weaker than Skymont in IPC. No more no less. As for clocks, the core scales to max 5.2ghz (default 4.6ghz), certainly overall slower than Zen 4. IPC is a comparison about throughput at a given clockspeed. Its a give to compare you will need to match the clocks.  Funny you you should mention latencies, considering that core to core (even accross clusters), latencies of Skymont are better than Lion Cove? So if latency is the issue, it has nothing to do with Skymont and everything to do with the trash uncore they have based on the Meteorlake SOC. Even workstation Crestmont on a different package performs better. Furthermore skymont IPC is measured based on Arrowlake. Arrowlake is worse latency than Raptorlake and Zen already. Latencies have been accounted for.",Negative

AMD,Never count out Intel. They have some very talented people over there.,Negative
AMD,"Regarding the cache optimizations you pointed out, I have a question. Can you test all APO supported games you own and capture the utilization of the E-cores ?  My understanding is that Intel is keeping 1 E-core per cluster active and parking the remaining 3 E-cores. So the lone E-core of each cluster has full access to the 4mb shared L2. For the i9 they can have 4 such solitary E-cores that have their own cache and hence do not touch the L3 cache. The 4 E-cores handle background task while the 8 P-cores with the full 36mb L3 cache deal with the games.  Please correct me if I am wrong.  Also, what cpu cooler do you use ?",Neutral

AMD,Balanced in full load will just do the same thing as High Performance.,Neutral
AMD,"It's capable of a few things, but the main mechanism from what I've seen is that it temporarily disables three out of four cores in each E-core cluster by forcing them into the lowest power state. The result is that the remaining active core has access to each cluster's full L2 cache (2MB on 12th-gen, 4MB on 13th/14th-gen). L2 cache isn't shared with P-cores (L3 is global), so this can really minimize E-core cache evictions before they're forced into slower memory, and games do love themselves some cache.  It's a genuinely clever way of maximizing available resources and I really wish they'd allow user control over its features, but it seems to be pretty tightly leashed to/by the team that developed it. It obviously wouldn't benefit every situation, such as particularly low/high thread occupancy situations, but it's pretty rough to have the option tied to quarterly updates for one or two specific games.",Neutral

AMD,They are they came up with ML for their upscaller before the red team did and even better than FSR as a dump upscaler and they also did a good RT implementation. But the hardware still has raw horse power issues and they already use a big die for what it can do.  In the 80's or they shammed The DEC Alpha team on subnormal floating point operations with the 8087 FPU. Intel was doing way more precession without having to round so earlier on a consumer FPU while the Alpha CPU was a Mainframe one. Intel also gave it up to help estandardize the way CPUs handle floating point types.  Intel compilers were also black magic becuase they optimized so much C and C++ for Intel specifically but there was always controversy causeless AMD x86 couldn't take part of those optimizations,Neutral

AMD,"Great explanation that makes sense!  It definitely has to do with the cache, that much is true.   A Raptor Lake CPU with 8 P cores and no efficiency cores, with 36MB of L3 would perform exceptionally well in games.

Remember AMD didn't have any ai hardware for their first 2 gens on RDNA and RDNA 3 didn't have enough for FSR4 either. It's not that intel were better at producing a ML upscaler. They just had the hardware for it from the get go so they could implement it quicker.  They did make Xess though which is miles ahead of FSR 3 even on AMD systems (on average. FSR3 is pretty good when modded and can be competitive) so they do have some extremely talented people there.

When I was testing some stuff out (trying to see how close I could get my Deck to the Switch 2 build) I found Xess to be a unsuitable. Even on the lightest Xess mode, the performance hit was a bit too noticeable. FSR doesn't look as good as Xess but it runs better and you can get away with a bit more upscaling artifacting on the Decks relatively small screen. Just rendering at a lower res and letting the screen upscale was also a solid option in that scenario.  As I say though, that's an edge case where you really just need outright speed. If your GPU doesn't support DLSS or FSR4 then using Xess makes sense in the vast majority of cases.",Neutral

AMD,Not sure I can trust Intel again after the BS around Arrow Lake and the lack of ongoing LGA 1851 upgrade path.,Negative
AMD,Bout time,Neutral
AMD,"Like I commented before, hope (but really don't believe) this is NOT the product that is only 10% faster than arrowlake because liquidation awaits them otherwise",Negative
AMD,Will it be available in fall of this year or 26Q1?,Neutral
AMD,So it only took them like 5 years to come up with a luke-warm response. cool cool. It's especially bad as Intel actually introduced something similar (eDRAM LLC) into the x86 space many years ago.,Positive
AMD,Noob question:  Is this their 16th gen chips?,Neutral
AMD,Planning on upgrading from my 13700K to whatever the top end Nova Lake is,Neutral
AMD,Only Core i3 can have 65watt ? no more i5 at 65Watt ?,Neutral
AMD,"For some reason it seems to me that all these new different micro cores are cores from ten years ago at the level of Broadwell or Lynnfield, but made on thin nm to fit everything under one lid lmao",Neutral
AMD,"What is it with Intel and 8 ""pcores""  how about just do 24 cores 48 threads",Neutral
AMD,Cool.  I have said for a while now that is want both the extra cache AND a few lesser cores to offload stuff to.  The only alternative that has this atm is the 9900x3d and the 9950x3d.  Next gen when im buying new stuff then perhaps intel will have an alternative to those then.,Neutral
AMD,"The 52 cores is exciting, but I would probably use Linux as my main OS and run Windows in a VM. Plenty of cores and plenty of RAM and it would be a great machine.  A 52 core desktop beast with an Intel graphics card with 128 GB VRAM would be a killer machine. LLMs would run like lightening.",Positive
AMD,"Intel mocking the chiplet design, describing it as gluing processors together and then doing it themselves - this screams that energy once again.",Neutral
AMD,So Nova Lake IS happening? This talk about skipping to next node had me anxious..,Negative
AMD,"So alder lake on cache steroids ?  If the heavier core count chips don’t have the LLc cache, and if this chip is faster at gaming than the heavier core count chips, how will Intel market it?   If they call it a core ultra 5 or 7, then that will make the core ultra 9 seem less of a halo product.  Will be interesting to see how they market it.",Neutral
AMD,"E core need to get lost for gaming, we need 9800x3d rival, purely for gaming !",Neutral
AMD,"""E-Cores"",  Ewww, Gross.",Neutral
AMD,"**Hi,**  I’m currently running a 9700K paired with a 5070 Ti. Do you think I should upgrade to Arrow Lake Refresh now, or hold out for Nova Lake?  The CPU’s clearly starting to bottleneck a bit, but it’s not super noticeable yet.  Is it worth waiting for Nova Lake, or better to just go with Arrow Lake Refresh when it drops?",Neutral
AMD,NVL will definitely be the 400 series. PTL is 300.,Neutral
AMD,"Naming can be changed, but the most important thing is, this isn't the upcoming arrow lake refresh  I hope arrow lake refresh fix the memory controller latency tho",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, I expect the 300 series to be Arrow Lake refresh and Panther Lake.",Neutral
AMD,"> (Not sure what suffix Intel will use to denote bLLC SKU maybe ""L"")  Maybe they will bring back the ""C"" from i7-5775C.   Behold, the Core Ultra 7 465KFC",Neutral
AMD,I suspect it'll be like:  495K: 16+32.  485K: 12/14+24/32.  475K: 8+16.  465K: 8+12.  Etc.,Neutral
AMD,Seeing all those different cores on a chip does look cool. But I presume this idea will end up being butchered by Windows not being able to schedule things properly,Neutral
AMD,"So if Arrow Lake Refresh comes out this year, next year we'll get Nova Lake? Or in 2027? Either way Zen 6 vs Nova Lake will be interesting.",Positive
AMD,Taking the 'L' to their own CPUs would generally be considered a bad marketing move.,Negative
AMD,"We'll see how far Zen 6 takes us on memory. Strix has improvements, hopefully that wasn't all of it though.",Neutral
AMD,"If intel doesn't screw itself with stupid tdp, reliability issues, or bad relative performance",Negative
AMD,More like *despite* him.,Neutral
AMD,All the SKUs rumored so far are BLLC,Neutral
AMD,"They have graduated from background tasks. At this point, even LPE cores can handle apps like Microsoft teams by themselves with no issue never mind the E cores on the ring bus",Neutral
AMD,"If the scheduler can really support this. As soon as a game would hit the e cores, it could turn bad.",Negative
AMD,Why not 8 P cores with HT + even more cache and no e cores at all,Neutral
AMD,"A large L3 will help a ton with latency. It's why AMD has so much success with it using chiplets which have a ton of extra latency. Reduces all those higher latency trips out to RAM. Intel's Nova Lake processors are expected to feature the memory controller integrated back into the CPU tile and if that's the case this L3 might be a really big hit for gaming, etc.",Positive
AMD,If latency slightly increases or stays the same due to adopting Pantherlake optimizations and the newer Foveros then that might be enough to narrow the gap,Neutral
AMD,I assume the cache is based on Lunar Lake's memory side cache which doesn't bring much if any noticeable latency over Arrowlake H,Neutral
AMD,"Also done with them. Changing socket every \~3 years was also bad, but this is disgusting.",Negative
AMD,"Not sure how it could be, given all the extra cores.  That said, for lower core count workloads, like gaming, I doubt gains of more than 10% are achievable by anyone, at this point.  I expect NVL to be a big power/thermals/multithreading win, than anything else.",Neutral
AMD,Nova lake? More like 26Q4.,Neutral
AMD,Only Pantherlake for mobile,Neutral
AMD,"It doesn’t matter so long as all major vendors will automatically ship with whatever Intel puts out. Lenovo, dell, and HP carry a grand total of *zero* desktop Zen 5 (granite ridge) machine across their consumer, gaming, and business line. You heard that right, *zero* among the global big three.",Neutral
AMD,"Since when they are ""mocking chiplet design""? Have you forgot Intel is the first when it comes to gluing chip together? Intel did this with Core 2 Quad. Meanwhile Amd copying that with ryzen but sadly people don't want to admit it.",Neutral
AMD,It is really happening. The only question is when? Or can they release it on the next year without delay?,Neutral
AMD,"Core Ultra 9 has 48 cores (and 4 LPE cores). It slaps you in the face as halo SKU (unless it becomes entry level threadripper target?).  Currently rumored:  (8+16E+BLLC, 8+16E)  8+16E+BLLC  8+12E+BLLC",Neutral
AMD,The i9 sku is rumored to be two 8+16 tiles. So slotting in an extra bLLC 8+16 tile instead of a normal 8+16 one for the top sku doesn't sound impossible.,Neutral
AMD,Probably same way AMD did the 5800X3D 8 core which was slower than the 5800X at productivity and had less cores than the 12 core 5900X and 16 core 5950X.,Neutral
AMD,"E cores are the future, P cores days are numbered.",Neutral
AMD,ARL refresh is not worth it. Go AMD or wait for NVL if you want.,Neutral
AMD,If you have to upgrade now for gaming get a 9800x3d from AMD otherwise wait and see what AMD Zen 6 and Nova Lake can do.,Neutral
AMD,"You just missed some pretty killer deals around Prime Day; that would have been the ideal time to go with Arrow Lake.  The 'refresh' will offer better performance, but I highly doubt the value difference will be significant.     You can definitely wait a bit.",Negative
AMD,"I would like the naming with suffix ""C"" for cache at the end or maybe ""G"" for gaming.",Neutral
AMD,"W11 has (mostly) fixed the scheduling issues, in fact the scheduler was already pretty good by the time Raptor Lake launched. Sometimes it can mess things up but it's quite rare nowadays. The only time I have seen some small issues is with legacy single threaded software.",Neutral
AMD,"Why would it be butchered? the issues with big/little are long gone now - but I guess to your type none of that matters - getting upvotes for blind anti-MS zealotry is all that matters.  but given that this is an intel sub, i am surprised its not merely blind anti intel zealotry instead.",Negative
AMD,">So if Arrow Lake Refresh comes out this year, next year we'll get Nova Lake?  Yes. Intel has confirmed NVL will launch in 2026.",Neutral
AMD,The former ceo,Neutral
AMD,"Raichu has repeatedly talked about BLLC ""variants"", so I wouldn't assume that all skus have the large L3.   Plus, it seems extremely wasteful to have all the skus have BLLC.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, Skymont are more like space efficient P cores that are down clocked and don't have all of the features. IPC is really good.",Positive
AMD,This is wrong. Arrow Lake already uses E cores for gaming to no performance hit.   12-14th Gen sure. But not with the new E cores and no HT. You’re using dated info.,Negative
AMD,"A number of public tests have shown that, even with all the P-cores disabled, ARL is still pretty good in gaming.  It's not the E-cores.",Positive
AMD,No different to 12-14th gen then.,Neutral
AMD,"windows pretty much gave up on this and just allows you to set to performance mode, which always tries to grab a P core first.",Neutral
AMD,"Or that I forgot they don't have HT on the newer chips.   To be honest I was meaning 14th gen P and E cores with more cache not the new gen stuff. We know the IPC, memory controller and core speed is enough it's just the cache that makes it fall behind AMD in gaming.",Neutral
AMD,E core is 30% faster than hyper threading,Neutral
AMD,HT is worse than E cores,Negative
AMD,>Intel's Nova Lake processors are expected to feature the memory controller integrated back into the CPU tile  They aren't,Neutral
AMD,It will enlarge the ontile L3 cache most likely with a cache only tile with high performance die to die connect. No 3d stacking until 18A-PT is available for production which will likely be well after Nova Lake tapeout which should be done now or with in the next few months in order to ramp up production in early 2026 and be on the market by late 2026.,Neutral
AMD,">That said, for lower core count workloads, like gaming, I doubt gains of more than 10% are achievable by anyone, at this point.  If you are in the lead, maybe this argument is valid. However Intel is behind Apple in ST and behind AMD in gaming. They have plenty of room to improve.",Neutral
AMD,"> That said, for lower core count workloads, like gaming, I doubt gains of more than 10% are achievable by anyone, at this point  And yet we see that constantly.",Negative
AMD,"Ze3vsZen2, Zen 4vsZen3, Zen 5 X3D vs Zen 4 X3D, Alderlake vs RocketLake, Raptorlake vs AlderLake, Lunarlake/Arrowlake-H (Mobile) vs Meteorlake U and H, Gracemont vs Tremont, Skymont vs Gracemont and Crestmont, Many Arm or Arm based designs, etc",Neutral
AMD,ARM chips regularly do this sometimes on a yearly basis.,Neutral
AMD,A lot of gamers have no clue that Intel is actually doing well with ARL for OEM laptops/dekstops as ARL is basically a laptop design warmed over for desktop chip usage.,Neutral
AMD,Core 2 quads and Ryzen chiplets are totally different ways of doing MCMs  C2Q didnt have an IO die and it pretty much worked like having a 2 socket motherboard      IO die is what enabled much lower latency and the ability to connect much more CPU dies together (EPYC 9005 got 16 CCDs),Neutral
AMD,https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-slide-criticizes-amd-for-using-glued-together-dies-in-epyc-processors/,Neutral
AMD,"> They stopped trying to sell capacity to external customers and they will try again with 14a. It's not like they had a lot of capacity to spare. It's not even enough for themselves  Intel claims they can double to 1.5x their EUV capacity in arizona and ireland, if customers asked for it, in 1-2 years.   They built out all they needed for their own internal 18A demand too.",Neutral
AMD,"It shouldn't become an entry level workstation part since the Ryzen 9 will have 24c/48t to go against it.   48 cores (plus the 4 LPe, but those shouldn't factor in too much) should handily beat 48 threads, but not by enough to reach Threadripper territory.",Neutral
AMD,Most likely the bLLC variant wil be single compute tile and single cache tile as this would be cheaper for now than putting bLLC cache in base tile like Amd did. They can do that when 18A-PT is avaliable which will probably be after Nova Lake goes into production with 18A or maybe 18A-P,Neutral
AMD,"Lmao, some of my games still runs on e cores",Neutral
AMD,People are still disabling e cores for more performance.,Neutral
AMD,"Varients because there are two tiles. One with BLLV, one without. Full chip had 1 BLLC chip and 1 without. No actual SKU (not tile) without BLLC in some way so far",Neutral
AMD,"They are nothing like P-core as designed with no hyperthreading, area/space efficienct and integrated into clusters of 4 e-cores with shared L2 cache",Neutral
AMD,fym no different they're 50% faster,Neutral
AMD,No. ARL architecture is definitely not optimized for latency but hiding memory access which favours multithreading instead of gaming. Hopefully Nova Lake will optimize all the latecy issues with ARL arch and decrease latency to L3 considerably aswell,Negative
AMD,"Yes, but in games, it's the P-cores that are meant to be utilized. Also, more than eight cores or 16 threads aren't really necessary for gaming. The 9950x3d isn't faster, than the 9900x3d.  My point is that the space taken up by the E-cores could instead be used for additional cache, not?",Neutral
AMD,I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it. Anyhow if that's true the large L3 should be even more helpful for things like gaming as it will keep those higher latency hits down. AMD has always had higher latency due to the same kind of design with a separate memory controller so we have pretty good data on how extra cache can help.,Neutral
AMD,"As a advice, Nova Lake will further increase memory latency.",Neutral
AMD,In which gen iteration?,Neutral
AMD,Editorialized. But its funny because said quote is attributed to AMD when Intel made Core2Duo (or Quad?),Neutral
AMD,"If its is with 10% of threadripper 9960x at half the price, it will definitely hurt the low end threadripper cpus a lot for productivity/creator types who would love a more reasonable priced high performance entry level workstaion. Low end workstation is probably bigger market than high end gaming desktops anyways.",Negative
AMD,"Another factor is that Apple has booked out all the N2 capacity for the better part of a year before AMD can touch it.  Nova Lake will have been out for a while, before AMD shows up",Neutral
AMD,Process lasso can let you just designate by task so the E cores can do background and side jobs. People use process lasso on the 7950x3d to make the X3D chiplet run games with those 8 cores and the other 8 core chiplet for everything else.,Neutral
AMD,What issue did you run into with a 9800x3d? It has one CCD and no small cores,Neutral
AMD,"Nowadays there are very few cases where disabling E cores is extremely beneficial, sometimes they are a detriment to performance but more often than not they are useful. Not to mention the E core design team is more competent than the P core team and are quickly catching up in performance.    The E cores in Alder Lake had relatively poor ST performance but in Arrow Lake they are much faster and closer to the P cores in raw performance. Every new generation the gap keeps shrinking and it will make the disabling of E cores less and less relevant.    Sometimes the Windows scheduler will wrongly assign an E core to a ST bound task, even if a P core is available, but it doesn't happen often enough to be a serious issue.",Neutral
AMD,"yes, but not because of windows scheduling - its because you can OC higher with them off - better temps and easier stability - some people disable HT for the same.",Neutral
AMD,They don't pay attention,Negative
AMD,"No. Intel needs to do what Amd did and add seperate bLLC just for gaming. As long as latency is reduced to the L3 cache including bLLC, gaming performance will definitely increase as 285K and 9950x have similar performance in both gaming and productivity with small lead going to Amd. But x3d totally dominates ARL beacsue of the obvious huge cache difference and lower overall latency to their cache implementation.",Neutral
AMD,That is more so bc the 9950x3d isn’t really a 16 core cpu it is two 8 cores,Neutral
AMD,"There was one article a while back that reported something like ""intel goes back to integrated mc"", not understanding that panther lake is a fundamentally different product than the tile based desktop products.",Neutral
AMD,How do you think they're doing 2 compute tiles if the memory controller is on one?,Neutral
AMD,">I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it.  I'm curious, which leakers have said otherwise?   You could still have mem latency improvements without the mem controller being on the compute tile too, so the situation there can improve either way.   >AMD has always had higher latency due to the same kind of design with a separate memory controller so we have pretty good data on how extra cache can help  Yup, and ARL has higher mem latency than AMD even, so obviously there is room to improve even without having to move the mem controller back.",Neutral
AMD,"Intel will definitely decrease latency with Nova lake and as long as they add a bigger L3 cache variant, gaming performance will increase further to challenge AMD",Positive
AMD,"If you go straight to the source, the quote they used is directly on Intel's slides. Intel literally wrote that, regardless of who said it first.   [https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pPtQr2PKSemDqkhahtz8VN.jpg](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pPtQr2PKSemDqkhahtz8VN.jpg)",Neutral

AMD,"NVL high end desktop skus are rumored to be on N2 as well. Intel has confirmed NVL desktop will be on TSMC, and Intel has also confirmed some NVL compute tiles will be external.   It's very possible Zen 6 DT is out before NVL-S, and it's very likely that NVL-S and Zen 6 launch within a few months of each other, if that even.   Also, if AMD wants to pay for TSMC N2 capacity, TSMC will build it out. Just a couple days ago we had a [report](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250724PD213/tsmc-2nm-capacity-2028-3nm.html) about TSMC being very aggressive with N2 scale out, and the reasoning here is two fold- first of all, 2026 is technically the 2nd year of N2 HVM, and also because a *lot* of major SOCs, other than just Apple and AMD, will be on N2- demand for N2 is high, and build out will be too.",Neutral
AMD,AMD is one of the leading N2 early adopters. Both TSMC and AMD announced this.,Neutral
AMD,That didn't stop Intel with N3B,Neutral
AMD,The recent Warhammer space marine game is a game that benefited from disabling e cores. I am not sure the disparity between arrow and alder in that game tho.,Neutral
AMD,">Intel needs to do what Amd did and add seperate bLLC just for gaming.  Thats what I tried to say.  >My point is that the space taken up by the E-cores could instead be used for additional cache, not?  Or isn't that enough? AMD stacks the cache directly on top (9000 Series) or under (9000 series) the CPU cores, right?",Neutral
AMD,"Yes but IF Intel decides to do quad channel for AI nonsense at least for flagship model, Amd threadripper will be stomped over as I will definitely buy the Nova Lake part just for the price/performance compared to 9960x threadripper. The motherboard selection alone for Z890 is absolutely amazing and RDIMM prices aretwice as expensive for the same amount of memory. I expect with CAMM2 that max ram capaciity will go for 512GB and maybe 1TB for Nova Lake aswell. Even with 2 channel, cudimm will go above 10,000 MTS and maybe 12000 if we are lucky on CAMM2 modules by 2027 as CAMM2 definitely being used for DDR6   I do feel Intel has I/O advantage beyong gaming and that market is getting bigger than hardcore gamers all the time!! A decked out 256GB Arrow Lake z890 based computer is way cheaper than same memory sized threadripper 9960x.",Positive
AMD,"I don't recall Intel stating that NVL core chips would be at TSMC, only that some of the eventual package would be... which implies iGPU, to me, and that wouldn't be N2 (possibly N4, since Battlemage is N5, and N4 would be open and cheaper than N3 nodes).  Do you have a source, where they directly claim the NVL cores are coming from TSMC?",Neutral
AMD,"The game is a dumpster fire when it comes to CPU utilization, it hammers even top tier gaming chips like the 9800X3D. I'm not surprised if the E cores can bottleneck the performance even further, most likely some of the game's heaviest threads get (wrongly) assigned to the E cores.    The scheduling in W11 has been significantly improved over the last few years but it's not 100% perfect either. Legacy software in particular, which typically utilizes 1 core, often ends up running in an E core and as a result you can't take advantage of the higher ST performance a P core provides. In that case you need stuff like Process Lasso to fix the problem. It doesn't happen very often but when it does it's very annoying.",Negative
AMD,"Yup.   >. Then as you look forward, to our next-generation product for client after that, Nova Lake will actually have die both inside and outside for that process. So, you'll actually see compute tiles inside and outside.  Q4 2024 earnings call.",Neutral
AMD,"That seems really strange, since ARL was designed for both 18A and N3, and they just went with N3 at the time.  Now that 18A is ready, and capacity is reserved for Intel themselves, you'd think NVL would just plain be fabbed there.  Maybe the 18A fabs are so busy with Clearwater Lake orders, that they would go with TSMC again?  That seems like something they couldn't have known in 2024.",Neutral
AMD,"18A is about as good clockspeed as N2, but density is still around N3 level. To make a new architecture, it makes sense for them to target N2 if AMD does the same which they have",Neutral
