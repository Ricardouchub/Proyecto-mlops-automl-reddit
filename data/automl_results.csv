Intel,"I recently picked up an MSI Claw 7 AI+, and have been pleasantly surprised with the current state of their drivers. I would absolutely be interested in a Celestial GPU if they have anything targeting 9070~ or higher performance level. Here's hoping!",Positive
Intel,I'm glad they are doing these followup videos. Gotta give Intel credit where due - their cards are getting so much better over time.,Positive
Intel,They said their high idle power is an architecture issue so they can't fix that,Negative
Intel,God forbid Intel supports Day 1 GPU drivers longer than 5 years,Negative
Intel,"true but thats not really that big of a deal, and can be fixed with some tweaks [https://www.reddit.com/r/IntelArc/comments/161w1z0/managed\_to\_bring\_idle\_power\_draw\_down\_to\_1w\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntelArc/comments/161w1z0/managed_to_bring_idle_power_draw_down_to_1w_on/)",Neutral
Intel,"They usually do tho? We dont know about their dGPUs yet because it hasn't been 5 years.  Their Xe Laptop gpus are 5years+ and are supported as of this month.  No idea why you're hating on intel GPUs mate, i'm used to everyone cheering the underdog not the otherway around.",Neutral
Intel,"I think that guy's a misinformed user that is saying that AMD 5000/6000 series won't get driver updates anymore lol, when AMD just said that those gens aren't slated for game optimizations that use their ""latest technologies"" (FSR4 at the time of writing) anymore. Those gens still will get driver updates but AMD gave up on trying to implement FSR4 on them, like the leaked scripts earlier this year had performance reduction from 20% to up to 30% FPS to use FSR4 for 6000 series cards since they don't have the hardware and just using brute force software for FSR4.   I'd agree that my 6700 XT never getting FSR4 sucks, but the misinfo circling around is that we'd never get anymore driver updates lol.",Negative
Intel,"so the A, B, C, (etc) Series is just branding? and they dont think they have enough performance improvement in Xe3 to warrant a jump to a new branding name? … but Xe3 plus will be enough to call it C series.",Neutral
Intel,"I loved how Tom Peterson did the circuit of tech blogs, tubers, and related last Fall to announce and advocate for ARC Battlemage.  Looking forward to seeing alot of him over the next few months for Xe3 and ARC C-series",Positive
Intel,Everything about Celestial I've heard seems to be regarding mobile. Is there actually going to be dedicated discrete graphics?,Neutral
Intel,The Intel driver downloading a shader cache for games from Intel sounds very noteworthy.   I'm really skeptical tying GPU drivers to a manufacturer's online service.,Neutral
Intel,"They don't care. These will be mid tier chips at best. The RTX IGPU ones will be their flagships. These are still damn impressive though, just have to make that clear.",Negative
Intel,"The mega brains of this community really struggle with product naming lol, its so funny to watch supposed intelligent people straight faced say they can't work out what product out 6 to buy because of their product names, most of them are in different market segments so you can't even accidentally buy the wrong one.",Negative
Intel,"They may divide ABC depending on ISA/hardware capabilities used for example. Like AMD used ""RDNA 3.5"" on mobile as full RDNA 4 would pull more power due to more silicon dedicated to AI (including FSR 4 -\_-). RDNA 3.5 has a lot of ISA and part of hardware changes that went into RDNA 4. So Xe 3B will be better than current but Xe 3C will do better at DXR and/or AI frame gen/whatever new tech they added.",Neutral
Intel,"This will help you to understand: https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/intels-xe3-graphics-architecture-breaks-cover-panther-lakes-12-xe-core-igpu-promises-50-percent-better-performance-than-lunar-lake  This is not brand new architecture, it's refinement on battlemage to work more efficiently. Thinks of it as Xe2.5 but for some reason marketing is calling it Xe3.",Neutral
Intel,">they dont think they have enough performance improvement in Xe3 to warrant a jump to a new branding name?      No what he said is that the Arc B Series hasn't been around for all that long and the B580 has garnered a very positive reception so they felt in terms of branding and marketing moving in Panther Lakes Xe³ into the B series brand is a better marketing move than throwing away the B series branding and starting the C series branding now. In others words they want Panther Lake to ride on the momentum and positive vibes the B series branding has garnered.   Xe³ is a Xe³ based architecture like Xe³P is architecturally but there is more to selling a product than the engineering, keep in mind there's strong rumors that there will be a B770 launch, Intel also just released the B60 and later this year will provide a big software expansion to Bxx cards so the B series brand is still full of life. Xe³P will launch much later and at that point Intel feels there will have passed enough time to leave the B series branding behind.",Neutral
Intel,An alternative explanation could also be that Celestial dGPUs *are* launching as Xe3P and they would want the launch of C series iGPU and dGPU to be around the same time and the same architecture.,Neutral
Intel,">so the A, B, C, (etc) Series is just branding?  Wasnt it always so? Xe is the architectural names, ABC was just branding for customers.",Neutral
Intel,"No public announcements yet, but logically it would make all the sense for Intel to launch them, and do so in larger quantities so people in the market can get them at MSRP. Battlemage proved there is a lot more demand than there was supply, and it'd take too long to ramp it up once it became clear they were received well. With proof of a market test pass, they've now got a chance to do it right.  They are excellent value products that would allow Intel to get a chunk of that market, given they are available in sufficient quantities at intended price points.",Positive
Intel,Is shader caching on first use a real problem? Sounds like bored people needing something to cry about again.,Negative
Intel,>RDNA 3.5 has a lot of ISA and part of hardware changes that went into RDNA 4  Do you have a source for this? I vaguely remember 3.5 wasn't really bringing particular changes,Neutral
Intel,That's exactly what everyone's new GPU generation is.  An entirely new architecture is extremely rare for any company.,Neutral
Intel,That's not what Peterson was talking about context wise when he addressed this in the video.,Neutral
Intel,"They would be extremely stupid not to continue to release discrete graphics cards, even if they decide to release 2-3 gaming SKUs per new generation; entry/budget, mid-range, high-end, etc.  - they win. until they keep iterating up, maturing driver, increasing install user base, improving software, until the point they can target higher segments (enthusiast tier)  Gaming GPUs remain the flagship component that pushes the limits of silicon design, features like ray tracing, AI upscaling, and real time path racing all debut in gaming before trickling into pro and AI workloads. Every research report shows that demand for high-end GPUs is still strong. Steam HW survey shows the most popular GPUs are still mid-range gaming cards, showing that discrete GPUs remain central to the PC ecosystem.  And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",Neutral
Intel,[AMD RDNA 3.5’s LLVM Changes - by Chester Lam](https://chipsandcheese.com/p/amd-rdna-3-5s-llvm-changes),Neutral
Intel,"There are more to that, if you look at RDNA 4 and blackwell for example they had changes to the SMs, enc/dec, etc.   Here it using basically the same cores, but changes are made to better utilize those cores. I think this sentence summarize it the best:  ""Intel classifies Xe3 GPUs as part of the Battlemage family because the capabilities the chip presents to software are similar to those of existing Xe2 products"".  Now I'm not saying it's a bad thing, Intel has a lot of inefficiencies with Battlemage, a lot of time you expect it perform better judging by the amount of hardware. By going this route the basically giving pretty good improvement only year after initial release with basically almost the same drivers. It's just not a new generation but something in the middle between a refresh and a new generation.",Neutral
Intel,"Not rare, but more like it only happens when there's a paradigm shift in graphics that necessitates it.   GCN -> RDNA or Pascal -> Ampere are the most recent ones.",Neutral
Intel,"its not extremely rare. It happens once every 7-10 years or so when they redesign it for significant changes. but yeah, most generations will be refinement.",Neutral
Intel,"In the end it is all matter of marketing, filter it for a moment and understand what it's. As he said ""leverage all the good work from battlemage"". As I read it and looking the architecture it's battlemage with some enhancement that will come to future product celestial. Something like RDNA 3.5. I think they messed up the naming - they want to present it as something new and different (it's in some aspects) but it's not the real next gen in their roadmap.",Neutral
Intel,By discrete iam assuming you mean client graphics SoCs? The margins are not enough on those - you make much more money on Pro cards/ HPC.,Neutral
Intel,"No this is not the case. The decision is purely branding. Xe3 and Xe3P are part of the same generation architecture wise unlike Xe2 and Battlemage, he addressed this.",Neutral
Intel,It's this. IGPU's will be for gamers and DGPU for data center. They basically both have said this :) People just don't notice anything. What do folks think RTX IGPU's on intel chips are gonna be for. LIKE LOL!,Neutral
Intel,"Then why he said ""when we move to our next architecture...""? Meaning they are not the same (Xe3 and Xe3P), also look at the slide they're grouping Xe2 with Xe3 under battlemage.  What you say contradicts their statements, and the article. The decision is of course marketing but nowhere they say Xe3 and Xe3P share the same architecture. This is why I said before it should've been called Xe2.5 or something of that sort like with RDNA 3.5.",Neutral
Intel,Next architecture is just rearrangement of existing cores into more effective set up. No contradictions.,Neutral
Intel,"When we will see deep dive into X3P celestial we will see what have changed. Until then it's just speculation of the differences between Xe3 and Xe3P. My bet there will be more changes than mere ""rearrangement of existing cores"".",Neutral
Intel,"Love a good TAP interview, hopefully he'll do some podcasts too once the embargo lifts.",Positive
Intel,"I like how TAP said ""expect even bigger investments in graphics in the future"". I hope this means what I think it means, because Intel \*must\* continue heavy investment in their own graphics. Accelerated compute is the future.",Positive
Intel,MLID must have an aneurysm seeing the guy still employed at Intel,Neutral
Intel,"Tom's an absolute gem. It's so frustrating to see the most passionate and effective communicators locked up behind embargoes and NDAs, so fingers crossed that this marks the next wave of tech exploration and deep dives. Always nice to see him pop up in a random GN or PC World video.  Credit where it's due, Lex (Alejandro) has also always been attentive and forthcoming in his Reddit interactions, even factoring in the usual embargo/NDA constraints. Hopefully he'll dust off his u/LexHoyos42 account; I'd love to see some mini-AMAs as Panther Lake trickles out.",Positive
Intel,Igpus not discrete gpus,Neutral
Intel,"I would not attempt to read much into claims like that. This is marketing, not an investment roadmap. I'm sure if you pressed them on it, the lawyers would have some words.   Remember, they've yet to even *talk* about dGPUs past BMG. And the big-iGPU NVL is reportedly cancelled (likely in favor of the Nvidia partnership).",Negative
Intel,Hahaha I can hear Tom saying “fucking Tom Peterson has been *lying* to you” as you say that,Negative
Intel,Problem is we don't know the real roadmap is for Intel. I really want them to put out a roadmap like they used to. But things in flux probably :s.,Negative
Intel,I think only way for intel to enter consumer GPU space is to start via iGPU at this point.  They just need to make bigger faster iGPU to make Nvidia RTX xx50/RTX xx60 redundant.,Neutral
Intel,I don't think partnership Nvidia iGPUs will be ready until TTL/HML circa 2029/2030.,Neutral
Intel,"Agreed, but then similarly I would also not attempt to conjecture on their roadmap outside of an investment roadmap... lack of a public roadmap update on graphics in a while is certainly saying something by not saying anything, but it's also not saying cancellations, etc...",Negative
Intel,There are just too many Toms in tech media. Tom of Moore's Law is Dead needs to thin out the competition.,Negative
Intel,I don't think even Intel knows what the real roadmap is anymore. They're so far behind on the previous ones that it's not surprising that they're not releasing new ones.,Negative
Intel,We are not competing with higher end GPUs. It seems they want to capture the budget segment and then move up the ladder.  But I don't like that iGPUs has more priority than dGPUs. Hope celestial comes into life in future,Negative
Intel,"Probably, but no sense offering an in-house big iGPU for just one gen. It needs to be a long-term commitment.",Neutral
Intel,"I mean, the layoffs tell a story. The dGPU group, and client graphics SoC in general, was gutted even before Lip Bu came on. To say it's likely a skeleton crew is probably doing it a favor.",Neutral
Intel,You stole what I was going to say... take my upvote.,Neutral

Intel,"You think Intel is going to maintain these footholds any longer than they would need to?  This push of their dedicated GPUs into the professional space, is just a mere attempt to get rid of the unsold inventory of ARC-GPUs at the highest possible price-tag right from the beginning – Dumping those into the enterprise- and datacenter-space, in noble hope that someone clueless might bite upon the Intel-brand, and then dip into it at high costs *at non-existing support software-support* Intel pretends to deliver some time in the future.

Intel,"Even the fancy NVIDIA interconnects are a bottleneck for training performance, as are the memory bandwidth and even L2 bandwidth. One architects the algorithm around that. A tighter bottleneck is obviously not ideal, but it might still make sense depending on the price of the hardware.  As long as a copy of the full model and optimization state fits on the 24GB bank the PCI-E interconnect isn't really too limiting for training. Small models, like a 1B parameters voice model, will naturally fit. The larger the model you want to train, the more complex the architecture might be, but there are ways to train even models over 100B parameters on such hardware, like routing distributed fine grained experts. Not that I think it's a good idea at this point.",Neutral

Intel,"Intel buying chips from Nvidia won't be as cost efficient as them developing their own chips.

Intel,"The implication here is incredibly obvious:  ""Intel Arc B-Series consistes of Battlemage discrete graphics *and* PTL iGPUs"".  That's the implication here. It explicitly calls BMG dGPU cards ""discrete"" and does not do so for PTL",Neutral
Intel,Because it's most likely still the same foundation. Xe3 just have additional optimizations and HW blocks along the lines of OMM (confirmed) and whatever new tech Intel decides is worth pushing for higher end parts.    But perhaps it's more of a RDNA 3.5 situation. Some early Druid tech backported to XE3P.    Yeah I have zero clue just guessing xD,Neutral
Intel,"> It explicitly calls BMG dGPU cards ""discrete"" and does not do so for PTL  Of course not, since it would instantly tank their reputation and will kill all further ARC-sales?!  Do you actually think, that Intel is that stupid to plain announce the death of ARC-series graphics-cards? Do you think they'd even sell a hundreds cards after such a announcement? Who would by a dead-end line of graphics-cards, which won't even get any further driver-support and still have disastrous drivers like Intel's ARC? NO-ONE!  Of course they virtue signal it through the backdoor here, to preserve the sell-off the of the rest of pile of shame of their B-series graphics-cards as long as possible (leaving users with none support afterwards), and *only then* pull the plug afterwards when they went through their inventory …  Since when are you following Intel? Intel has always done so, and only announced a sudden discontinuation once the inventory was sold (leaving customers in the open with no further support overnight), despite virtue signalling a continuation all the time (to preserve a proper sell-off).  ---- Wasn't this exactly the same story with **Optane** back then? Each and every question upon a future support was answered in the affirmative, only to pull the plug overnight again as usual …  I'm not another piracy of cons here, it's Intel pulling the same Optane-stunt with ARC – Happily selling off their cards, knowing darn well, that they will pull the plug, yet refuse to actually play with open cards again.",Negative

Intel,I would imagine intel has to at least get celestial out the door before cutting off their GPU line. it's been so long in development that it would be more of a waste of money to cancel it then finish it and see how it sells. at least getting it to the public means some kind of ROI and a solid position in the lower end of the GPU market that AMD and Nvidia are abandoning to the used market.,Neutral

Intel,Lol if you believe that I have a bridge to sell you in Brooklyn,Neutral
Intel,"You have to look at this from both sides.  This would give NVidia the ability to offer OEMs a tightly integrated on SOC gfx solution vs a separate discrete gfx package as it is now. This would lower costs for NVidia's customers as well as improve performance and Intel's cpu's get to ride that train.   Intel has a long track record of using integrated gfx so it's certainly right up their alley to take this on.  Could Xe gfx coexist with NVidia? Yep, I think so.  Xe could be the budget igfx option and iNVidia is the premium integrated solution. That's basically how it is now with Intel Arc/Battlemage & GTX.   On the DC side, Intel has absolutely no gfx solution at this time and won't have anything for at least two years.  Intel already sells NVidia when a gfx solutions are needed so tighter integrated products will benefit both sides in that DC space as well.",Positive
Intel,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work. And even if NVIDIA wants to keep Intel's fabs open, I doubt they want to run them either.",Neutral

If you are referring to AIB Partners, then that can hardly be called an actual partnership. That's more of a contracted labor and distribution agreement.

Intel,"That really is up for debate. That they are losing money on them when you account for RNE and RnD amortized by unit, sure. That I have no doubt about.

We all know with RTX tech those Laptop CPUs will sell a whole lot more and make intel way more profit. Anything with Nvidia's tech sells like pancakes now.  So going forward they can't recover Xe development costs through the laptop iGPUs using like they did before. Remember laptop iGPUs are the highest volume ARC sales.

Even if they cancel their own CPU cores as a result of this deal, they can still use stock ARM cores in the future when/if the partnership ends...  But for Intel?

The CPU side isn't very efficient compared to Lunar Lake, and the GPUs sometimes don't work. But, when they do work, supposedly, the performance is really good, and, again, rumors, but the problem is supposedly more about Intel's drivers than the hardware or architecture itself.   ...I can completely believe that Intel would panic and would rather kill their GPU division entirely than. Invest in their software stack. Developing good technology and then abandoning it instead of advancing, because abandoning it is cheaper and easier is an extremely Intel move.

Intel,"I can see a consumer marketing reason and a business professional reason for RTX throughout: driver support. Anything with the RTX branding will get more support on both fronts, especially if the integrated parts default to studio level drivers.

Intel,"I think client inference is kind of stupid. It's limited in capability by your local memory amount, and it's economically inefficient because you can't batch requests.  No AI system that exists is ""there"" yet, all of them can be improved enough that people would switch over to a better one. The current top of the line commercial models are hundreds of GB for the weights. To use client inference today you need to use a severely castrated model. Alternatively, if you ship all those hundreds of GB of DRAM on every device, they will be very inefficiently utilized because a single user rarely has the token flow to keep them working, and when they do it's all serial so you can't even batch, you just have to do a linear read over the whole model to get a single token out. And when there's an improved model next year that takes twice the ram you have to roll out whole new machines to the whole fleet.  In contrast, centralized inference can fit as much memory as you put on it, there are no power constraints, you can batch hundreds of requests in one go, and you can update the whole system much more easily. Client inference won't even win in latency because even though you have to pay for network latency, the centralized solution is probably much faster.  The only real advantage client inference has is privacy, and that's not a problem in business, they just get their own inference server. For office work, that even makes latency very fast.",Negative

Intel,b580 should've allowed SR-IOV upon release. That's all the card really needs to sell.,Neutral
Intel,"Even at $599 it's significantly cheaper than a used 3090, comes with a full warranty, and can be bulk purchased new.  If you just need the VRAM, which is what this is targetting, I think it can definitely make sense.",Positive
Intel,"This is worth it at any price point.  I am getting tired of gamers not understanding that SR-IOV support and 200W are very important to some people. If there were a 24GB AMD card out there for 200W and $600 I would buy that too regardless of SR-IOV support.  Neither Nvidia nor AMD have a card at this price point with this feature set. You are looking at $600 for 24GB of VRAM and SR-IOV support. AMD's SR-IOV offerings are in the ""thousands of dollars"" and Nvidia's cards in this segment do not meet the 200W and 24GB of VRAM targets. The closest thing is the P40 and it's a decade old, has way higher power consumption and is about to be end of lifed.  Please tell me the card that exists in the same segment as the B60.

Intel,"It barely makes sense, at $600.  3090s are $700 now and the new 5070Ti Super (faster than a 3090) is expected to come out at $750 soon. And you’d have CUDA for either the Nvidia 3090 or 5070Ti Super.   I strongly believe that $600 is the price Intel set to ward off the scalpers. The niche of the B60 is pretty tiny at $600.

It wouldn't be great for marketing if Arc came out at the same time with similar pricing, yet got beaten in the FPS benchmarks.  But productivity cards could wait.

Intel,"It's a really good general purpose card. Perhaps not the best card if you want to squeeze out the most fps out of games, but it performs really well in a wide range of tasks including gaming. And yes 12GB VRAM really comes in handy.  It can easily be found for under $250. B580 is still cheaper than 5060 and 9060 XT and even RTX 5050 and RX 7600, especially in the UK where you can find a B570 for only 20 pounds more than RTX 3050. That's way cheaper than RX 6600, it's a no brainer. But the prices could only go down thanks to economy of scale mostly. It's been produced for a while, that's why.  Also one of the big reasons it's still selling now is thanks to good publicity. Imagine if it came out as the same time as RX 9060 XT. HWU would tear a new hole regardless of how much of an improvement it is over the Alchemist cards and the impressive productivity performance.

AutoDesk for example will tell you to go pound sand if you try to get support and you aren't running a workstation GPU with ECC VRAM. So for businesses running AutoDesk software in a professional capacity, or businesses needing SR-IOV, you could offer them a 3090 or a 5070 Ti Super to them for $100 and it still won't be an option for them, because for their needs they might as well be paperweights.",Negative

Intel,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction. Very important when running 24-48 hour simulations.",Neutral

I believe VDI is Microsoft's implementation. I believe I've done VDI on my RTX 2070 before (I have done seamless sharing between host and VM), but I don't know if it's possible with AMD. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm more familiar with the Linux side / vGPU than VDI.  ECC is Error Correcting RAM. I generally don't understand the use case for ECC either, but it is ubiquitous in HPC. All server boards support ECC RAM.  In modern environments most of these features need 16GB of VRAM minimum, but if you ever wanted to try it on a consumer card, you could get an old RTX 20 series and try it out with some driver mods.

Networking, it depends on whether the protocols you use have more error checks at a higher level (TCP does; UDP does not).

If all you care for is VDI for a small number of VMs, then you'd go GPU passthrough. vGPU / MxGPU often requires higher levels of hypervisor software tier (i.e. VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus), requiring more money. For KVM hosts, setting up vGPU is a lot more difficult and time consuming than just straight up GPU passthrough.  Only two groups of people would be interested in GPU virtualization / splitting:  * Enterprise, in which they wouldn't care about the used card prices.  * Enthusiasts, in which they wouldn't want to pay for vGPU prices anyway.

Intel,"Full GPU passthrough is not a solution that many people would consider because it is clumsier than using sr-iov (or potentially VirtIO GPU Venus). Plus for each extra passthrough instance I would have to add in another GPU and this greatly increases power consumption, heat output and cooling requirements. The process is not all that much more complicated at least on Turing GPUs with a hacked driver on KVM guests at least. Plus for passthrough, you probably still need an NVIDIA card because last I checked AMD cards still had a random kernel panic issue after being passed through.  My assumption is that sr-iov on the b50 will allow users an affordable way to have multiple guests on one host GPU without increasing power draw and paying for expensive alternatives and expensive vGPU subscriptions.",Negative

I'm sure setting up mdev devices in KVM, finding the correct corresponding GPU instances, making them persistent through reboot, then edit virsh xml for each individual VM is a lot easier than just doing IOMMU passthrough. /s     Again, enthusiasts don't care about power consumption / heat output / cooling requirements for their lab environment.

Intel,"The E core having more improvements than just 50% larger L2 is a nice surprise, but damn the efficiency and performance of it is insane. 29% and 22% more performance, at the same power draw is insane, clocking like 6.7% higher too. They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown. As that can probably handle like another extra watt of heat and performance. Battery life is very nice, the fact that it can match other phones with like over 1000mAh bigger battery is funny. As people always flexing over how they have like a 4000, 5000mAh+ battery, of course having a bigger capacity is better, but the fact that Apple is more efficient with it and can have the same battery life at a much smaller battery speaks volumes about it.",Positive
Intel,"The occupancy characteristics of A19 Pro are quite incredible. 67% occupancy for a RT workload.  Look at Chips and cheese's SER testing. 36-44% ray occupancy with SER in Cyberpunk 2077 RT Overdrive.     Assuming NVIDIA can get this working on 60 series an effective a 52-86% uplift. After OMM and SER this seems like the third ""low hanging"" RT fruit optimization. Anyone serious about a PT GPU architecture NEEDs dynamic caching like Apple.

Intel,"Nice been waiting for this. P-core frontend improvements and branch, and a wider E-core with it's newer memory subsystem shows great YoY gains as usual. Though I am not surprised since it's been years leading up to this that Apple has steadily have been increasing power/freq to get the rest of it's performance gains, although IPC YoY is still class leading. The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that. The base iPhone 17 looks like a reaaly reallly good option, more than ever, wished they didn't drop the Plus model. But man, I feel like waiting another year, hearing rumours about N2 and new packaging tech excites me.  That said, looking forward to QC, MT, and Samsung.

Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade.

Intel,"Geekerwan's results are ***average*** power, not peak power, IIRC. These are real, actual frequency bins that Apple has allowed.  These frequency bins *will* be hit by some workloads, but just not nearly as long as SPEC & active cooling will allow. It would be good to revisit Apple's boosting algorithms, but IIRC, they hit 100% of Apple's design frequency in normal usage.  It's not like users have a choice here; we can't say, ""Please throttle my A19 Pro to the same power draw as the A18 Pro."" Low power mode neuters much of the phone, so it's rarely used all the time.  //  I find avgerage power useful two reasons:  1. *How* performance vs power were balanced; here, performance took precedence while not keeping power stable.  2. It also shows, when nodes are not the same, where the node's improvements went. Here, an N3P core delivers notably worse perf / W versus an N3E core. TSMC claims [up to 5% to 10% less power](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmcs-3nm-update-n3p-in-production-n3x-on-track) on N3P vs N3E.  I agree 10W is not common and SPEC is a severe test, but it's more the *pattern* that has emerged on Apple's fp power and whether it's worth it:  2023 - A17 Pro P-Core: 6.40W  2025 - A19 Pro P-Core: 10.07W  Apple has leaped +**57%** average fp power in two years. Seems like not a good compromise when you're eating more power per unit of performance.   That is, the A19 Pro on fp has skewed towards the flatter part of the perf / W curve.   >And I really doubt you'll be seeing 10W of ST power consumption on a phone. Geekerwan tests these things using Liquid Nitrogen. They are to test an SoC without restraints.  I agree it's rare, but why would Apple allow 10W? Were many workloads ***lacking*** fp performance that users prefer a bit less battery life for +9% fp perf vs the A18 Pro?  Of course, to most, battery life is more important, IMO, which is why core energy is most crucial, but missing here.  //  >An A19 Pro P core does seem to have increased performance at the same power by about 5%. Only P/W at peak has reduced. Which isn't even an issue when these phones would never reach that peak in daily use.  So the question becomes: do users want slightly better perf and 5% more power?

Intel,"the shader re-ordering is different. (apple also do this).  Even with shader re-ordering you have the issue that you're still issuing 1000s of very small jobs.    GPUs cant do lots of small jobs, they are designed to do the same task to 1000s of pixels all at once.     If  you instead give them 1000 tasks were each pixel does something differnt the GPU cant run that all at the same time... in addition the overhead for setup and teardown of each of these adds even more void space between them.   So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",Neutral
Intel,"While RT does have lots of branching logic (and CPUs are much better at dealign with this) you also want to shader the result when a ray intercepts, and this is stuff GPUs are rather good at (if enough rays hit that martial)   We have had CPU RT for a long time and so long as you constrain the martial space a little GPUs these days, even with all the efficiency  loss are still better at it.   (there are still high end films that opt for final render on cpu as it gives them more flexibility in the shaders they use) but for a game were it is all about fudging it GPUs are orders of magnitude faster, you just have so much more fp compute throughput on the GPU even if it is running at 20% utilization that is still way faster than any cpu.",Positive

AMD certainly has some power issues, but many of which, i.e. inefficient I/O dies, are not really dependent on the CPU uArch and could switch at any moment. They certainly have much more inefficient chips at the moment than both Apple and Qualcomm. For Zen 6 we expect a major update to the desktop chiplet architectur which could bring some much needed improvements in terms of I/O though.  They have reasonably fast cores, and I think they are not in a terrible position, even though it is far from good. I think what is interesting for AMD to look out for is that they keep moving fast, instead of intel who didnt move fast since like 14nm, and AMD has strong cores. Additionally AMD has (including from the datacenter) an enterprise need to make the CPUs more efficient.  So yeah, very bad CPUs efficiency wise. A bit behind, but not terribly on perf per node wise, efficiency on the desktop is an afterthought for AMD, clearly, but they are moving constantly and are improving.

TSMC claimed 25-30% power savings from N7 to N5 and another 30-35% from N5 to N3.  Using these numbers, we get these 4 E-cores using somewhere around 6-7w PEAK, but this is all-core turbo. Intel's CPU at it's most efficient 12w configuration won't hit it's 4.4GHz turbo required to win in single-core performance and is going to hit closer to its 1.2GHz base clock in all-core sustained performance at which point the E-cores not only have their giant IPC advantage, but double the clockspeed too.  All this again to make the point that a macbook with this will be blazing fast for consumer workloads and might finally be the laptop to usher in multi-day battery life.",Neutral

Intel,"Reordering of shaders has a cost, if for a given martial you just hit 10 rays you will not want to dispatch that shader with just 10 instances as the cost of dispatch and scdulaing will be higher than just inlining the evaluation, so you will merge together the low frequency hits into a single wave were you then use branching/fuction point calls.    You will also use this mixed martial uber shader to use up all the dregs that do not fit within a SMD group.      Eg you might have 104 rays hit a martial but that martial shader can only fit 96 threads into a SIMD group so has 8 remaining thread, you don't want to just dispatch these on there own as that will have very poor occupancy (with 88 threads worth of compute ideal) so you instead inline them within a uber shader along with a load of other overflow.",Neutral

Intel,"But we were discussing CPU uArches, and on the question of ""Does AMDs single core suck up 31W"" the answer is ""NO"", the SoC power is 31W, and that is an issue that can be solved independently of the CPU uArch.  This just means that the massive inefficiencies are not inherint to the CPU uArch, but are a Problem of SoC design.  7W on a single core isnt super efficient, but its far lower than 20-31W. The question is if AMD is able to strip away a large part of those ~20W overhead, but that is not contingent on questions about CPU uArches.  And thats the point of the 1 Core vs 2 Core comparison. To demonstrate that it isnt the CPU that sucks up 20W, but the SoC, which can be solved much differently.",Negative

Intel,"At these small die sizes, yields can be really high. High enough that if they wanted to have supply for a 5050, they might not have enough GB206 dies that can be cut down to 20/36 SMs.  The 5060M is probably catching the bulk of the bottom-level GB206 dies at 26/36.  There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory. And I'd agree. But I'm sadly not anybody who can make that decision.  Personally, I can't wait to see what becomes of the cut-down GB207s. The 5050 is a ""golden"" fully-enabled die.

You can find those numbers on Gamer's nexus latest shrinkflation video on this topic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caU0RG0mNHg). Considering those things, the 5060 is essentially a 5050 and the 5050 is a 5030.  The GT 730 had 13.3% as many cores as the full GK110 die, with a 50W TDP.  The GT 1030 had around 10.3% as many cores as the full GP102 die, with a 30W TDP though this one was impressive.  The GXT 1630 had around 11% as many cores as full TU102 die, with exactly 75W TDP.  The RTX 5050 has 10.7% as many cores as the full GB202 die (RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell), and around 11.7% vs the 5090 (which is the number you'll se on Gamer's Nexus video, he rounds it up to 12%, I think that was a mistake on his part? I'm not gonna try and correct him though), but it has a TDP of 130W somehow, just 15W less than the 5060, that's absurd.  Hence why I'm saying it SHOULD be a sub 75W TDP card, and priced way below that.

Intel,"Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍 Doesn't matter if die sizes get bigger, that's up to Nvidia. Just because the halo product got bigger doesn't mean they can get away with moving their product stack (below the XX90) one tier up in prices.   I guess it is a dog shit methodology to use, only Gamer's Nexus uses it and I'm sure #1 Nvidia apologist u/Alive_Worth_2032 knows more than him.   It's a shit methodology to use if you love conformism and shrinkflation in GPUs, I agree.  And it's a shit methodology to use if you're an Nvidia executive.  If you can't see that Nvidia is putting all the effort into binning high end chips for AI cause it's 90% of their income, then I don't know what to tell you. Obviously it's a good move for them, and it works, but there's 0 reason for a gaming customer to defend them for it. We used to get much more out of their chips in the gaming cards for more reasonable prices, why's it wrong to want that?   You can't just draw a conclusion based on relative performance between 2 underpowered products, you compare them to the ""best"" Nvidia COULD give us (which is the full top die for each generation) and go down from there.  Edit: just look at the 3090/ti and how the chips were proportionally fine still compared to it and that die was 628mm^2. That's not even an excuse.",Neutral
Intel,"> It's a shit methodology to use if you love conformism and shrinkflation in GPUs, I agree. And it's a shit methodology to use if you're an Nvidia executive.  You can chose one methodology.   You can decide on comparing what hardware you get at a certain price point.   Or you can ignore price/bom and look only at arbitrary model numbers as if they mean something.  You cannot do both at the same time.  Personally I prefer to look at die area. The 5050 today is roughly comparable to the 1050 Ti, comparing it to the top cards that are not comparable is irrelevant.  Pascal did not have a analogue for the 5090, period.  >Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍  That changes nothing. The Pascal Titan are using the same die as the 1080 Ti. The whole tier of die that is used in today's consumer top SKUs and for the RTX 6000 Blackwell, DID NOT EXIST back then.  >Edit: just look at the 3090/ti and how the chips were proportionally fine still compared to it and that die was 628mm2. That's not even an excuse.  What are you even trying to say? Ampere also did not have a analogue to the 5090. The 3090 Ti, even it is sitting almost a tier below the 5090. The 2080 Ti and 5090 are unmatched in other generations.",Negative
Intel,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear. What I don't agree with is using the die area excuse to justify shrinkflation just because the 5090 is such a halo product.",Neutral
Intel,"> So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  Do you even listen to your own madness?  You realize that what you are saying. Is that the lower end 5000 series would be ""better"". If Nvidia removed the 5090 entirely. And renamed the 5080 the 5080 Ti, and made the 5070 Ti into the new 5080.  Suddenly, you would praise the lower end cards for being ""better"". Purely because the high end is less powerful. Nothing else changed, no one is getting more hardware for their money.  Jesus Christ the mental gymnastics you people go trough.   The hardware Nvidia gives you for your money, is all that matters. How large the top die is and what core configuration it has. Is irrelevant for the value for cards further down the stack.",Neutral
Intel,"They should work fine together. They did have some issues with overhead with lower end CPUs previously, but that got fixed. I haven't heard about the ReBAR issue specifically, though.",Neutral
Intel,"The only thing I would look into. Is the 9060XT 16GB. Depending on your region, it may only be an additional 100 euro or so. Other than that, this is a solid build. Also, I'm not sure how Intel drivers are with Linux. Someone else may be able to comment on that.",Neutral
Intel,"I'd pick up the 7600x and get a separate air cooler. Stock coolers are terrible, and you should be able to get a pretty decent one for 20-30€.",Negative
Intel,"These parts are very solid and I think that you'll be very happy with the performance! Especially if you plan on everyday computing with some light gaming/production work.  The only recommendation I would make is to add an aftermarket cooler that performs better than the stock cooler. Nothing wrong with the stock cooler though. I have the stock cooler of a 3900X on my Plex server and it definitely gets the job done with no concern! :)  If you would like to consider an aftermarket cooler, the [Thermalright Peerless Assassin](https://www.amazon.com/Thermalright-Peerless-Assassin-120-Cooler/dp/B09LGY38L4?th=1) has incredible performance at a great price.  Regarding your fan question, that's ultimately up to you. Some people want maximum airflow, some people can't stand the noise that can come with a tower full of fans spinning, some people don't care either way. But yeah, I would recommend 2 fans in the front for intake and one for exhaust. Which I guess is the default configuration. It's a solid little case, but fan options are real limited.",Positive
Intel,"Thanks for the advice!  I checked out the ASRock Challenger Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB. It needs a PCI.E 5.0 slot, or am I reading that wrong? I believe me motherboard only supports up to PCI.E 4.0.   I will check whether I can upgrade the motherboard",Neutral
Intel,Added it! Thanks!,Positive
Intel,"Don't need PCIe 5. It just supports it, which is kind of useless at the moment for gamers. More so people who are going to be running local AI on their machines.",Negative
Intel,"PCI-E 5 is backwards compatible with 4, 4 is compatible with 3, etc. If you run a PCI-E 5 card in a PCI-E 4 slot, you'll just have slightly reduced performance, if any reduction at all. Most GPU's never completely utilize the power available within the slot. Check out some of the benchmark videos comparing the performance difference when gaming.",Neutral
Intel,I have changed the GPU! Thank you for your advice!,Positive
Intel,"Yes, its viable but 110$ sounds a bit much",Neutral
Intel,"My kids have 10400 with a 1660 super. Runs great, although nothing heavier than Genshin Impact and Minecraft.",Positive
Intel,All the other comments are correct but i wanna ask. How old is that monitor? You can probably get a used 1080p one for pretty cheap,Neutral
Intel,They had a 6500XT on Woot for like 80$,Neutral
Intel,Ripoff for $110,Neutral
Intel,its better than what you have and for 50 you can't go wrong really...,Positive
Intel,"$50 is fine, make the trade, saves you headache. AMD has dropped game optimization support for 5000 and 6000 series Radeon cards. 1660 super came out same time as the 5000 series and NVIDIA is keeping support up for now.",Neutral
Intel,I mean it is more than double your current performance with more vram but the rx 5700xt can be commonly had for around 100$ used and is almost 50% faster than the 1660 super and with 8gb of vram instead. Although at 720p it might be overkill for your use case given the CPU you have. Not a bad deal at 50$ tbh especially since the gtx 1050 is basically worthless at this point.,Positive
Intel,"That's a bit much for a 1660s, most 10 series 50, 60 and 70 rang cards aren't expensive now. But I would look for RTX2060, where I live used ones start from 90-100euro. At 720p it will be a much better boost, plus DLSS4",Neutral
Intel,"I ran a 10400F + 1660 Super until a few months ago. It was struggling with UE5 games so much that I just got a new PC outright.  In any case, the lowest-end GPU I'd recommend in 2025 is an RX 6600 XT or an RTX 2060 Super. Anything less and you're basically settling for playing only old games.  ALSO VERY IMPORTANT: That 720p monitor (768p I assume) most likely DOES NOT have a digital input like HDMI or DisplayPort. The 1660 Super ONLY has digital outputs, maybe DVI on certain models. Make sure that the GPU and Monitor are compatible, because I sure didn't account for that back in 2019 when I got an RX 570, and had to ALSO spend money on a 1080p monitor with HDMI support instead of keeping my old 1366x768 VGA monitor.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes as long as you are 1080p gaming and do not expect to run the absolute newest and most demanding games of the past couple years. I’ve been using a gtx 1660ti since 2021 and I love it. It also overclocks to the moon perfectly stable. I’ve got +150 on the core, +1300 on the memory at 110% power limit. It will happily go higher, but I stopped there as I wanted the temp under load to stay under 75c.  Edit: that overclock worked out to about 10% more fps in games for me  Also, not sure if your 1050ti requires a power connector but the 1660s does so make sure you have one. Your power supply should be fine though, as that card usually draws 100w at most.",Positive
Intel,My 1660 super still feels good enough with today's games. Other than Indiana Jones. All other games run well enough for me. Busy with ARC Raiders and BF6 at the moment.,Positive
Intel,"16 series is fantastic for last gen, mostly useless for current gen.  But its much much more balanced in line with your CPU than a 1050ti is and that trade seems like a fine deal as long as everything works",Positive
Intel,"Honestly I was using a 1660 and a 1080 for way longer than I should have but it runs like all games on really really decent settings as long as you aren't playing modern AAA games. If you've got the extra money, a newer card is better of course though",Positive
Intel,"It depends on what you're expecting. It'll run most games. RT only games won't run. It's a decent card and my older brother still uses it in his build for some racing games and shooters. But if you're looking to play all the latest games like indiana jones and doom the dark ages, I'd save a bit more money and get something newer with more vram.",Neutral
Intel,"It's not.  At the very least I would get the 2060. It's only 20% more performance in raster, but, crucially, it can run DLSS - which is gonna be another 20-30% more performance, even at that resolution.",Neutral
Intel,If you're curious about how much more performance you'll be getting compared to your old 1050ti check out this video. It's a straight really good upgrade for you at $50. You'd probably be able to play at 1080p at a mostly stable 60fps depending on the game and settings. Especially older games no problem.  https://youtu.be/N8i-neXsMH8  It's perfectly viable. Contrary to what a lot of people say you don't have to always have the newest and best tech if your expectations aren't sky high. And it's still a far better deal for you at the moment than buying an entire new PC.  And here's a 1660 super running Arc Raiders. It runs amazing for how well the game looks.  https://youtu.be/h_31FmStPuY,Positive
Intel,Decent card for 1080p gaming in older last gen games. It's too slow for modern releases.,Negative
Intel,It will be a good boost in performance for 50$.,Positive
Intel,50$ if i exchange my gtx 1050ti,Neutral
Intel,i wasnt buying a new monitor cuz my 1050ti will not support the high res.. my games will lag more than it lags now.. after getting a new gpu i will upgrade my monitor.. been using my AOC monitor since 2010.,Negative

Intel,"for 50, a 1660 super is excellent value, so I'd say go for it.",Neutral
Intel,"I feel you, my 1050ti stopped pulling new games at 1080p. Ended up playing KCD at 720p in the end",Negative
Intel,"Still, it's easier on the eyes and it's nice for Media consumption as well but if you are satisfied it doesn't matter",Positive
Intel,"Well they just shot themselves in the foot with dropping gaming optimization support, no matter how rabid their fans become. I can't wait though, gonna low-ball the hell out of FBM posts and get some secondary cards for Lossless Scaling.",Negative

Intel,ok will finish the deal then.,Neutral
Intel,I stopped using my GTX 760 which is pretty much the same performance as 1050 TI in  2020 I was getting 30 fps most games  idk how you made it 5 more years lol,Negative
Intel,How is that viable I just bought a almost brand new 3050 for 140,Neutral
Intel,"Bro I wouldn't pay that and, however trading your old GPU and $50 isn't bad because realistically your gonna get -20-30 tops. And you can find 1660 supers on marketplace all day for 100 or less",Negative
Intel,"Don't expect much a performance difference.... yeah its better, but it still wont handle even slightly modern titles very well. You'd be much better off saving up a little bit more money and find9ng something newer.",Negative
Intel,"Sheer willpower, I've not played too many games I wanted, earliest being RDR2. I actually wanted to get a new GPU just when miners peaked, then 'Rona happened, then I hit financial low. Used market was also horrid. Only with 40 series and now 50 series am I able to buy a GPU. Last year I almost rage bought a 4060 lol Now I'm aiming for a 5070",Negative
Intel,"Viable because the RTX 3050 is an absolute shit deal of a card. It’s slightly lower than a 1660 Super on average. Its only upsides are DLSS, Frame Gen, and longer driver support.  For $50, the 1660 Super is a steal, and OP is able to get rid of their old GPU in the process too. It’s two birds with one stone.",Negative
Intel,6GB or 8GB?  The 1660 Super is better than a 3050 6GB anyways.,Positive
Intel,"I went from a 1050ti to a 1660 super a few years ago. And it gave me plenty of extra performance. My wife still uses that card to game at 1080p, and she has had no complaints so far. You just have to be ready to lower your settings.  Biggest downside is the lack of dlss.",Positive
Intel,What does she play?,Neutral
Intel,"When she first build the pc she played a lot of Hogwarts legacy. Which ran great. She also plays satisfactory.  I also used it to play games like Cyberpunk, HZD and Metro Exodus on (I think) at least medium. And I used a 1440p monitor.  I know a 1660 super is far from the newest or best cars. But it still performs ok in most modern titles as long as you dont expect to much and lower the settings. And I think for 50, it can be a decent deal.",Positive
Intel,"Try it. Some of the older games are probably fine, newer probably not.  In any case a dedicated gaming desktop PC would definitely be a much better experience. But you don’t have to go crazy. Around $1200 is the sweet spot IMO. Check the sidebar for resources and guides.",Positive
Intel,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ptRLMB4m2I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ptRLMB4m2I) he tested your exact CPU & iGPU and overall it looks playable depends on what your standard of playable means (with 1080p, around 40fps, no 60fps unfortunately). Most of the games you mentioned has upscaling tech like FSR/XESS that you can use in the graphic settings of each game to further improve the performance (basically playing the game in less than 1080p then upscale it to 1080p).     But if what you want is a 1080p stable 60fps for now and for the future, you definitely need something more than what you have right now. 1080p 60fps is easy to achieve with less than 700USD budget. Even more lower if you are confident in buying used parts",Neutral
Intel,"If you’re hesitant about buying games in case they don’t run well, you could always do a month of Xbox Game Pass and use any games on there to benchmark.",Neutral
Intel,"I say build the PC, as a Gen Xer who hadn't touched PC gaming in 20 years I just built a gaming PC.  Had a blast doing it.  Just grab an awesome case and a mid tier GPU for starters.  I bought a Radeon 6800 XT GPU off of a friend and started from there.  My setup isn't top tier but it games incredibly.  Indiana Jones and Ghosts of Tsushima look fantastic.",Positive
Intel,We don't know your exact situation; actually test the games.,Neutral
Intel,"You might be able to play a couple of titles with the the specs you listed (call of duty world at war for example, maybe some older resident evil games) but it would be cutting it close and it would be low/medium settings",Neutral
Intel,"Most single player games are likely to be playable   I'd say install Steam and buy a few - you download them.. . but keep them in a steam account that you can use again on a new computer   So you kinda buy to keep  GOG is another store you can buy games in.. . and is probably a better option for things like ""The Witcher 3""",Neutral
Intel,"Treat yourself to the PC, you’ve earned it!",Neutral
Intel,"Intel arc on the laptop runs older games pretty decently. Check the youtube link below for list of games.

If you take this route, just make sure that youre paying the correct price fot the parts youre getting. Often times you will see pre-built pcs, or shops scamming their customers by selling them ancient hardware for the same price as a new pc.",Positive
Intel,"since you said you have enough money to get a PC, do that, treat yourself with a decent setup, it would be a million times better than playing on a laptop, especially the games you mentioned, if you can share your budget im sure we can figure out a good PC for those games, you won't need anything crazy i promise haha, all mid range pc combinations are able to run all those very well",Positive
Intel,"When it comes to pc game, there are so many variables.  Graphics setting, resolution, upscaling, genre of game and perceived smoothness of different FPS all contribute to how well a game run for you.  It is really hard to tell without trying.    For an integrated gpu, yours is by no means weak, but it still cannot compare to modern discrete gpu.  Generally, anything in or before ps4 era(i.e released before 2020 ) should run fine with minimum graphics setting at 1080p with fsr / xess upscaling. It should safely run at 30fps or above (i.e. as smooth or smoother than ps4 game)  Anything newer you will have to either watch benchmark on youtube, try the demo or benchmark tool of the game(some games offer this).  Steam also support refund of games played in less than 2 hours and purchased less than 2 weeks.  But don’t do that too much or you will be denied the refund.",Neutral
Intel,Those are pretty good specs for a laptop i would think it would be fine but i only play on desktop. Laptop components arent as good because its harder to keep them cool,Positive
Intel,"I think personally you should build a pc! As long as your budget allows it you can get something for around 600 bucks on facebook marketplace, or you can build with used parts off of facebook marketplace.   If you want recommendations I’ll give you some:  Ryzen 5 5900x (180ish used)  RX6700xt (200ish bucks used)  Asus b450-f motherboard (50 - 100 bucks used)  32gb ddr4 ram whatever you’d like, probably Corsair though. (80-100ish)  PSU 650W (something reputable like Corsair) (90 bucks)  You can find good air coolers for the cpu for under 50 bucks just do research.   You’re looking at 680 bucks on the high end but definitely can find parts to fit a cheaper budget. Feel free to message me and I’d be glad to help you find something.  Edit: this is what you should expect as far as performance, you should expect with these exact specs to be able to play currently all games on high settings, competitive or first person shooters tend to run better than single player games in my experience, I’d expect 120+ frames on 1080p, or even higher than that if you drop your settings. As far as single player games, you should be able to max out most games and get a solid 60fps which is fine for single player.",Positive

Intel,"The nice thing about building a desktop, is that you can upgrade it over time.  Cpu, motherboard and ram need to be bought together, but a decent power supply can last for years as can your case and monitor. I'm an old guy who has been building PCs for myself and kids for around 20 years.   Get a mid tower case with good air flow and a quality PSU.  I'd look at website recommendations for the best bang for your buck AMD BUILD for your cpu and motherboard recommendations , get 2 sticks of 16 gig ram., a 1 tb M2 ssd as a system drive, and dump the rest into the GPU.   27 inch monitors are fairly cheap now, and you can get whatever keyboard and mouse you want.",Positive

As a result, since you aren't on AM4 already, unless you're getting a killer deal on a used 5700X3D/5800X3D, recommend you go with 9600X + B850 + usual 32 GB 6000 CL30 kit.

That's going to be the best bang for your buck.    However, i don't see the AM5 parts that much more expensive. Obviously, if you're looking at 9950x3D etc then you're paying a lot. But you could get a Ryzen 5 7600/7600X/9600X that'll perform better than your 7700K for pretty cheap and a B650 board for a good price. The only spanner in the works is the price of RAM.

Intel,"Am5 any day. The price gap even for used am4 to am5 is so small, that am5 makes so much more sense. The am4 x3d are hugely overpriced, even used. A ryzen 7600x is already equal in performance to a 5700x3d (thats like 5% slower then a 5800x3d). You pay maybe 80€ more for going AM5 but have a much better outlook for an upgrade in some years. There were some edge cases were i would have recommended going am4 used (like 16 cores or a lot of cheap ram), but with ram prices skyrocketing, thats not really an option anymore. I would go am4 if you do a really budget gaming build like with a r5 3600, or you get a REALLY good deal on a am4 prebuilt. Am5 will have a much longer lifespan, with cpu upgrades coming and reusing ddr5....",Neutral
Intel,I wouldn't buy new and get am4 that's for sure. Since your upgrading peice by peice you should get the best CPU you can afford. Get a 7600X or 9600x on AM5 and you might even get a second CPU upgrade out of it.  AM4  might not even be fast enough for an 9060,Neutral
Intel,"AM5, a 7600x more or less is the same as a 5700x3d except in instances when the L3 cache matters and it's 1% lows but 7600x 1% aren't even that bad.",Neutral
Intel,"Hmmmmm  Am5 , because you have better upgrade potential later. 9600x or 9700x.   Intel option , if you can get a cheap used 12400 or 12700k then maybe go for those.  Even 13th gen 13400 will beat your 7700k.",Positive
Intel,Am5 no question,Neutral
Intel,"Brother! I just upgraded from a 7700 and 1070 myself. Served me well for 8 years lol.   I went with a b850/9600x/9060xt and it is badass. You can sometimes save a little with a 7600x as it is only maybe 5% slower and a bit hotter. Went from 30ish fps in helldivers on low settings to 80+fps native, and 120-200 with fsr frame gen stuff turned on. It is a night and day difference vs my old unit... but its 4 generations of hardware newer so of course it is.   In my area for $280us they have a b650/7600x cpu combo with a free aio water cooler on Newegg. Killer deal.   5800x3d is great if you can find one. The 7800x3d is around $360us just for the chip new and actually available. Used 5800x3ds go for 350+ on ebay... not sure why people wouldnt just buy the better chip new for the same price... i guess they dont want to update an old motherboard.",Positive
Intel,Def AM5 if you don't have an AM4 Plattform right now,Neutral
Intel,"It's a false economy to buy in to am4 at this point, go am5.",Negative
Intel,"If you are spending the money, you should go with the current socket system.  7800x3d is a good target",Positive
Intel,"If it's just performance as the i7 you can get AM4 non-x3d or LGA 1700 and still maybe get a gpu upgrade with whats left. If you were considering x3d chances are you'll spend roughly the same for entry-level am5.   You don't really need anything fancy like a 9600x and B850, get a 7500f + b650 and it'll still be a huge upgrade. Even 16gb ram would be alright.",Neutral
Intel,9600x+B850 board.   B650 boards are on end of life. Production stoped and updates soon also.  Go B850 for future path to upgrades following Zen6 and maybe Zen7,Neutral
Intel,Unless you have an AM4 board and the DDR4 RAM already you should go AM5.  AM4 is just not worth it anymore with the scarcity of x3d CPUs and DDR4 RAM prices climbing.  The budget nature of AM4 is pretty much done.,Negative
Intel,"Jump to am5. You’re not already on am4, you have to buy a new motherboard for that, though you can re use memory. But the 7600/9600 areas fast as the 5800x3D and a lot cheaper.",Neutral
Intel,"Entirely depends on what your new vs used pricings are locally. I would not even consider any AM4 X3D rigs here, they cost more than a new set of B650+7500F+32GB RAM.",Neutral
Intel,5800x3D is pointless for new builders as it's insanely priced just go AM5 and grab a 7600x/9600x,Neutral
Intel,You're not going to find a 5800x3d at a decent price unless you have some friend who's still holding onto AM4 for some reason.,Negative
Intel,"Do you have DDR4 RAM already? Then AM4 should be fine. The cost of RAM is soaring right now, so either buy RAM immediately or just stick to 5800x3d. It'll be great for years to come, and then just upgrade to AM6.   I would have recommended AM6, just as most will, but that was before the leaping RAM prices.",Positive
Intel,"5800X3D & 5700X3D are out of production and thus, the prices are only getting higher. Including used prices.   Just a quick search on ebay and sold listings are showing an average of $300-350, with some at $400 or more as a bundle with motherboard and RAM.   For not much more money, at around $550, you can get a 9600X, a B850 motherboard and 32GB of DDR5.   If RAM prices weren't skyrocketing like they currently are, you could have gotten a basic AM5 setup for around $450 a few weeks ago. Some of the price hike can be explained by RAM chips being purchased for AI, due to many many data centers popping up all over major cities. But also can be explained by the upcoming holiday season in a few short weeks. Its a common trend now - you can use a price tracker like CamelCamelCamel or PCPartpicker to look at the pricing trend.   Its not really ideal to move to AM4, especially buying brand new parts - the cost difference is in AM5's favor even with the DDR5 price hike. Any better CPU upgrade down the line would require you to jump to a new platform anyway, which means CPU/MOBO/RAM at a minimum.   Hell, if you're willing to wait a few weeks to see what the holiday ""sales"" bring. (more people are becoming aware that a few weeks before the holiday season price hikes tend to happen so that things like Black Friday and Christmas sales make you believe you're getting a good deal)  Starting off with something like the 9600X build I listed below will give you far more longevity, and the socket itself will have 1 or 2 more CPU generations so you'll still have an upgrade path even if something like AM6 comes out.

Intel,"youre a bit late , RAM prices are through the roof right now. My suggestion would be stay at am4 for now and wait till AM5 components come down in prices, i dont know when, but they will eventually",Neutral
Intel,"That’s amazing, I’ll shop around for some parts and look at the lists others have supplied in this thread, I’d be thrilled if I can get it as low as £400. Thanks so much for this advice.",Positive
Intel,"I’m not especially determined to keep my DDR4 RAM other than the cost of buying DDR5. I’ll have a look at DDR4 options but I’m out of the loop on the 13/14th gen Intel issues. In my ignorance, I’m overly cautious and would probably prefer AMD, and most comments are suggesting the 9600X in that avenue.  Thanks for another perspective, I’ll learn more about the Intel issue and look into DDR4 options too.",Neutral
Intel,Thanks so much. That PCPP list is cheaper than I was hoping so I’m very happy with that. Thank you,Positive
Intel,The future upgrade path was also on my mind. I’ve already got the best the LGA1151 socket offers and it’s been frustrating that I can’t upgrade without replacing basically everything! Starting at the low end of AM5 means I can upgrade to better CPUs a few years from now without replacing the motherboard. Thank you for the comment.,Positive
Intel,"Haha, it’s good to hear directly from people who have recently made similar jumps. You hear barely anyone still talking about hardware this old and the best ways to upgrade.   The combination you mentioned seems almost ubiquitous in this thread, and I’ll probably go for the very same. I hadn’t really thought to look at prebuilt or combo deals but I’ll browse around here. It would be nice to move to watercooling too, just maybe not right now. Thanks for the comment!",Positive
Intel,"Don’t I know it. But with consideration of all the other comments here, and the fact I’ll be spending probably £400 even without RAM, I might as well make it last a bit longer by going for a newer socket. Thanks for the comment still :)",Neutral
Intel,"The Intel issue really only applies to i7 and i9. However, i wouldn't even suggest a 13th gen part because the memory controller on them was borked. They fixed that for 14th gen.",Negative
Intel,All the AM5 processors will likely suit your gaming needs while still giving you a bit of an upgrade path if necessary.,Positive
Intel,"Any benchmarks you see for 13/14 Gen make sure to take note of the RAM it uses.  Most are benchmarked using DDR5 and DDR4 will have lesser performance, especially if the DDR4 you have is  DDR4-2133 or something rather than later production DDR4-3200 or higher.",Neutral
Intel,"In general Am4 is not bad per se, a lot of people on am4 (me included) gonna sit out the launch of am6. Those who started at its launch 2017 got a hell of an upgrade out of that socket. Problem is just its really bad value at its price compared to am5....   Oh. And dont forget to sell your old stuff, you will still get money for it....",Negative
Intel,"No worries brother. I hadn't built a pc in 15 years so figuring all this stuff out again was a fun but painful update. It is surprising how badly connected info is on all this stuff, especially how even a budget gaming rig for around $1k today absolutely smashes hardware that was near the top of the line pre-pandemic.   I went with a peerless assassin 120se air cooler... I helped a buddy replace his water cooler in his pre-built when the little pump died on it... made me a little sour on water cooling too. With a little 65w 9600x processor its only about asthetics as you could cool that with a $20 air cooler if you wanted.   Goodluck and happy hunting!",Negative
Intel,"It applies to all Raptor Lake CPUs with a TDP of 65W or higher, which includes the i5s.  However, it was significantly more common on the i7s and i9s as you mentioned.",Neutral
Intel,"Thanks, not sure I’ll get much for a CPU/motherboard that is definitely faulty somewhere but maybe someone else will be able to diagnose it better and get something out of it.",Neutral
Intel,"If we want to be pedantic about it, it applies only to the *600 class i5s as the 400 and 500 are not Raptor lake.    I do not think i ever saw any evidence of failing 14600 class CPUs and with the BIOS updates, these will pretty much be guaranteed to be fine.

Intel,"9060xt 16gb or 5060ti 16gb  https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html",Neutral
Intel,Basically without a cpu upgrade you'd be holding back most modern gpus you'd put in your system.   I guess you could get a GPU as a future proof. Just remember you won't be getting all of the preformance.,Neutral
Intel,"I was afraid of this, but understood. I'm open to pushing the budget around if needed. The 1440p was not something I originally planned, but after making the swap last year I love it. Again with an eye to future proofing, I get that I need to rethink the budget. If we were talking closer to $500, does that extra $100 do enough to be in a more reasonable ballpark?",Positive
Intel,"You're laying it on a bit thick, it's not even an actual bottleneck on the card. A 9060XT isn't close to overkill",Negative
Intel,I doubt it. They’re aiming for 60fps and are fine with less. And want to spend less than $300. It’s not like they’re trying to put in a 5090.,Neutral
Intel,"Yes $500 is much easier, but that card will work fine for 1440p, it's just that some people don't like buying used.   9060 XT or 7800 XT are both fine for 1440p. 7800 has more raw power but 9060 has better software support. Maybe 16gb 5060ti but they can be hard to find sometimes.",Positive
Intel,No no no. It's more his cpu won't be able to get the most out of a card like that. The card is overkill for his cpu.,Neutral
Intel,I disagree. His cpu is very outdated and will bottle neck any modern GPU that isn't super budget tier.,Negative
Intel,"Got it. Yes I have no issue buying used/was frankly expecting I would. This is all good to know, thank you!",Positive
Intel,"https://youtu.be/TXKyQYiLro8?si=x9qS64Z2w4HIJG3Z  There’s outliers, but not many?  And here’s for the 5060/9060: https://youtu.be/NqRTVzk2PXs?si=0Qp-3x-2sdNJeJKo",Neutral
Intel,"Appreciate the back and forth on this. Frankly I just don't think I can upgrade GPU and CPU at the moment, especially if I need to up the GPU budget by $200. I think $500 is probably swing-able (just not what I was planning). But I imagine even with that push I can't reasonably do both. At the risk of sounding silly...the idea of getting a GPU now that will be limited by CPU, and then upgrading the CPU in a couple years, seems feasible and reasonable to me. I don't mind not being able to push things in terms of gaming, or having to wait a couple years to fully use the GPU's potential.   Again I've been fine with my 1060 for all these years...so it's not like I'm trying to max things out.",Neutral
Intel,"I have an R5 5600 and 5070.... Yes, there is some bottleneck... At 1080p(the card is usually 95%).  At 1440p? Minimal bottleneck, the card goes 100%, but, very rarely there is a stutter, which is alleviated with a bit of tweak on the settings.   To say it would be a bottleneck for a 9060xt or 5060ti is a stretch.",Neutral
Intel,yeah. I bought a 9060xt 16gb to go with my r5 3600 after watching their video.  I don't regret it at all.,Neutral
Intel,This is fair. It's all up to the buyer. I just like giving people as much info as possible before their purchase. All that matters in the end is if the setbacks are worth it for you or not.,Neutral
Intel,"The ~~5060/~~ 9060xt’s are $350. Or, are you using CAD $?",Neutral
Intel,"I have an R5 5600+ rtx5070.  There is a little bottleneck, but you will not really notice it. Especially, if you play a little with settings on 1440p or dsr.  You shouldn't worry too much... That said, 9070 or 5070 /  9060xt or 5060ti, up to you.  Please  note that, the 9070 is faster than the 5070 and you might need to dial it back a little to minimize the CPU bottleneck.  Hope that helps.",Neutral
Intel,Don't shoot the messenger. Don't believe me? Look it up yourself. These aren't my stats lol.,Negative
Intel,"Of course, and appreciate the info/clarity! Again my biggest hurdle here is just being so out of the game that I have no idea what I'm looking at. The comments here are extremely helpful, even if they are just helping me realize my original plans may not make sense, or I need to be realistic about what I may still be compromising!",Negative
Intel,"USD. But, and I realize I didn't make this clear in the OP, I also don't mind buying used if needed.",Neutral
Intel,Look I don't want you to get the wrong idea. I'm not trying to crap on the Ryzen 5600. I've simply pointed out a fact. One that op should be aware of.,Negative
Intel,Exactly. Most people don't upgrade all at once anyways unless it's a new build. It's a very normal thing.,Neutral
Intel,The Powercolor Reaper 9060xt 16gb for $350 at Newegg seems like the right move if you can swing it. Otherwise you’re back to the overwhelming mess of cross referencing past generation GPU performance and used prices.,Neutral
Intel,"Thanks. Yes I think I can, I realize my budget may have been a little unrealistic - $350 should be entirely doable. Thanks for the suggestion/tip here! That said - if we were looking in the $400-$450 range, anything you'd recommend instead?",Positive
Intel,"There’s too many variations of used options out there for me to definitively say. Looking at some charts and some prices, maybe a 4070 super? Less VRAM but still performs quite a bit better than the 9060xt and has DLSS. Older generations of AMD cards won’t have FSR4 access (right now?) which looks better than FSR3.

I think CWWK was the original manufacturer of those boards.  A lot of people, including myself are running it with 64GB of RAM without issues. I'm also running about 30 different containers of all sorts and while there are certainly some use cases it might struggle with, it will be fine with most. Keep in mind it's physical connections are somewhat limited.",Positive
Intel,I hope your RAM isn't actually that slow. The Microcenter bundles tend to be DDR5-6000 CL36.  There's no faster GPU for that price. Anything faster would cost more.  I would recommend the Western Digital SN7100 SSD over the slow one that you picked.,Negative
Intel,should’ve gotten a ram with atleast 6000mhz.,Neutral

First cooler, You can get a [Thermalright Assassin X 90 SE ARGB 32.77 CFM CPU Cooler](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Vz9wrH/thermalright-assassin-x-90-se-argb-3277-cfm-cpu-cooler-ax90se-argb) for 16 to save a few dollars to put somewhere else.   You a bit overkill on the psu as the wattage is nearly double what you might be putting together. Great for later upgrades but overkill for this build.   It is not a bad combo deal but there are better choices to be had. The ram is slow but you can use it for now. I would change the ssd. That is a gen 3 and you wil want at least a gen4 with a higher speed.   Using your combo I would change the cooler, cheaper option with good performance, the ssd, while budget and not the fastest it is 2tb gen 4 with decent speed and fully modular 750 80+ gold atx  or you can stick with your 850 watt which ever you prefer.   That is a good card for the cost but i would be tempted to switch it out with a 9060xt 16 gig or 5060ti   [https://pcpartpicker.com/user/xxSineaterxx/saved/#view=YXkXYJ](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/xxSineaterxx/saved/#view=YXkXYJ)  With the 9060xt 16gb reaper the cost is slightly higher but with that card you should get better performance.",Neutral

Intel,"thanks for the advice i'm considering changing the psu and storage for sure, also your pc list is private i can't see it",Neutral
Intel,Both.  The RAM in your PCPartPicker build is DDR5-5600 CL46. This is incredibly slow and I honestly doubt that's what you bought from Micro Center.  The Silicon Power A60 SSD you picked is also slow.,Neutral
Intel,"Ram companies don't matter 95% of the time. What you need to watch for are the specs.   CL is your rams reaction time. CL30 or 32 is good.  And MT/MGHz, are it's actual speed. 6000mt or 5400mt is good.  In your last post, we advised you that your ram was too fast because you had a CL28 ram kit. you might have over-adjusted and picked slow ram, my friend. 5600mt is good speed, but cl46 is slow reaction time.  A CL32 5400mt will probably be faster than your ram.   Honestly, everything else is great👍 this pc will serve you for a  good while, even with the slow ram.",Neutral

Intel,The best upgrade would be the 7800x3D/B850 MoBo/2x16gb 6000 CL30 RAM. It will absolutely be an increase in FPS and it will improve your FPS drops.,Positive
Intel,"If you are building your computer and unless you are spending like under $700 on the computer I would recommend that you go with an AM5 CPU. AM4 only really makes sense if you really have to like get under $700 and more in the $600 and below range.  If you are building on the AM5 platform then you probably want either a 7600X or a 9600X. The 9600X is only about 3 to 5% faster than the 7600X, but the price has come down considerably and has even dipped cheaper a few times.   If you're going all out then you can get a 7800X3D or a 9800XD3, but I would really only consider those for like really top-end expensive builds that are more than two grand. They shine the best when paired with a high end GPU on low end resolution because you can get ridiculous fps. They also do a little bit better on extremely CPU intensive games but I don't know if battlefield 6 is that intense, I'm pretty sure like a 7600 would be fine.",Neutral

I will also add that having the 7800x3D isn't a must. A 9600x would also be better than your current CPU.

RDNA1 and RDNA2 GPU's will continue to receive the same game ready style drivers as they always have.   It just means that if AMD develop anything new, like FSR4, it won't be made backward compatible with older cards.

Though saying that is there not profit in providing value for customers on older hardware, doesn't that build the brand, etc. or are they just interested in pushing the next generation of eWaste into the bin sooner.",Neutral

Intel,AMD wasting money on these marketing people smh.,Negative
Intel,">is that any NEW software tech that's developed from now on, will only be available for 7000 series and up GPU's  Well that's disappointing. It's way too soon. I'm sure it's not just due to hardware limitations, since 6000 and 7000 share similar hardware necessary for upscaling. They can't throw that ""we drop support because compatibility blah blah"" card on consumers.  Well on a positive note, it's good that 6000 series will still get FSR4 support thru mods, although that might be limited, as some online games could trigger anticheats.",Negative
Intel,That just sounds like BS from AMD.   Why come out and say something you already said. What this sounds like is AMD trying to back peddle a decision that would cost them future sales. The best part is if they get this out there now. Then oops don't update for games moving forward. Then no one will say a word. It will be done and over with.   Everyone knew FSR4 and the like wasn't coming to RDNA1/2 gpu's they said this before. They don't back port new stuff anyway.   So just more corpo speak for hey we screwed up now forget bout it look a shiny thing consumer look at the shiny.,Negative
Intel,Which I feel like they didn’t need to say? Like obviously not every feature is going to be supported an older hardware already right now FSR 4 is not available on the 7000 series though the rumour is they will have it eventually. Like why is this something the end user needs to be informed about?   I almost wonder if they were planning on pulling Support and then just decided to say that it was misinterpreted because they saw the reaction,Negative
Intel,"> RDNA1 and RDNA2 GPU's will continue to receive the same game ready style drivers as they always have.  Where did they say that.

Intel,the original message was slightly ambiguous but then literally every news outlet choose to interpret it in the very worst way possible and then add clickbait headlines on top of that misinterpretation. The resulting mess is only marginally AMD's fault.  They aren't saying anything now that wasn't in what they said originally.,Negative

Intel,"I'm pretty sure the clarification had a big asterisk of something along the lines ""we will continue updating them according to market demand"", i think they're still moving them to maintenance mode the same they did for Polaris and Vega which means they will continue necessary bug and security fixes, unlikely to recieve optimizations (tho still possible) but more importantly no new features will be added, this kinda sucks when you consider RTX 20 series which is older than RDNA2 is still receiving partial support for new DLSS features.",Negative
Intel,Oh take us back!,Neutral
Intel,"It did recieve AFMF and Anti lag 2, but now they pulled the plug and new features won't be added even if they can work on these cards.

Intel,"Why are you pissed? Amd clarified that they messed up with communication. 60 series cards will still get game ready drivers, just not new tech that comes out. So if/when fsr4 happens, 60 series cards won’t get it. That’s it.",Negative
Intel,They have already reversed this decision. They are not in fact ending game ready driver support. Just new features (think FSR4 / MFG) won't come to older cards.,Negative
Intel,"Cable issue is due to a well known, incredibly well documented design flaw that has been detailed by people like DerBauer. As to the AMD thing, as I said in my comment in this thread, AMD have already allowed the engineers to clarify the fucktastically stupid statement made by the marketing department.

Take a guess where I was lol.   Nepo/crony hires are the worst because they are like the only ppl in the company that can get away with being totally inept.   This does not excuse AMD though since they are way past the point.

Intel,I mean it would have been great if they officially supported 6000.

No different than the Dot Com bubble or Mobile App bubble or social media bubble. Some companies like OpenAI or Google or Anthropic will ""win"", they'll buy up any startup/smaller company that actually shows promise (or potentially has promise and would deny competitors the engineers working there) then the market will calcify.

Per the UPS I have attached to it, that single server uses around 200-400W the average is around 1700kW/h per year, and this is a fairly inefficient homelab.   Image/Video generation on the other hand, requires a lot more processing power, as anyone who's worked VFX will tell you, but this isn't the bulk of work that LLMs are doing. It's also why AI was able to ""pop up"" on every site so quickly, as it's really not significantly more intensive for Cloud providers than most K8S systems. This isn't a _pro_ AI comment btw, just noting that the power consumption aspect is a bit of misinformation that companies like OpenAI are _themselves_ pushing as if they make it seem too intensive to ""get in"" at this point, they solidify themselves as the defacto winner of the AI bubble. It's also why they recently have started bringing up ""ethical concerns"" about data theft and wanting regulation on data scraping...because they've already scraped everything. They want regulations now because it helps solidify their position.",Neutral

Intel,"To be fair I think it greatly depends on the thing. As a software developer who works on a website for a company, there's no real reason for us to host our site locally if it's cheaper and faster to deploy to the cloud. But our software isn't meant to run on end user's hardware, it's just a website, so it's not like it's something you'd be owning in the first place. I think that applications that you would normally run locally should at minimum be *available* for local use, if not exclusively done that way, but for anything that's normally hosted remotely anyways, it makes sense at a high level to concentrate them in data centers and allocate resources as needed rather than having everyone try and purchase and maintain physical servers. The main issue I have with it is that it's controlled by private corporations. A network run by some kind of non profit coalition or something to that effect that sells the computing time essentially at cost and with redundant data centers in every region would save a lot of people time and money on server maintenance, space, and the actual cost of the physical servers without giving control of it to a private entity.",Neutral

Intel,"I think there’s a lot of use cases that you’re right about not needing to be cloud based  and don’t get me wrong having only 3 providers(AWS, azure, ibm) is a serious problem but there’s are plenty of legitimate use cases that cloud should be utilized to various levels.   The industry I work in is the target of a lot of ransom ware attacks. On prem solutions can lead to singular failure points. Having a cloud based system that allows for these places to get around that. Natural disasters is another great example.   Even if your service is on prem/local you should probably still have a consistent backup of all the data. I’ve seen customers that had hurricanes who had a dedicated secondary location still be affected. Even though they did it right with 2 very separated (50 or so miles of separation) data locations they still lost a LOT of data because of the hurricane and subsequent flooding and tornadoes. Not to mention the cost of having to maintain 2 separate dedicated data storage facilities is incredibly cost prohibitive.",Negative

Intel,"HDV is just overall better. Full 2nd PCIe slot, more USB, better performance. The H version is the absolute minimum quality.  Well, you can probably find an LED version for those others, too. They are just a tier above the assassin spirit in terms of cooling performance, which can be relevant for future upgrades and noise levels.",Positive

But if you plan to keep this system for a couple years, the 15€ more now for a better MoBo might save you 100€ for a new MoBo later and cost you maybe 2-3€ per year of usage. If I had to choose, I'd rather get a cheaper SSD than a low-quality MoBo (especially since latter can make your SSD worse anyways).",Neutral
Intel,Please just explain why,Neutral
Intel,"I'd swap the motherboard for something non-Asrock, since Asrock boards have been known to blow up AM5 CPUs.  You also might be able to get better RAM (DDR5-6000 CL30) for cheaper.

For games multi-GPU is gone for good (too few users, too large cost of development, no return of investment for game Studios). But in simulation/HPC/AI software multi-GPU is very common as it allows to go beyond the VRAM capacity of a single large GPU for cheaper.",Neutral
Intel,"sli/crossfire were killed for good reason, its just a bad time all around if half of your gpu's core/cache is located a foot away from the other half, unless your baseline performance is so damn low that the microstutters just get lost in the noise.  ultimately chiplet cpu/gpu designs are basically just an evolved form of sli/crossfire, and we're happily starting to get quite good at those.

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative
Intel,One thing I appreciate about AMD is having the lowest CPU overhead for their graphics drivers. Makes a difference if you're CPU limited in a game.,Neutral
Intel,So Nvidia now has the lowest driver overhead? Seems like they took the HUB video seriously,Neutral
Intel,So the money you save on a GPU you will need to spend on a better CPU??  Might as well get a faster GPU.,Positive
Intel,Interesting that B580 doesn't look bad at all with a 13600k. I wonder what it's like with a 13400 or 12600k. It seems like just having those extra threads provided by the e-cores takes care of the overhead it needs.,Positive
Intel,"Unless you're running a CPU that's *many* many years old, GPU overhead is not really something you need to worry about. Whether AMD has less overhead or Nvidia has less, it really doesn't matter.",Neutral
Intel,"On an older post an Intel graphics engineer explained the issue, it isn't what you said. Intel is too verbose in commands which slows everything down.",Negative
Intel,I'm fairly sure they use dxvk for d3d9 to 11.,Neutral
Intel,Could just be a cache issue,Neutral
Intel,Battlemage drivers use the cpu for software accelerating certain processes that are not being hardware accelerated in the GPU.,Neutral
Intel,Glad you brought up Nvidia as I didn’t know this had improved until the testing around Arc showed it had gone.,Positive
Intel,"According to the graphs, AMD has slightly less overhead than NVIDIA.",Neutral
Intel,"No, they do not.  The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software.  They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  The main example that seems to suggest otherwise is actually a demonstration of nVidia's forced threading of DX11 games, which can increase performance despite the increased overhead it entails, when the CPU has enough headroom overall (i.e. it doesn't eat into the single-thread performance).",Negative
Intel,"Lowest with DX11 and older, but not with the newer APIs",Neutral
Intel,And when is the last time HUB did a dedicated video showing the improvement in overhead?,Neutral
Intel,or it's just a cache/memory access issue,Neutral
Intel,"The overhead is minimal for both AMD GPUs and NVIDIA GPUs, which is probably why reviewers didn't look at the overhead until Intel GPUs came along.",Neutral
Intel,"> Unless you're running a CPU that's many many years old, GPU overhead is not really something you need to worry about.   That's just not true with Battlemage.  CPUs released in 2024 showed the issue in testing.    It's not year of release, it's capabilities.",Negative
Intel,"Intel uses software translation for DX11 and lower, so it does matter for them.",Neutral
Intel,"Hmm, Nvidia lost less performance going from 14900k to 13600k than AMD but more when going down to 12100",Neutral
Intel,"> No, they do not. The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software. They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  This was true for Alchemist but not for Battlemage.",Negative
Intel,That's not true. Intel's issue is being too verbose in commands/calls.,Negative
Intel,"Never, because HUB doesn't like portraying Nvidia in any light besides negative.",Negative
Intel,HUB used DX12 games that also showed the issue.  It's something else.,Neutral
Intel,"The comment to which I am replying is talking about nVidia, not Intel.",Neutral
Intel,"I’m pretty sure HUB doesn’t like Nvidia *or* AMD. They’re calling it how it is, these parts are too damn expensive.",Negative
Intel,That's actually... just worse news.,Negative
Intel,I always dreamt of the day APUs become power houses.,Neutral
Intel,"Is it my expectations being too high or this ain't a huge uplift? To go back to the classic: hopefully Zen 6 with RDNA 4 will offer a bigger uplift. We only have to wait a year and a half...  Anyway, question for the more knowledgeable people: how could the 890M perform with a 50W chip variant, but with 5600 SO-DIMM RAM? What to expect?",Neutral
Intel,"I find it sad that most review outlet is not testing CCX latency for these new CPUs.  These Zen 5 + Zen 5c have insanely high cross CCX latency, 180ms tested by geekerwan to be exact. For reference the 5950x had a 70ms latency for their cross ccd latency and the 4 ccd 1950x had a 150ms cross ccd latency with the closet 2 ccd and 200ms between the furthest 2.  Essentially games will be limited to the 5.1ghz peak 4 core zen5 core cluster or the 3.3ghz peak 8 core zen5c core cluster.",Neutral
Intel,Damn Why is AMD even involved in iGPU,Negative
Intel,"If this is true, Strix Point is going to claim total dominance over the GTX 1650 market. Won't be until 2023 when the theoretical RTX 4050 is released to surpass Strix Point's efficiency. Then super budget-friendly Strix Halo will come next year and take the RTX 2080's lunch money. Game over Nvidia.",Positive
Intel,"Strix Halo is rumored to be a whopping 40 CUs of RDNA3.5 so...   That'll do it no sweat, if they release it.",Neutral
Intel,almost there,Neutral
Intel,"We're a ways off from that still. These Strix Point 890M results are comparable to 1/2 the performance of the RX 6600. That's only good enough for \~30 FPS in Assassins Creed Mirage at 1080p Max.  I think this will be great for non-gaming purposes, like Adobe, Autodesk and so on. 890M should be a photo editing powerhouse.",Positive
Intel,"I mean current consoles are already APU power houses, they can give you 120fps depending on the game, and 30-60fps depending on what mode you select. And these consoles are pretty power constrained and pared down compared to PCs. So this APU here could easily double the performance of a console.   That's tapping on 4070/7800 levels of performance.",Neutral
Intel,Never gonna happen as long as they use DDR memory.  The only powerful APUs are those that use GDDR or HBM. See: every AMD-powered console and the MI300A.,Negative
Intel,"Radeon iGPUs are mostly limited by the shared RAM bandwidth. I was thinking of getting an 8700G a little while ago, and the benchmarks varied wildly depending on RAM frequency and overclocks.  Maybe they'll improve it by hooking it up to a wider GDDR bus in laptops, similar to how the current PS5 and Xboxes work (IIRC?)",Neutral
Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks. Intel is already moving on it and I think the main thing holding AMD back is that they rely on 3rd parties for memory packaging so the capacity goes to the more lucrative enterprise chips first.",Neutral
Intel,"The iGPU uplift is extremely underwhelming, I guess this is why Asus did the ROG Ally X model instead of waiting for these chips. I wouldnt be surprised if Lunar Lake with Xe2 passes Zen 5's iGPU at lower power levels, at higher ones im sure RNDA 3.5 will be ahead.",Neutral

Intel,7500mhz ram and the 780m,Neutral
Intel,"if you don't consider power, sure, but in that case you may as well go discrete. efficiency is a big reason for these AIO packages and on-package memory can prevent breaking the power budget while pushing higher bandwidth.",Neutral
Intel,"Indeed. Also the closer the memory is to the CPU, the higher the speeds, thus bandwidth. On-package memory will always be faster.",Neutral
Intel,"Have _you_ looked at the actual game benchmarks in the review? The Ally X (a low power handheld) is within 1fps of the bottom of the 890m laptops. It's 5-9fps to the very fastest (again a higher power laptop!!), all at 1080p high settings which i think should  be the target for this range of entries in the roundup.  There is nothing like a 40-60% uplift in those games and that very standard resolution? I was stoked for Strix Point myself but this is super underwhelming.",Neutral

Intel,Dont expect 40CUs in a handheld anytime soon,Neutral
Intel,"Based on the results, it seems like the next steam deck might be more than a year away. Not particularly impressive gains from the previous gen.",Negative
Intel,"It'll need to be a custom tooled APU like Aerith/Van Gogh if it is to take full advantage of the 890m.     Nearly all of the configs that release of 16cu Point APU or 40cu Halo will be an APU slapped in a chassis without an adequate power or memory bandwidth setup for the igpu.     What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra. Its desktop tower chip is behind the entry level mobile OS chip from its competitor. It is a decade behind the desktop chips of its competitor, itis hardly Monster class.",Neutral

And AMD ""can make"" such APUs -> PS5 Pro (as a more cost effective solution). AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative
Intel,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",Negative

If Intel can be competitive in the budget market it will at least put a fire under amd to lower their prices/make a better valued product.",Negative
Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't.

Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral
Intel,"This was a graphics card, not a ‘GPU’ in terms that we understand them now, just to bolster the point about how much of a disparity this comparison reveals.",Neutral
Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so?

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.

Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.

This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.

In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.

It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?

My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone.

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Got rid of my EVGA 760 when the 900 cards and AMD's 300 series came out, jumped to R9 390 and haven't looked back since (R9 390>RX 5700xt>RX 7700xt) The only issue i ever had with AMD was the first few months of the 5700xt and its awful unplayable performance issues in DX9 games, but that was solved within months, and they eventually went on to improve opengl performance on Navi/RDNA as well which was a nice welcome surprise. Ive had a few hiccups that looked like driver issues that turned out to actually be Windows issues, and i always wonder if people are quick to blame AMD for issues because of what they have heard vs actually investigating and finding the real cause of the problem. More often than not any system issues im having end up being the fault of Microsoft, or a specific game wasnt tested on AMD properly and the blame lies with the devs.",Negative

There wasn't a 3080 or 3090 available back then, otherwise I would've rather bought one.

And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.  I think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable. There need to be a proper high-grade (and low grade) reliable way to avoid that.  Just sucks it took this long, and so much effort to get AMD to pay notice to the issue at hand here.

For context - Unity VRAM usage is - Unity allocating ""how much it want"" and in case of two different GPU Unity may allocate less or more in DX-API, or DX-API have some internal behavior for Unity case on Nvidia so it allocating less.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

I would absolutely *love* to see 4K TV manufacturers offer DisplayPort in future TVs, but that's probably not happening anytime soon.   About Nova you're probably right. But please keep in mind, that its scope is much more narrow than any other open source driver out there. Mostly, it only serves as an adapter between the Linux kernel and GSP firmware. Current Noveau implementations reflect this: GSP features are easier to implement and thus currently more feature complete. And since there is an AI/Nvidia hype train at the moment, they will probably also dedicate more resources into it than say stratis-storage.",Neutral

Intel,"The price of the GPU is not determined by the transistor count, but by the DIE size.

Intel,"> You state you never had issues, however, how many times have you had a game randomly crash with no error/fault or some random error that is cryptic? How often have you assumed this is the game's fault?  I'm not the guy you're replying to, but for me, almost never.  I've had exactly one driver-based AMD issue - when I first got my 5700XT on release, there was a weird driver bug that caused the occasional BSOD when viewing video in a browser - this was fixed quickly.  My gaming stability issues were always caused by unstable RAM timings and CPU OC settings - since I upgraded to an AM5 platform with everything stock, I'm solid as a rock. My 7900XTX has been absolutely perfect.  There is an unfair perception in gaming with AMD's drivers where people think they are far worse than they really are - it's a circlejerk at this point.  Your issue is different (and valid), you don't need to conflate the known issues in professional use cases with gaming - it'll just get you pushback because people who use AMD cards for gaming (like me) know the drivers are fine for gaming, which makes you come across as being hyperbolic - and if you're being hyperbolic about the gaming stuff, what else are you being hyperbolic about?

No, Radeon VII and other Vega products were killed off because they were very expensive to produce and they weren't moving enough units at any price to justify any further investment or even any meaningful support.  Everyone paying attention called this when they revealed Vega, and even long before with the tragic marketing.  Insert the GIF of Raja partying at the AMD event, complete with cigar.  People love coming up with theories as to what critical flaw or failure point caused a given generation of AMD GPUs to suck, and how those will be fixed in the next generation.  From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.  Does AMD need to improve things?  Of course.  But to act like there's 1 critical flaw, or that something is fundamentally broken and making the cards unusable for a given purpose, or to cite George Hotz as an authority is just way off target.",Negative

Intel,"Good ol' ""it works on my machine"".

Same goes to H.264 hardware encoder being worst of the bunch for years.  And the average joe just doesn't use Linux, if they do, then few of of them actually toy around virtualization, then even fewer of them poke around hypervisors with device passthrough(instead of using emulated devices, which has poor performance and compatibility). It really is the most niche of the niche circle. I'm not looking down on users or playing gatekeeping/elitism but that's just a hard pill to swallow.  But that doesn't mean AMD should be ghosting the issues as people have been expressing their concerns even on datacenter systems where real money flows.  How many r/Ayymd trolls actually know VDI, VFIO and let alone what ""reset"" means?

With how many people this happen with, it is not problem of Adrenalin itself (otherwise it would've been reported A LOT more than i can find).   They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.     From global issues with CPU OC was only one i mentioned. When AMD integrated Ryzen Master, old GPU OC presets did reset CPU OC values to default.

However, this better than native upscaling narrative seems more like a belief (or a marketing push/tactic) than reality.   - If action is high enough, it probably won't matter much, but in single-player games where I like to look around, I just can't deal with the resolution loss.

Intel,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?

Intel,I hope they will bundle this game with CPUs/GPUs,Neutral
Intel,holy hell so for 1080p you need a 1440p card because not even a RX 7600 is on par with a 3060ti or a 6700XT,Negative
Intel,Recently upgraded GPU and CPU and crazy that newer games are already requiring the newest GPUs to play them. Personally I don't think it's a horrible thing but at the same time it just screams horrible optimization.,Negative

Intel,"Another garbage with forced upscaling at baseline. When upscaling winded up - everyone was ""Hell yeah, high refresh rate AAA gaming""  Fast forward to today: ""FSR performance just to hit 1080p 60fps - yay..""   I fucking knew it.. it was so obvious upscaling will turn into this and replace game optimizations. Why optimizing shit, when you can tell people to turn on fucking FSR / DLSS / XeSS performance??   What a fucking shitshow... And few weeks back when I said I'm not gonna buy AMD GPU again because upscaling is getting mandatory and DLSS is just objectively superior - I was laughed in the face. Every major AAA game onwards will be shoving up upscaling as base line performance - so your typical 60fps marks (and 30fps - yes apparently that is still a thing on PC in 2023). There's no escape from this.",Negative
Intel,Damn. My 5700XT did Mirage fine on Medium/Low shadows. Now its basement quality.,Negative
Intel,This is starting to get scary and not cool. Every stat is not native performance and a 6800xt with fsr at 1440p is only pulling 60fps?!?!? What the actual fuck is going on?!?!? Midrange is definitely on its death bed if this is the new norm...,Negative

Intel,"Hopefully this is another Alan Wake situation where the game performs better than what their system requirements would suggest. With this being a based on a movie game, I don’t have super high hopes that that’ll be the case though. Going from movie to game and vice versa almost always has bad results.   Also, displaying system requirements with upscaling is a bad joke. This is basically saying you’re not getting native 1080p 60fps without a 6800xt or 3080. Upscaling is definitely becoming the crutch a lot of folks feared it would be.",Negative
Intel,I thought upscaling technology is for low end gamers to get more FPS or people who work on 4k monitors and use upscaling to get better frames on them. but it seems to be used as an excuse for bad game optimization. What a complete joke!!,Negative

A group of people I play with were all playing Remnant 2, and I FSR was driving me crazy, they all have way less powerful computers than I do, and none of them cared at all FSR was on. In fact they were impressed with how well it ran and how it looked. I think there is a general 80% of the PC population that doesn't mess with graphic settings and just wants the game to play. I'm a min/maxer when it comes to graphics where I constantly tweak it until I get the perfect output for me.     I'd love to have real data from games like this on how many people actively change graphic settings.",Neutral

Intel,Nope we as a community abused a nice thing,Positive
Intel,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",Neutral
Intel,Didn't take them long to make upscaling worthless.,Negative
Intel,i smell a burgeoning cottage industry of game spec reviewers!,Neutral
Intel,"I've hated upscaling since the beginning.   Now, it's being proven right in our faces that companies are no longer making 100% they're making 45% done games, and then they rely on upscaling and fake frames to do the rest.   Why have a fully optimized game that runs well natively when you can just lower the resolution by 3x then have frame generation help?   Full force ahead to frame generation= Every game will be optimized so badly that you're forced to upscale",Negative
Intel,"It’s literally right there in the hardware specs. 1080p fsr2 quality is 720p input resolution, so at native the game runs at 720p low on a 1070 or 5700.  It is the inverse of what reviewers have been doing with their benchmarks - if you are a fan who really has a stick up their ass about native res, just do the math yourself. They’ve given you all the pieces you need to calculate it out yourself, but that’s not how the game is supposed to be run so they aren’t going to put native res in the official marketing material.  Games are optimized around upscaling now and it is unhelpful and misleading to pretend otherwise. Rendering 4x as many pixels is *obviously* going to throw things off with more intensive effects, and lead to a generally unplayable experience.",Neutral

Intel,"RT is the future. With this game and Alan Wake 2 using software RT at all times and hardware RT for anything beyond ""low"", RT is the future.

Intel,and with fsr now standard on consoles it(or a similar tech) will be standard on pc :(,Neutral
Intel,"people also forget both AMD and nvidia didn't really offer a generation leap in GPU performance this gen, sure it's popular to call games ""unoptimized"" (I know many AAA releases are, not denying that) but the issue compounds with the fact that game devs couldn't predict a GPU generation to be this bad caused by inflated crypro-boom margins a generation prior",Negative
Intel,"As with almost every game release recently, expect the game to perform a bit better than the requirements.    Sometimes the hardware can achieve 60 FPS most of the time but drops below that in other times, so the devs just say it's guaranteed 30 FPS and call it a day. If you look at the 5700 vs 6700XT, the gap is almost 50% in most titles, this means that if the numbers for the 5700 were accurate then the 6700XT will be getting around 45 FPS at 1080p low (unless the game utilizes special hardware only available on the 6700XT) but the game targets 60 FPS at 1080p high on the 6700XT which leads me to believe the 5700 is gonna perform much better which should leave room for turning off upscaling.",Positive
Intel,"It does state ray tracing in the top right, we don't know if that's included in the requirements or not. I would definitely reserve judgment until we find out.",Neutral

Intel,"In 2023, RX 5700 performs equally or better than the RTX 2060 Super/2070. The 5600XT is more like a 2060 competitor.

Another thing is that the game is doing is software based RT by default and that might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.",Negative

Try path tracing in Cyberpunk with reduced rays & bounces and you'll still get great soft lighting and GI without most of the performance hit when full tilt.

Intel,"Nah, I think we're really beginning to see a trend here with abusing upscaling for free mileage.  Not that upscaling isn't great but...  Apart from RT, on medium settings, I can't really see    massive improvements on visual quality that would warrant such a massive increase on requirements.  UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  We'll probably see this continuing to be a trend for a while, and then as tech novelty wears out, some devs will come out with more optimized and scalable titles.  With hardware prices being as they are, and with 60fps now being highly requested in consoles as well, it's pretty much a given.",Negative
Intel,"People accepted upscaling with open arms, so now devs know they can rely on people using it. Thus they don't have to care about optimizing for native res anymore. Oh you have a 4k card? Okay well we'll make sure it can run the game at 1080p so you can upscale it.",Neutral
Intel,"No average consumer wanted to come to this point. The market leader started pushing upscaling instead of just making stronger GPU’s and there’s nothing AMD can do to win them, only join them.",Negative
Intel,Turns out TAA is worse than AI TAA with AI upscaling.   Of course devs are gonna use it to cover their own asses. And they get perf boost!  Let's face it. The FUTURE is AI everything. Nobody is gonna talk shit about frame generation and upscaling when it looks perfect each frame.,Negative
Intel,But it does in many ways.,Neutral
Intel,"I don't know who those people are. I play all my games on native, whether I'm using an amd or nvidia card.",Neutral
Intel,"dlss looks better than native with TAA because taa is so bad, but dlaa/fsraa at native >>>> upscaling",Negative
Intel,you think engine devs can pressure AMD and even Nvidia? Come on man. Be real.,Negative
Intel,"Ever notice how multi-GPU vanished the moment DX12 shifted the onus from AMD/Nvidia over to the developers? It shows just how much effort they put into getting SLI/Crossfire working when developers instantly drop them the moment they have to do the bulk of the work (significantly less, I might add) themselves.",Neutral
Intel,"If I relabeled ""Medium"" preset to ""Ultra"" preset and changed nothing else and told you that you can run this game at Native 1440P Ultra on a midrange 7800XT card and get 60+FPS, would that be ""optimized"" now?",Neutral
Intel,speaking facts my guy,Neutral
Intel,You shouldn't have downvote dood wtf redditors ?,Negative
Intel,People with AMD cards dislike upscaling more because FSR sucks ass lol.,Negative
Intel,"Uhm, me btw...",Neutral
Intel,"> Who actually plays games at native these days, if it has upscaling?  I do.",Neutral
Intel,"I won't judge your preferences, but at least using native rendenring isnt the clown show we have here. Native 4k look the same no matter what gpu render it (performances aside). Now with all the quality preset, we can't figure what quality to expect. 4k60fps at balenced preset? What's that crap even supposed to mean as thoses presets vary from title to title, from NVIDIA to amd. And btw, I'm still using fxaa over taa and fsr when i can, don't ask me why.",Negative
Intel,"You're even seeing this on console, where Spiderman 2 now has RT reflections in every mode. Even Unreal 5's Lumen renderer is a software raytracer that can be hardware accelerated.  RT is the future because there are scenarios that rasterized rendering is just not capable of resolving. Screen space reflection artifacts, light leaking, weird glow on indirectly lit models... I find these so distracting and immersion breaking.",Negative
Intel,onto absolutely nothing.,Negative
Intel,"Wait what? No performance improvement this gen? Bullshit, RTX 4090 is literally 2 times faster than RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 is only 10% Faster than the 3080  you do the math. RTX 4080 is 50% Faster than RTX 3080.",Negative
Intel,Or the game performs at 50 fps at 1080p low on 5700 but 50fps is a weird number to target and they can't say 60 so they just say 30fps and call it a day.,Negative
Intel,Not if it's using mesh shaders like Alan wake. In that game the GTX 1650 outperforms the 1080ti.,Neutral
Intel,The game is raytracing only with a ridiculous ammount of foooliage.,Negative
Intel,"I'm so glad this is finally getting more main stream spotlight.  I do a little bit in Dota 2 and the amount of people that simply have a terrible experience because of a single stick of ram in that title is staggering.  Sure, it's an outlier, but a lot of esports/CPU bound games see similar issues.",Negative
Intel,i wonder when dual rank and dual channel will start being listed too. since dual rank does help gaming,Neutral
Intel,Honestly my 1070 still runs great for what it is. It’s in my sons rig now because it couldn’t keep up with 1440p depending on the game and definitely not 4k. Still a fairly solid 1080p card.,Positive
Intel,False.  guy blocked me lmao,Negative
Intel,"I thought that was on Linux, though I might be wrong",Neutral
Intel,1070 doesn't have hardware RT though.,Neutral
Intel,According to the technical director there's no non-raytracing mode. I'm assuming that means software ray tracing for the minimum spec.  Source: Skill Up video - https://youtu.be/v91y87R5iDk?t=332 (5m32s),Neutral
Intel,Spoken like someone who has never upscaled 1080p content on a 1440 screen. The pixel ratios are all off. It's fucked.  1440p is perfect for watching old 720p HD content though.,Negative
Intel,Completely agree.,Neutral
Intel,Damn my brain must have been on auto pilot. I'm so used to 2160p + FSR quality neatly equalling 1440p.,Negative
Intel,I see the 5700 and the GTX 1070 on the minimum specs. Are those cards going to be RT capable for this game? (It's 30FPS LOW with FSR but still.),Neutral
Intel,"Sometimes the DigitalFoundry reviewers use their meme powers for good (eg:fighting shader compilation stutter), but their  >""it's better than native!""   memeing about upscaling seems to have gone sideways.",Negative
Intel,"Dude tells truth, go to Nvidia sub, and you fond every second post someone telling that DLSS looks better then native, and every time I tell them that I can tell the difference between native and upscaled and it's not better then natibe they call me a liar and downvote.",Negative
Intel,It's purely on the devs for targeting low performance.   We could be getting 240fps at 4K using those upscaling techniques.,Negative
Intel,"Derp, derp.",Neutral
Intel,Sounds like John on Direct Foundry Direct every week.,Neutral
Intel,"""Avatar will be a title that will only appear with ray tracing. But we're developing the game so that the quality and performance will be scalable.""  Seems I was right.",Positive
Intel,">I guess the wonders of everyone jumping on the Swiss knife engine approach ue rather than doing their own engines made for their games.  Facepalm...  Avatar Frontiers of Pandora very literally uses a custom engine, not Unreal Engine.",Neutral
Intel,Yep. This company learned something from all the failure game launches that happened this year. The game companies can't just implement one gpu company's tech and not the others bc then it'll only work on the one gpu that you implemented the tech for and it won't work on the other gpus from other companies. Meaning for example if a game company only implemented fsr it's only going to work on amd gpus and not on Nvidia and Intel gpus and vise versa is true too for both Nvidia and Intel gpus for dlss and xess.,Negative
Intel,Avatar is RT only. There is no non RT mode.,Neutral
Intel,This is mad with snowdrop engine. It's Ubisoft they don't use unreal...,Neutral
Intel,"Yep, I missed that. Good call! Makes sense why the specs are a bit higher then but if it is forced on, that's going to be rough on any one with a more mid tier card.",Negative
Intel,">  Consoles use mostly FSR balanced  heck sometimes they use performance or less, heck a lot of the time even. Especially with RT or performance modes",Neutral
Intel,They have really long way to go. Take for example Lords of the Fallen - UE5's TSR is better than FSR. Take Alan Wake 2 and you get ton of shimmering on the edges. It's also not like nvidia not improving - so while AMD makes a step forward so will do nvidia..   There's also question how much they improve without dedicated accelerators that both Intel and nvidia is using. Intel jumped late to the party and they're already ahead - which just shows how much AMD cares. It's rally embarrassing considering both XBOX and PlayStation are also relying on FSR - ant that's bigger market than what nvidia has.,Neutral
Intel,I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?  I mean the facts are the facts. I need to play on lower settings till we get a 5070 or 8800xt.,Neutral
Intel,"It uses their own in-house engine, Snowdrop. The last game this developer did was The Division II which was excellent.",Negative
Intel,"Took a look at some gameplay on YouTube, and it does look nice enough, though water looked like ass, and as mentioned already, it's an in-house engine (which is nice to see TBH).",Positive
Intel,"Next gen seems promising so far, low native rez hidden by upscaling, 60 FPS target on +500$ GPUs, traversal stuttering thanks to the glorious UE5. But hey, we have great reflections on puddles so at least we can take good looking screenshots.",Positive
Intel,You will never see a high production game from Ubisoft ever on the Steam store ever again at initial launch.  They are the anti-christ of the gaming industry seriously.,Negative
Intel,Consoles are the baseline in most multiplat games and they've been using upscaling since forever. The real reason is just that we don't have GPUs anymore that are 10x faster than consoles like last gen. You can't bruteforce high resolutions in games that run at like 720p on consoles with GPUs that are only 2-3x faster.  If upscaling didn't exist on PC the minimum here would just be 720p at the minimum and 1080p-1440p at the max.,Negative
Intel,Next-gen doesn't mean that current gen can run it well. It means it's so far ahead that most curren-gen hardware can't run it properly + top-end hardware can only barely run it well.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly. These paid exclusive games launches only make me care less whenever they actually release.  It's not just Epic, Meta has done it with several games (Moss Book 2) and when a proper looking pcvr port comes a year later it sells bad because people forgot about it.",Negative
Intel,"Is that with significant RT? I assumed it was ""normal"" ultra settings.  Still I can play Far Cry 6 and RE4 with AMD sponsored RT at 4k native with 100fps. This game will have to look amazing to justify what... a quarter of that performance?",Neutral
Intel,"You are correct. I overlooked the part where, under Ultra settings, it said that was with FSR2. Now it doesn't seem as bad. I mean, it's still not good because it's rendering somewhere between 1080p and 1440p, but at least it's not 30 fps without Frame Gen/60 fps with it like I thought.",Neutral
Intel,"It might be, AFAIK neither Nvidia nor AMD still support their implementation of it in their drivers.  But I've tried it on a few games and it is pretty cool to me, much stronger than almost any modern 3D movie (IMO why 3D has gone into hibernation), and I gather that Cameron designed the franchise around 3D.  Plus the Avatar 1 game was in 3D.  FWIW.",Positive
Intel,This is what I am thinking too.,Neutral
Intel,"You say that, but they specifically mentioned FSR3, and just DLSS, so i have a feeling DLSS3 will have to go via a mod again.",Neutral
Intel,"i have a believe that even 4C8T will survive for the decade, like the case of that 4790K. But turns out these newer UE5 games are wrecking even newish CPU like the 3600. i mean cmon it's still a 4 years CPU old which i think it's not old yet",Neutral
Intel,Let's hope so. 30fps is far from recommended for FSR 3,Neutral
Intel,Yeah I heard it works with that hoping it works with fsr3 now,Positive
Intel,"I've noticed that for some reason newer games look blurry at 1080 even without any kind of upscaling and I'm not sure why, older game look much sharper at 1080p",Negative
Intel,"Just lazy optimisation, that’s pretty much a PS5 equivalent GPU and you can be damn sure that the console version won’t be 1080P 30fps with FSR",Negative
Intel,"No it says 5700. NOT 5700XT, and yes there is a difference. Quite literally the difference between a 1070 and 1080ti. Or a 2070 and 2080.",Neutral
Intel,no no my 7 year old card needs to be able to play at high settings. so does my low end card from today. gotta be high or its just bad,Negative
Intel,Crazy expectation? A game released in 2023 should be able to run at 1080p low 30fps on a low end card like rx6500xt (lowest end modern card you can buy now).  Optimization matters.,Neutral
Intel,"Yup, these cards came out around the time of ps4 I think..that's a long time ago in the graphical quality of games we are seeing.  People should be happy to a point that those cards can even run some of these games if upscaling helps them run that's a bonus as it means they don't need to upgrade if those graphics settings are acceptable to them.",Positive
Intel,"I have a 5700 and it does better at 1080p on these games than what is normally posted. Now it does need quality fsr but its not the worst thing, anything lower than quality is. Bottom line is these are not 100% correct and never have been.  I have zero interest in this game but the specs seem fine even though I wish upscaling wasn't what was relied on for optimization.",Neutral
Intel,"well you dont know what they mean by 30 fps. It could be de 1% lows or the average, we dont know. The easy assumption is that it will be 30 fps average. but that's crazy that a game at 1080p low cant be run by a 5700. It better be a new Crysis.  edit: apparently it uses raytracing only for lighting which would explain the hows and why it crushes the framerate so bad especially on a gpu that doesnt have hardware raytracing like the 5700.",Negative
Intel,"Or in the case of games like Alan Wake 2, you will get unplayable fps if you try to running it at 4k native max settings. Even with a 4090, you will get a glorious 20fps.",Negative
Intel,Assassins creed origins and odyssey side quests/collectibles oh my god,Negative
Intel,Yeah it doesn't give us a actual gauge to understand what we need for set native parameters. I mentioned optimization out of concern that they rely too much on upscaling and it seems like it's the lazy way out of something. It's unrealistic that a usable gaming experience be in a top tier hardware setup that costs $2k+ and top tier hardware of just the last generation are just barely cutting it anymore.,Negative
Intel,I appreciate your insights and opinions. Thank you.,Positive
Intel,">UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  Because they market how ""good"" it looks, not how ""well"" it runs. There's a big influence from marketing perspective to place high focus on ""eye candy"", it's what sells.  The how ""well"" it runs is usually restricted to the small % of us gaming nerds. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flip_out)",Neutral
Intel,console games started upscaling way before PCs .,Negative
Intel,This sub is rife with crazy conspiracy theories. I don't think it was this insane a couple years back.,Negative
Intel,you forgot who owns one of the most popular engines out there?,Neutral
Intel,"I guess technically it would count but then everyone would flame it for looking bad. But seriouly, what happened when Ultra settings ran real smooth on top of the line hardware? Gone those times.",Negative
Intel,downvoted by devs lol,Neutral
Intel,> RTX 4080 is 50% Faster than RTX 3080.  The msrp is 71% higher too.,Positive
Intel,"Yeah at 1200 bucks and above you got one, that's true but many cards below didn't offer much.",Neutral
Intel,that's stoopid but it's somewhat more understandable. Why a 5700 would struggle so much since it doesnt have hardware raytracing,Negative
Intel,Yep it's like a 10/15% performance uplift in some games but I'd guess they would prefer to keep the requirements sheets somewhat simple.,Neutral
Intel,Why is there a dialog message about unsupported hardware when you try and run a 390X?,Negative
Intel,It can do software based RT just like every other modern GPU out there.,Neutral
Intel,Well then no wonder rx 5700 can't manage 30 fps lol,Neutral
Intel,"Wait so we are finally getting games made only with ray tracing in mind? This is actually great, 2023 is officially the year the new generation started",Positive
Intel,Avatars uses a Lumen like software RT solution.,Neutral
Intel,"yeah they never finished the sentence for some reason. The full sentences is ""its better than native, when native has forced taa!"" which is why dlaa/fsraa at native look so much better than the upscale versions. normal basic TAA is just so bad, that even upscales not using it look better than native using it",Negative
Intel,"The AA side of things might be better, but I swear no matter the resolution textures become a blurry mess even with Quality mode etc, and it irks me that most people don't seem to notice that.",Negative
Intel,Some people seem to have very low sensitivity to added blur. See also *depth of field blur* and *motion blur* being on by default in every game. It's funny how much people rage against FXAA/DoF/Motion blur but ignore DLSS.  Of course only one is tied to someone's purchasing decision :),Negative
Intel,"Yeah, thatsl happened.",Neutral
Intel,">every time I tell them that I can tell the difference between native and upscaled and it's not better then natibe they call me a liar and downvote  Well, yes, you are using shitty FSR which is literally unplayable no matter resolution instead of godly DLSS that is literally better than native even at 720p/performance. The only way you could have seen the ever unmatched DLSS for PC kings instead of the plebean FSR is through a compressed youtube video so your opinion is literally invalid. I hope I am being sarcastic enough.",Negative

Intel,"""We could"" but not profitable. Just let imagine these games does not exist in our reality.",Negative
Intel,You didn't understand. It's another Swiss knife engine,Negative
Intel,"It is indeed not a great situation. Things like this shouldn't be forced on, and it leaves me feeling like they haven't given the devs enough time to optimize the settings.",Negative
Intel,It works because most consoles players are noobs they don't care about the tech. They just want to sit on the couch and play. I'm hoping we see them start working more on FSR3 and upgrading older games to it. And you are right nvidia will keep moving forward but so will AMD. They may never catch them since they have a head start.,Positive
Intel,AMD just released drivers for Alan Wake 2 that fixed the flickering while using FSR.,Neutral
Intel,The PS5 has a 6700.,Neutral
Intel,">I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?   Not exactly. It's a custom quasi-RDNA2 design (has the improved RDNA2 compute units, but it's missing a few features such as fully-DX12-compliant mesh shaders and VRS-capable ROPs).  For most purposes, it's pretty comparable to a 6700 (non-XT), with the same number of CUs (36), and similar clockspeeds.",Neutral
Intel,"Oh, wow. I didn't know that. But it'll likely be on a similar level as UE5, right?",Positive
Intel,Next gen DOES NOT MEAN that your CURRENT GEN hardware can run it well for sure... Why don't people get that?,Negative
Intel,That reminds me to grab moss 1 and 2. I just got a quest 3.   Agreed though. I’ve been waiting for kingdom hearts 3 to come to steam for so long that I’m basically going to skip it at this point. It’s still stuck on the epic game store.,Neutral
Intel,Far cry 6 and re4 are older and or lower demanding games.  And yes any Mode here does either Hardware or Software rt from. Min to max.,Neutral

Intel,TAA,Neutral
Intel,Temporal anti aliasing.,Negative
Intel,"TAA is the devil. it forces a blur on every frame, and only gets worse as the resolution goes lower. its why fsr, xess, and dlss can look better than """"native"""" because it doesnt use the horrid plain taa solution so many games do. and why dlaa, and fsraa are so important and need to replace taa completely",Negative
Intel,"Ahh, welcome to r/FuckTAA",Neutral
Intel,Even 4K looks blurry with some implementations of TAA,Negative
Intel,they're giving you the bare minimum until your upgrade!,Neutral
Intel,Because they are built with upscaling in mind so they have a blurry looks intentionally as it works best with aggressive upscaling.,Neutral
Intel,"Not even close, you're completely out of your mind. The 5700xt is 9% faster than the 5700. The 1080ti is **32%** faster than a 1070 and the 2080 is **19%** faster than the 2070.

Intel,"The 5700 and 5700xt is more like a 1070 and 1070ti situation. It's not that big a gap, and you can close it even tighter because the majority of RX 5700 cards can be flashed to a 5700xt bios tightening the gap farther.",Negative

Intel,Those are some dumbass expectations. Maybe you should correct them instead of blaming the developers for it.,Neutral
Intel,"The 6500XT offers $200 2016 performance. In fact its often worse because of how gimped it is interface wise. Its one of the worst products released in recent years.  Its not the game developers fault AMD pretty much rebadged the RX 480 4 times and they can't be expected to sink their optimization to that level.  RX 480, RX580, RX 5500XT and RX6500XT are virtualy the same product performance wise. RX 5500XT is the most consistent one of the lot offering a somewhat more modern arhitecture in its 8GB variant. The 6500XT on the other hand while on a newer arhitecture is an unmitigated disaster that is on par at best and sinks even below the RX580 when memory, bus and PCIE interface constrained.  The console baseline is around 6700XT/2070 Super/3060ti level. People better get used to that as its gonna become or already has become the norm for 1080p high settings gaming. The 5700 is upwards of 30% slower by default while also having less hardware features. Its gonna become the minimum norm going forward alongside the 2060's of your time.",Negative
Intel,"the 1070 was 2016, the 5700 was 2019. While both not new its not 10 years old like the PS4 (2013)",Neutral
Intel,This is literally only true if you use path tracing. I think you're trying to insinuate the game is unoptimized when it just scales really high with visual features if your hardware supports it. It straight up runs great for the visual features it uses.,Positive
Intel,"That was exclusive to console releases, no? And never to the point of replacing AA sharpening and rendering the game from 720p…",Neutral
Intel,No I havent. AMD is bigger than Epic.,Negative
Intel,"Right, you'll have different complaints but complaints none the less even though the new Ultra might still look slightly better prior gen games and offer high FPS but people would complain that the graphics are not advancing fast enough, they look the same etc etc.  Yah those days are likely gone but it's hard to say if it's because the game is unoptimized or if the dev is really pushing the limits of what they can do graphically and use upscaling as a buffer because what they have in mind, or what they intend to show is too taxing for current hardware. We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it. This is why I've never in my life ever pre-ordered a game. I still don't understand why people do it (esp now that games are digital) but lot of people do. Then again I've never really paid for a ""skin"" or some other visual add-on so maybe that's what attracts people.  I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets. The presets are all relative anyways. There's no universal settings that define what each preset represents.  I just don't get the outrage on these minimum spec sheets compared to what the game is showing graphically. At least wait until it releases and we have some hard data.",Negative
Intel,"I'm also a dev dood sometimes it's literally a ""foutage de geugle"" I had a friend who talk about how shit devs in EA (the people who's making the engine) code and doesn't optimise",Negative
Intel,"The commenter I replied to said there wasn't a big generational improvement for GPUs, while I said there was. But I agree that 4080 is expensive for what it offers.",Neutral
Intel,It was the same price as a 3090 at launch and offers 90% more performance.  It was definitely a generational leap.,Positive
Intel,It's software ray tracing which isn't accelerated by hardware.,Neutral
Intel,and i guess it can be hard to tell if ram is dual or single rank with just two sticks of it too.,Neutral
Intel,>might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.  I was pointing out that 1070 doesn't have hardware RT either.,Negative
Intel,So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?,Negative
Intel,"Why not make it toggleable though, you can choose other graphics settings so it makes no sense. Most people don't play games with RT enabled",Negative
Intel,Still kinda weird that they put the RX 5700/A750 on the same ballpark as the 1070... Being that the newer GPUs actually perform closer to a 1080(Ti).,Neutral
Intel,Sounds like improperly configured negative LOD bias. If you have Nvidia you can fix it with nvinspector. On AMD there's nothing you can do IIRC if Devs mess it up.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly what I'm telling them all the time, that I can see difference in textures, in hair, fences, powerlines etc. And every time I get downvoted by the army of ""but it looks better then native"". I feel like majority of that sub needs to go get a prescription for new glasses",Negative
Intel,"So if you stopped measuring who's bigger, why do you think I have no access to DLSS? Tested on rig with 4080 on a C2 42"" screen. Once you stop thinking with the tip of your head where probably Nvidia's logo is tattooed or maybe Jensen's face, who knows, you could come to realization that one person have access to more hardware then only his personal rig.  Do I say that FSR is better then DLSS? No! Both of them have their issues, but none of them is better then native. Keep on fanboying mate, instead of providing normal convoy as grownups",Neutral
Intel,I don't think YOU understand what you're talking about.  Did you seriously expect Snowdrop to be something used in like one game and then discarded completely?,Negative
Intel,"The thing is: creating good looking lightning with RT is much easier than with prebaked illumination. I can fully understand, why developers of new games are using RT as the basis of their game.",Positive
Intel,Minimum requirements go up as games get/look better. They probably made this game with the series s as the minimum. Low settings probably looks better than high in most games.   Rt for the last few years has been added on top of already complete games. Now games are being made with rt as the standard and they would have to manually do a ton of extra work to support 7+ year old hardware. It's the same as having to drop support for last gen consoles to be able to deliver a better game.,Neutral
Intel,"And still - superior upscaling makes it worth paying extra, RT on higher end is worth paying extra. AMD even this gen doesn't undercut price by enough, especially in EU where power efficiency also play a role. For example, assuming I'm gonna use GPU for 2 gens, then I save ~90-100€ with my usage just on electricity alone. I know it's over period of 4 years, but still it's price difference that will recoup over time, even if I have to pay extra upfront. AMD is simply no longer a value proposition.",Neutral
Intel,"They did not, lol - that fixes completely different thing, not the FSR caused shimmering edges.",Negative
Intel,Both excellent 👌 Down the Rabbit Hole was another solid one.,Positive
Intel,"RE4 came out this year.  Anyway the difference between us is I don't think any lighting effect is worth a $1,000 GPU using 1080p resolution and 60fps, but I know many disagree. That's life.",Neutral
Intel,"3600 and the 3300x was built with the TSMC 7nm if i recall, that was 2018 cutting edge tech. and somehow in gaming it's already obsolete. i was planning to replace mine with 5700x  but i cancel it because it's still very much capable for what i do now. but now after UE5 i think i'll reconsider it again, maybe even as far as 5800X3D",Neutral
Intel,It is crazy that I see everyone saying that modern games look blurry. I've known for years taa does this but it seems like I see more people than ever dissatisfied by it.,Negative
Intel,I have to turn it off in borderlands 3. Ugh.,Neutral
Intel,r/FuckTAA,Neutral
Intel,"My friend nicknamed it after his eyesight. When he wears glasses he has 20/20, but when he doesn’t he says that he sees the image about the same as without glasses",Neutral
Intel,"Out of curiosity what resolution do you usually game at and at what distance? I find taa usually looks pretty good in modern games, but I'm also playing on a TV (48 inches but I'm not at monitor distance anymore). When I played on my 1920x1200 monitor I HATED TAA, well, not as much as fxaa, but moreso than smaa, and I missed msaa or SGSSAA with a passion. Now on the TV at 4k (lol, usually not on a 6700xt), 1440p, or even 1080p I find TAA can do a pretty decent job paired with varying levels of the Radeon sharpness adjustment in the adrenaline drivers. But again, probably due to viewing distance.  Looks leagues better than FXAA and I prefer it to SMAA now. But again, I'm sitting further away and tweaking sharpening to my liking. FSR2 seems to be a wash most of the time but the performance gain is worth it.",Positive
Intel,You dumbass do understand that even the console version of the recent games are total mess? Alan wake 2 have to run on reduced settings to even reach 30fps on xbox/PS. Callisto protocol used to have frametime issue on consoles. Console ports still targets 30fps on quality settings with upscaling while target should be 60fps with 120fps for performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, seems you are correct, it was the ps4 pro that came out in 2016, still, I wouldn't expect that to be capable of running some of the games we are seeing now without some serious compromises.",Neutral
Intel,I never said that Alan Wake 2 is unoptimised. I just said that even a 4090 can’t max out the game at native 4K resolution.,Negative
Intel,epic is tencent...,Neutral
Intel,"In terms of absolute numbers sure, 3090 always had a stupid price tho for being 10% faster than a 3080.   In terms of performance per dollar the 4090 even at 2x 3080 performance was worse value since you pay 1600 not 1400.",Negative
Intel,"Yes, you either have to get the spec sheet of the RAM modules (That even then it may not specify if it's a single/dual rank module) or test it in a system and use HWinfo/CPU-Z. Not as straightforward as dual channel that's mostly just using two identical modules.",Neutral
Intel,You don't need RT hardware to do software RT. That's what I'm saying.,Neutral
Intel,"For this particular game, there is a software fallback. Also, even if we did get a game that mandated hardware support for RT they'd still likely build it with console in mind so even RDNA2 GPUs shouldn't have issues",Neutral
Intel,"The first RT/DLSS capable cards are 5 years old now, way older than the current consoles. You are definitely not being left behind if you're only outdated by 1 gen lol",Neutral
Intel,I mean the last non ray tracing cards were released 4 years ago (1650/60 and 5000s from AMD),Neutral
Intel,Games running poorly on computers weaker than current gen consoles isn't exactly anything new.,Negative
Intel,"No, you have multiple generations of games from prior to raytracing to enjoy.  Games shouldn't be held back forever just because someone wants to game on a GeForce2 MX400.",Neutral
Intel,You are stuck playing older games. Unless someone can find a way to disable it with a mod.,Negative
Intel,> So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?  A gen old is second gen RT e.g. rtx 3000.  We're halfway through the third RT/matrix generation right now.,Negative
Intel,Yes hah,Neutral
Intel,"The 3090 or 6950xt will very likely run this game extremely well, they're a gen old.",Positive
Intel,"For the AMD GPU, it's probably because minimum will be the max it will support. Medium probably requires Hardware RT.  For Intel, I don’t know. Perhaps it signal not so great optimization for Intel GPUs...",Neutral
Intel,DLSS is very strong in thin lines like fences & hair. Much better than most TAA solutions. Not sure about FSR in general.  An example: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6erA6BVkAAuf_M?format=jpg&name=large  Only DLSS resolves the lines properly.,Positive
Intel,"I mean, it's not that black and white. Quality upscaling to 1080 will obviously be more noticeable than 4k. Maybe you *can* tell the difference between 4k native and dlss quality, but people aren't gonna believe you unless you prove it with some kind of blind test, but I doubt you'd be willing to go out of your way to do that.  Even if you could, the benefits of better aa might outweight some negligible drop in textures or whatever it is upscaling reduces. Though that's irrelevant when DLAA or NAA are options too, I guess.",Neutral
Intel,"Test, which one looks better, explain.  https://imgsli.com/MjE3MzEy",Neutral
Intel,Oh man the hair... its so crazy how much upscaling kills the hair..,Negative
Intel,i mean they already arent the smartest bulbs considering they went team green.,Neutral
Intel,Reading comrehension dude.,Neutral
Intel,"I do, but thanks for your interest.",Positive
Intel,That will depend on the user. Power is cheap here in canada so none of thar factors into my buying decisions. And rt will depends on the games you play also not everyone plays tripple a games.,Neutral
Intel,"You need to get 23.20.17.05.  Fixed Issues Intermittent flicker may be observed on some textures while playing Alan Wake 2.  Fixed for most people, also has a nice performance boost of about 10fps from what I'm seeing.  That being said I always prefer native resolution unless absolutely necessary. So far only had to use it in Martha is Dead.",Positive
Intel,Nice. It’s on the list. Thanks man,Positive
Intel,Yes.... 7nm was but 4 cores the actual important thing was obsolete like 10 or 12 years ago.,Neutral
Intel,Probably because TAA is (unfortunately) more prevalent than it ever was.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, most people are FINE with it. Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  The thing is, you have sharpening filters today. You can adjust the sharpening for TAA. You can make it look oversharpened if you want. There's driver level sharpening for both AMD and NVIDIA. Both also have software sharpening filters.  And DLSS and FSR bot have sharpening sliders.  There's 3 ways to adjust how blurry and how sharp the game looks for everyone. It's a non issue and even Digital Foundry acknowledges the benefits of TAA for game devs vs things like the blur. At the end of the day, these games are looking great...in this era, with exceptions. Not all games are blur. The whole blur thing was like in the past 4 years since upscalers started and TAA became the norm. But with all the sharpening options, and with devs actually used to making TAA not so soft looking, things are definitely getting a lot better for TAA.",Neutral
Intel,Oh my bad if I read that wrong,Negative
Intel,And I'm saying 1070 doesn't have hardware RT so it's just as gimped as AMD cards when doing RT.,Negative
Intel,Still pretty annoying nonetheless. Until it's stable no way should it be forced upon a game when someone's willing to run it normally at native.,Negative
Intel,"and the 2080ti is still winning, best purchase in gpu i made in a long time.",Positive
Intel,imagine being mad that 4 year old cards arent high end,Neutral
Intel,I'm on a 6700XT. 🙇. I just feel very shocked that I would probably need a gpu upgrade soon. With the demands of new games. Also 1440p ruined me.,Negative
Intel,"Technically makes sense, but they can just make RT something you can toggle between Software/Hardware and they also could just add the Vega 56 in the requirement sheet being that was AMD's competitor to the 1070 or they could've added the GTX 1080(Ti)/RTX 2060(Super) into the sheet.  On Intel's side they only have the A580 as the closest GPU to a 1070, even when it's too similar to the A750 performance wise :/",Neutral
Intel,"It is that black and white for me. I can immediately see the added image softness from upscaling, and it's especially prevalent with DLSS 2.5+ unless you enable a sharpening filter. DLAA also has weird issues like blurring textures (almost like it reverts to initial mipmap) while moving, usually at mid-distance from camera. It's too distracting and I have to go back to regular TAA. Immediately goes away.  1440p to 2160p is better than 720p to 1080p, but it's still noticeable. Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible? No. Actually changing monitor resolution outside of native and having all UI elements scaled looks terrible. That was what we used to do and upscaling is much better than that alternative. LCD panels need to stay at native signal resolution and GPU should scale render resolutions.",Negative
Intel,"And you look at static image all the time while gaming? It's different story when movement is involved, that's where you find all the artefacts you get. Static image doesn't tell a thing when it comes to gaming",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, and that's driving me crazy. I really couldn't stand it in Cyberpunk (in other titles it's either hit or miss), that I play it in native 4k instead.",Neutral
Intel,"Wouldn't phrase it like that tough. I had that choice too in January, and actually by going 4070Ti instead of 7900XT I would be able to play Cyberpunk in higher fidelity and better frames then on mine, because AMD cooked FSR3.0 almost a year in the oven, and God knows how long it will take for CDPR to add it to the game, if ever considering that active development on game is ended and they are on bug fixing sprint right now. Also AMD needs to fix FSR in general, because how it works with smaller details like hair and fences is awful. But don't get me wrong, I love my card, just feel I git sold on features that would come handy right kow instead of when I don't need them anymore",Neutral
Intel,"Sorry mate, guess I need to read comments early morning instead of late night, just saw that last bit. My apologies. I'm just tired of upscalare wars whatever sub I go, and green team fanboys screaming that ""FSR is shit, DLSS is better then native"" and then throwing around static images for comparison",Negative
Intel,"It's for textures, not object edges from FSR use, lol. Two completely different things",Neutral
Intel,"people echoing the same shit like ""ooh 4C is obsolete, you need to upgrade that geriatric cpu"". 4C is still solid for gaming (ofc no UE5) and literally anything beside doing compute intensive professional workloads.",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening makes the image less blurry, but it doesn't recover the texture detail lost from TAA blur.",Negative
Intel,"""Even Nvidia foundry""   \---   they are like chief proponents of blur-tech and they don't care about how sharp and easy-to-see the image is. TAA flattens the image so you can't see which objects are far and which are near, you have to strain your eyes and mind to determine that which is unbearable to many. Just give us option to disable it even if it breaks some effects (which is just lazy thing to do on the side of devs)",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening fixes blur, not clearity. That is TAA destroys+add significant ghosting no matter the implementation.      Sharpening looks was worse than the normal cleairy of games, it's not the same thing at all.      >Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  We are mad because it being forced 1 and 2 it's being used to hide lazy effects that break without temporal frame smearing. People are now punished for turning off forced frame smearing.",Negative
Intel,And I'm saying that maybe the GTX 1070 is better at even software RT compared to AMD cards with no RT hardware. GTX 10 series card did get RTX support through CUDA even though they were horribly bad at it. Older AMD cards with no RT hardware didn't get any support like that from AMD.,Neutral
Intel,"You're not forced to use upscaling though. Unless you replied to the wrong person this is about ray tracing, which can be run at native just fine. If your GPU can't handle RT at native res, then just use upscaling.",Neutral
Intel,The minimum requirements for this game includes de 1070: a 7-year-old gpu from 2016.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm not really shocked, and was out there telling people not to buy those cards on day 1 in large part because of their deficiencies in RT performance and complete lack of matrix accelerators (which Nvidia and Intel have both made a large part of their architecture and got shockingly good results with - DLSS and matrix-XeSS are twice as good as FSR)",Negative
Intel,5700 was probably the lowest AMD card they had to test with.,Neutral
Intel,"It also looks better in gameplay, less ghosting, less shimmering, less aliasing.   So which one looks better? You clearly see the difference in textures/fences/powerline, right?  I even made it easier for you, both images are 1080p output.",Positive
Intel,I personally didn't try DLSS even once but FSR 2.0 does have shimmering I notice to various degrees. It was very noticable on fur in Ratchet & Clank cutscenes for example. Overall I am just happy my 5700xt could still keep up with 1440p.,Neutral
Intel,Hmm yeah whatever you want to believe and let's you sleep.  Have a nice day.,Positive
Intel,AMD CAS is aimed to restore detail,Neutral
Intel,"They aren’t chief proponents of anything, TAAU has been popular for well over a decade at this point and it’s the default approach for consoles (checkerboarding has moire and aliasing issues) and digital foundry simply recognizes this is the reality of how the console world has settled on doing graphics.",Neutral
Intel,The problem with Nvidia is they are massively overpriced. One 4080 would probably cost the same as my whole build or more.,Negative
Intel,"Yes I see which one looks better, and as I said before it's a static image. While I didn't use upscaling in this same exact example, I can go by my own experience and tell that it doesn't look better then native let's say in same Cyberpunk or any other game. And I will beleive my own eyes on my own screen then static images tossed around. TBH, in my opinion it all depends on screen and screen size too, as to me that difference between upscaled and native was less noticible on my old 27"" 1440p screen then it is now on 42"" 4k. DLAA tough, that's another story",Neutral
Intel,"I tried both, and neither of them are better then native as people tend to claim. In my testing FSR have big problem with smaller details like hair, fur, fences, powerlines and as you mentioned, you get severe shimmering effect. I really hope AMD will keep on working on it, an try to get away from that. But DLSS also adds shimmer, it's just less visible then in FSR (atleast in my testing on Cyberpunk pre 2.0), and whatever upscaling method I've used I also could see that image is upscaled (lower res textures here and there etc.). I like idea being upscaling tech, it helps prolong life of GPUs, and for more powerful GPUs to run higher settings with more fidelity, but there's still work to do on them as they aren't perfect yet.",Negative
Intel,Yeah but a 3060ti didn't,Neutral
Intel,"In Cyberpunk you are not comparing upscaling vs no upscaling at the same settings though. You are comparing low RT native vs path traced upscaling and at 4K, the decission there is absolutely clear. On my 4k OLED screen, upscaled PT is so clearly the way to go, there is no competition.",Negative
Intel,"The gameplay looks exactly like the image + your typical TAA/DLSS smearing. And as I said, in my example DLSS also looks better in gameplay, because as you see... native has a ton of aliasing which is super noticeable while playing (shimmering). There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling. Talking about native is nonesense, just image quality counts and thats were DLSS or even FSR 2 (some games) gets better and better. There is a reason why consoles use it... it looks better than without it.",Positive

Intel,"I mean, Path tracing is to Ray tracing, what Ray tracing is too rasterization.",Neutral
Intel,When Cyberpunk first came out the 3090 only got 20 fps in RT Psycho mode.  https://tpucdn.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-founders-edition/images/cyberpunk-2077-rt-3840-2160.png  Still does  Fast forward just one gem and you don't see anyone saying its demanding with many able to get RT Psycho on thier cards as new cards got faster.  Give it 2 gens and you are going to get 4k60 here.  Gpu will improve and get faster.,Neutral
Intel,"Look at that, my 6700XT is just 19fps slower than the RTX 4090 in this title.",Negative
Intel,It's a good thing nobody has to actually play it native.,Positive
Intel,Well good thing literally nobody is doing that…,Negative
Intel,The future is not in native resolution so this is really pointless information.  Cyberpunk looks absolutelt mindblowlingy insane with all the extra graphical bells and whistles it has gotten over the years and with Nvidia’s technology it runs so damn smooth as well.,Positive
Intel,4.3fps lol. No amount of upscaling is going to fix that and make it playable. People were saying the 7900xtx had 3090ti levels of RT when it launched. A 4060 ti is 50% faster then it.,Negative
Intel,That's actually pretty amazing for any GPU to get a metric in frames per second instead of minuites per frame.,Positive
Intel,"Meh I get like 90+ fps with everything cranked with RR, FG and DLSS(Balanced) toggled on with my 4090 @ 4k.  Path tracing does introduce ghosting which is annoying buts not really noticeable most times but at the same time with RR enabled it removes shimmering on 99% of objects that is normally introduced with DLSS so I am willing to compromise.   Honestly as someone who used to have a 7900XTX I am disappointed with AMD its clear that AI tech in gaming is the way forward and they just seem so far behind Nvidia now and even Intel(going by some preview stuff). FSR is just not even comparable anymore.",Negative
Intel,Who cares when it looks worse than with dlss and ray reconstruction on top of running a lot worse? Native res 4k is pointless.,Negative
Intel,"Well the upscaling in this game is really good, DLSS with ray reconstructions AI accelerated denoiser provides better RT effects than the game at native with its native Denoiser.  Also Path tracing scales perfectly with resolution so upscaling provides massive gains. using DLSS quality doubles performance to 40fps, and dlss balanced gives 60fps on average, performance about 70-80 or 4x native 4K, that includes the 10-15% performance gain RR gives as well over the native denoiser as well.  I've been playing with about 60fps on average 50-70. with DLSS Balanced and RR and its been amazing. I don't like frame gen tho since it causes VRR flickers on my screen",Positive
Intel,"Running Ray Tracing or Path Tracing without DLSS or Ray Reconstruction is like intentionally going into a battlefield without any gear whatsoever, it's absolutely pointless and suicidal, what we can clearly see here though is top of the line 7900 XTX losing against already mediocre mid-range 4060 Ti by over 50%, which is just beyond embarrassing for AMD Radeon.  All this says to me is AMD Radeon need to get their shit together and improve their RT / PT performance, otherwise they will continue to lose more Marketshare on GPU department no matter how hard their fanboys thinks that they are pointless features, just like DLSS was back on 2020 right?  Also, with my 4070 Ti OC i can run it at average of over 60 FPS at 1440p DF optimized settings with DLSS Balanced + Ray Reconstruction without even using DLSS Frame Gen, with it on i can get over 80+ FPS",Negative
Intel,Running this way means you lose RR…why in the world would you run at native 4k?  It’s completely pointless now with RR.,Negative
Intel,Im having 80 fps  thanks to dlss 3.5  and its looking better than ever,Positive
Intel,"Why would I run native? I have amazing DLSS, ray reconstruction for huge image gains and frame gen. Nvidia offering all the goodies.",Positive
Intel,"I have a 13900KF-4090 rig and a 7800X3D-7900XTX rig. They are connected to a C2 OLED and to a Neo G9.  I've been holding on to play the game till 2.0 update. I've tried many times with different ray-tracing options and they all look good and all. But in the end I closed them all, turned back to Ultra Quality without ray-tracing and started playing the game over 120FPS.  This is a good action fps game now. I need high fps with as low latency as possible. So who cares about ray-tracing and path-tracing.  Yeah ray-tracing and path-tracing are good. But we are at least 2-3 generations away for them to become mainstream. When they are easily enabled on mid-range gpus with high-refresh rate monitors, they will be good and usable then :)",Positive
Intel,"If you have the HW, go all out. That's why we spend on these things.  I'm getting the best experience you can get in the premiere visual showcase of a good game.   It's path tracing. It isn't cheap but the fact that we have DLSS and FG with Ray reconstruction is a Godsend. It looks stunning and it's still early in development.",Positive

Intel,"""Get Nvidia if you want a good ray tracing experience""  Yes Nvidia GPUs give a better ray tracing experience but is it really worth it if you are required to turn on DLSS? Imo, the more AI-upscaling you have to turn on, the worse the Nvidia purchase is.   I have a 6900XT and I will readily admit that the RT experience (ultra RT, no path tracing) at native 1080p resolution is ok, like 30-45 FPS (around 50 on medium RT settings), but if I turn RT lighting off (so RT shadows, sunlight, and reflections are still present) suddenly I get pretty consistent 60 FPS (i left my frames tied to monitor refresh rate, so 60 FPS is my max) and i can't tell the damn difference at native 1080p compared to RT medium or Ultra.   So would I spend another $400-$1000 to get an imperceptible outcome (imperceptible to me that is)? Most definitely not.",Negative

Intel,Sounds like Ray tracing isn’t ready for prime if nothing can run it and you have to use AI smoke and mirrors to fake it playable.

Intel,"It's way too early for using ray / path tracing in games comfortably, maybe in 10 years it'll be different, but for the foreseeable future I'm more than happy with normal rasterization.",Neutral
Intel,Who cares tho? Its not even the way it's meant to be ran. This tech is is a synergy. No point in trying to 'flex' native at this point. A 4090 gets very high FPS and amazing visuals when doing things right.,Negative
Intel,can wait in 2030 with the 8030RTX low profile 30 watt card run this game with full path tracing in 4k 120fps lol (in 2030 a low end card will run this like butter don't down vote me because you didn't get it lol),Negative
Intel,"Seems like this tech is only around to give Nvidia a win. Also path and ray tracing doesn’t always look better. If the one true God card can’t run it, is it reasonable tech or is it a gimmick? Especially seeing how like no one has a 4090. Like a very small percentage of PC gamers have one. Most aren’t even spending $1600 on their whole build!",Negative
Intel,What body part do you think will get me a 5090?,Neutral
Intel,"Once they introduced this dlss upscaling anti-lag all these gimmicks I don't think we've seen true 4K native and almost anything lately.  This is maybe one game that does look that good but many of the games don't look that great and have some really serious system requirements when there are games that look much better and are much better optimized.  Companies are taking shortcuts, instead of optimizing they give you suboptimal and use FSR dlss all these gimmicks.  Don't get me wrong I always thought it was great for people who wanted to reach a certain frames per second someone with a weaker system to allow them to play at least the minimal at a steady frame rate.  It just seems like this is the normal now non-optimized games.  The 4090 is a beast if you could only get about 20 frames native with Ray tracing it tells you everything you need to know about Ray tracing.  It needs to be reworked that needs to be a new system I believe one real engine has it built in in a certain way probably not as good as Ray tracing directly.  To me it seems like ray tracing is hampering many games that tried to add it, too much focus on that instead of actual making a good game.  Let's daisy chain 4 4090s ..gets 60 fps.. and then house goes on fire!  Obviously I'm being sarcastic but realistically it's actually pretty sad a 4090 20 frames per second.",Negative

Intel,Lmfao ... where are all those nvidia fan boys who prefer eye-candy path trace over 60fps?,Neutral
Intel,Sounds like some efficient tech. Lmao. What's the fucking point if it makes the game unplayable? RT just washes out the image and looks like shit. Kills the contrast. Can't wait for this fad to end,Negative
Intel,In my opinion it's too early for Ray / path tracing it's computationally expensive and if you are using rasterization at ultra settings not only does look nearly identical but it's easier to do the work for the graphics and that gives you more fps...,Negative
Intel,"Rather than having 2-3fps, I would go and see a video of path tracing.",Neutral
Intel,"Does this fact really matter tho? Dlss in cyberpunk is known the look on par or even better than native, frame generation will further smooth it out. I can definitely see the 7900xtx being able to do path tracing at 1440p at least once amd release fsr 3 and better once they release something to now match ray reconstruction which also give a small boost in fps making path tracing even more doable.",Positive

Intel,Do we need this BS? Seriously? Gpu’s will end-up costing over 2 grand soon,Negative
Intel,I don't even get the hype around ray tracing most games don't have it and when they do it either makes the game look blurry or isn't noticeable unless you're in a weirdly lit area or looking at a reflection,Negative
Intel,"Am replaying it with a 6950xt and a 7700k(defo bottleneck).  All maxed out(no RT) at 1440p. If I wanted 4k I would have to enable FSR.  Its completely playable imo.   Mostly 50-60fps.  For me RT vs off vs path tracing.   The game doesn't look more real or better, it just looks different.  But ignorance is bliss.",Positive
Intel,This chart is bull. Since when is a RTX 3060 faster than a 3080. Someone needs to seriously question the source of the chart,Negative

Still, the game is not playable without upscaling at 4K with Path Tracing, so the basis of the sentiment remains correct.

Then you have all the UE5 and path trace type demos where a 4090 is only getting 60fps with upscaling.. at 1080p lol.   We are not remotely ready for these technologies yet.

They had tessellation maps under the ground and water in Crysis that were doing nothing other than tanking AMD (ATi) performance. I am not saying this whole Cyberpunk thing is exactly the same, but it's essentially similar. In all honesty, turning everything up to 11 on my 3090 doesn't net much visual gain beyond some mirror like reflections and nothing I really care about when actually playing the game (compared to standard High/Ultra) and not pixel peeping, which seems to be the new game now for people buying expensive GPUs, so they can justify their purchase.

Intel,"Most likely there will be no gpu that supports path tracing and gives you native 4k 120fps in 5 years, maybe even in 10 years.  The technology has slowed down a bit. It’s increasingly more challenging to make more dense chips.  That’s why Intel has been struggling for many years already and every iteration of their cpus gives only minor improvements. AMD went with chiplets but this approach has its own problems.  Nvidia stands out only because of AI.

Intel,TRUE! i think 5-10 years was the actual point in time where anybody should have paid their hard earned dollar for raytracing gpus. instead ppl dished out $1000s for the RTX2080/Ti and now are sitting on them waiting for raytracing to happen for them xD,Neutral
Intel,Who knows what new tech will be out in even 4 years lol,Neutral

Intel,"...but will cost your everlasting soul, body, firstborn and parents. If it's on sale.",Neutral
Intel,It is path trancing though. The technology used by Pixar to make Toy Story 4 (though they spent up to 1200 CPU hours for one frame) Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story. And they had their supercomputers working on it. It is a miracle of modern technology that it even runs real time.,Positive
Intel,"You basically need a 4090 to crack 60 fps at 1440p w/ dlss on quality without frame gen. It looks good, but not good enough to run out and buy a 4090.",Negative

Intel,"The 7900xtx is one of the worst gpus iv ever had lol on paper it looks so so good, In games it just play isn’t. Fsr is garbage, 4080 mops the floor with it :( plus the drivers from amd besides starfield have been awful this generation",Negative
Intel,I think that most of the progress will go together with software tricks and upscalers.,Neutral

Intel,"Not exactly. Path tracing is just ray tracing, but cranked up to 99% with the least amount of rasterization possible.",Neutral
Intel,"> Give it 2 gens and you are going to get 4k60 here.  Assuming the 5090 literally doubles a 4090 (unlikely), that only gets us to 4K 40hz.  Assuming a 6090 doubles that, 80. which won't be bad.  Going with more conservative 50% boosts. 5090 will give 30. 6090 will give 45.  And i feel like 50% is being very generous, as nvidia have claimed moores law is dead and they can't advance beyond a 4090 by much. I'd guess we get 30% uplift in 5090 and maybe 10-15% uplift in 6090. So we'd still be under 4K30.",Neutral
Intel,Imagine buying a 4090 and then using upscaling.,Neutral
Intel,Path tracing is so much more demanding than ray tracing due to light scattering being modelled. It is a marvel it even runs.,Negative
Intel,PC gaming is in Crysis.,Neutral

Intel,You're the first other person other than myself I've run into that had an XTX but ended up with a 4090 in the end.,Neutral
Intel,"Plus frame generation works very well in Cyberpunk in terms of image quality. In some games, you need to get closer to ~80 fps output for an acceptable image quality with FG. But the FG in CP2077 is decent with 60 fps output, ~~and I get ~65-70 fps output with quality DLSS + FG at 4k on a 4090.~~ EDIT: I misremembered what I was getting. With path tracing, DLSS quality, frame generation, and ray reconstruction, I got 80.1 fps with the benchmark!  Of course there's the matter of latency, and the latency of CP2077 with FG output of ~65-70 fps isn't great. So I'll often use DLSS balanced + FG. Thanks to ray reconstruction, this now looks very close enough native 4k (to my eyes), with acceptable latency (to me), at a high framerate output.",Positive
Intel,"Nvidia features are always useless until AMD copies them a year or two later, only then they become great features 😁",Positive
Intel,"Tbh, list the games that have ray tracing right now. Pretty few.  It's not about being a fanboy of amd, but ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick, not because it's unnoticeable or bad, just because it's not ""popular"" (I myself really like it). I would personally go amd over nvidia because those 50 or so euros more that nvidia has against the amd counter parts simply are too much for just better rt and  dlss. I could spend those for a better amd card with generally better performance.  Regarding dlss, personally I would just lower the graphics before resorting to kinda bad generated frames, fsr even worse. But that's my point of view.  I find that amd still has to fix some driver issues but other than that, they are a fine brand. (so is nvidia)",Neutral
Intel,Yeh because native 4k looks worse than dlss + RR 4k,Negative
Intel,"Yeah the game with DLSS, RR and path tracing at 1440p looks amazing and with very high fps",Positive
Intel,What's the point of having $5000 PC when you're still gonna have literally the same graphics as $1000 PC then?,Negative
Intel,"This is a tech demo. That's the whole point. It's not really playable yet, but the game really is meant to showcase what is possible in the future and how close we are getting. That's what Nvidia is doing here by funding this whole project.  Crysis who many people are comparing this to, was in itself quite revolutionary for its time. The destructible environment in Crysis to this day holds up, and that was it's killer feature really.  You're gonna have swings at the future that miss as well, and that's ok.",Positive

Intel,Yep hahaha,Neutral
Intel,RemindMe! 7 years,Neutral
Intel,"No, this tech is around so game developers can sell more copies of their games by making them look better. The only reason why Nvidia is winning is because their GPUs are much better at intensive ray-tracing.",Positive
Intel,"This is an absurd, fanboyish thought lmao",Negative
Intel,dont let novidia marketing see this youll get down voted into oblivion,Negative
Intel,I would still argue it's still in proof of concept stage. The tech will only become viable once the flagship GPU'S start getting 4k 60fps at native. That will the allow the lower end GPU'S to get 4k 60 or 1440p 60 upscaled.,Neutral
Intel,I mean I have no problem playing at 30fps dlss balance at 1080p DF optimized settings on a 2080ti with pathtracing idc what anyone says RT/PT is the future it just looks so much better than Rasterization,Positive
Intel,"Possibly a little more. Assuming that the leaked 1.7x improvement is right and path tracing performance scales the same, that would be about 34 fps at 4k native. Might be possible to hit 60fps or close to it with DLSS Quality.",Neutral
Intel,It could as well do 60fps if Nvidia adds a lot of path tracing HW into the GPU.,Neutral
Intel,Fanboyism of both kinds is bad,Negative
Intel,"It won't end, but hopefully we see games that have art designed with RT lighting and reflections in mind.  Cyberpunk isn't it. We'd need a full rebuild of the game, every location, every asset and surface remade, so it looks like originally intended by the artists.",Neutral
Intel,Since it needs more than 10gb vram,Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is more optimized than majority of games that came out in last two years. Just because you can't run it at 4k 120 fps with path tracing doesn't mean it's not optimized.,Negative
Intel,It’s not unoptimized at all. Game runs great for the quality of the graphics. You guys just don’t understand the insane amount of power path tracing takes. The fact you can do it at all rn is insane but once again people just throw “unoptimized” at it because they don’t understand the technical marvel happening in front of their eyes.,Negative
Intel,"No, this game is actually very well optimized. It's just extremely demanding at 4k native, which is why DLSS exists.  It would be unoptimized if it ran like this while looking like nothing special, but this is probably the game with the best graphics, period. At the very least, it's certainly the game with the best lighting.",Positive
Intel,"and people will be like ""well RT is the future""  raster was fine for over 15 years and raster games look great but we get it we must let incompetent game devs and their bosses make shit quality games because average gamer is ready to spend $100 to pre-order electronic version of horse shit and then justify it for years because they can't admit they wasted money",Negative
Intel,It's settled that you have no idea what you talking about,Negative
Intel,Its full path tracing u cannot really optimize this much.,Negative
Intel,"It always did. Most games don't scale well, Cyberpunk does.  Look at the last two years of pc ports and you will understand how cyberpunk looks and performs like it's black magic.",Neutral
Intel,"Baked illumination requires you to choose where to add light sources and how the lighting is applied to everything, it's a creative choice of the author, the AI needs instructions to know what to do, so it would need constant handholding, on the other hand RT uses simple physics to calculate how light bounced and NN to apply the light on surfaces.",Neutral
Intel,But the destructable environment and the water graphics and other things in Direct X 9 made high end pcs kneel as well.  I remember playing on my 9800gtx/+ with my Intel Q9300 quad core (lapped and oc'ed to 3.0ghz - EDIT: checked some old evga posts got it to 3.33ghz) with 2x4gigs DDR2 @1000mhz cas 5 trying to maintain a sustained 30fps at 900p resolution on my 1680x1050 monitor. And I oc'ed the crap out of that 9800gtx 835 mhz (cant recall if it was unlinked shadder or not now) core on blower air (won the silicon lottery with that evga card).  Tweaking settings was mostly user done and guided with old school limited forum help. Ahh the good old days of having lots of time during school breaks.,Neutral
Intel,"The equivalent of a 4090 at the time, 8800 ultra (768MB) got 7.5 fps at 1920x1200 very high quality. The other cards were not able to run it. Even the lowest tier last generation card runs this, even though it's at 5% speed.",Neutral
Intel,No and no again lol  The 8800gtx could do 1152x864 high and that was the top dog. DX9 cards could do that at medium but high shaders was like a 25fps average tops and that dropped into the teens on the snow level.   It took things like the gtx480 and HD 6970 to do 1920x1080 30fps max settings. That's before getting into Sandy Bridge being the first cpu that could sustain 40+ fps if the gpu power was there.   Crysis came during the core 2 duo/k8 athlon and first wave dx10 cards era and it took *2 more generations* of *both* gpus and cpus to do it some justice.,Neutral

Intel,"> Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story  Toy Story didn't use path tracing though, A Bug's Life was Pixar's first movie to use ray tracing (not path tracing) and only for a few frames in the entire movie for specific reflections, they started using ray tracing more generally for Cars and I can't find exactly when they started using path tracing but it should be around the early 2010s which is also when the other Disney animation studios started using path tracing",Neutral
Intel,No it's not a miracle. Because it's downscaled a lot and also uses lower quality math and piggybacking on AI to make up for it. It's basically running through 3 layers of cheats to produce results that aren't that much better than just traditional raster.,Negative
Intel,"That’d be some next level consumerism, paying 1500$ minimum to turn on a single setting in a single game just to play it wayyyyy slower than you would otherwise",Negative
Intel,"Hell playing path tracing with my 2080ti at 25 FPS is still looks absolutely fantastic, I would absolutely play with pathtracing on a 4090 constantly. Idc dlss looks great with RR even at 1080p. I won’t upgrade for another year or 2 (just bought a phone so I’m broke right now)",Positive
Intel,4090 getting 60fps at 4k balanced dlss with no frame gen. 100 with frame gen. I can make it drop into the 20s if I stand right next to a fire with all the smoke and lightening effects or if I go to a heavily vegetated area it’ll drop to mid 40s. But it’s stay consistently at 55-65 and even goes Into the 90s if I head out of the city.   Haven’t tried it at quality or with dlss off though. May go do that now that it says only 19fps lol. Have to try it to see for myself,Neutral
Intel,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-dlss-35-tested-ai-powered-graphics-leaves-competitors-behind  Well it's so close (54fps) it's more like a 3080Ti or higher from 3000 series or a 4070TI + from 4000 series it seems? The old 3000 series is punching way above it weight vs the 7900xtx, which was meant to deliver similar RT performance to the 3090.. which it doesn't.",Neutral
Intel,At some point the RT pixels are so expensive that native resolution w/o DLSS and frame gen is just not gonna work for the time being.,Negative
Intel,"On the other hand, if you set the new DLSS 3.5 to performance (which you should in 4k), and just enable frame generation, you get 90+ in 4k with basically zero issues unless you pause to check frames.",Neutral
Intel,So rendering at 960p? Oof...,Neutral
Intel,"you take that back, I literally returned my 4080FE for a 4090 liquid x for more frames in cyberpunk.",Neutral
Intel,I almost see no difference.   And to see the little diffidence I need to take two screenshots and compare them.,Neutral
Intel,The game look is ruined on PT it makes everything look completely different.  Regular RT keeps the style of the game and performs good.,Positive
Intel,Dont use useless raytracing and you wont have any problems lol,Negative

Intel,Only people who don't give a shit about high quality graphics don't care about ray tracing.,Negative
Intel,I got a stupidly good deal on the 4090(buddy won an extra one from a company raffle) and it just so happened my XTX was one of the cards suffering from the mounting issue on release.  Honestly very happy that all of that happened. Sure I would have been happy with the 7900xtx if I got a replacement but the 4090 just kinda blew me away especially with all the DLSS tech behind it.,Positive
Intel,"Nvidia used cp77 as a testing grounds for their dlss3 and rt tech, it'd no surprise it looks and performs relatively good, they literally partnered with cdpr for that.  Do not expect these levels of RT on most games anytime soon, probably in a couple years (with rtx 5000 series) the tech will be more mature and not as taxing for most cards, because needing to upscale and use framegen to get 60fps on an RT PT setting is kinda absurd.",Neutral

Intel,>Ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick   This line was already false years ago when control launched. Now it’s just absurd,Negative
Intel,"There are a lot of new games that features Ray Tracing on them as of now, too bad most of them doesn't look as visually as good as they could be though as most of the time their RT effects are dumbed down or reduced to the point it's pointless.  But the thing is that wasn't the point even from the beginning, RT Overdrive on Cyberpunk is literally considered as a Technological showcase  What matters here IMO for all of us is PC platform in general is showcasing here what a real high-end computers can achieve beyond what current gen console can do, and they are showcasing it really well here on Cyberpunk with much better visuals and using plenty of tricks to make them more than playable, where they shouldn't be considering how much demanding they are over standard, that is impressive enough to me and shows a good sign of technological engineering innovation.   As what Bryan Catanzaro said on his interview on DF Direct, work smarter not harder, brute force is not everything, of course it still matters a lot but doing it alone is starting to become pointless just like how it is on real life.",Negative
Intel,Much more fps :) Newer generation cards have at least 50-60% better raster performance then prev gen.,Positive
Intel,The Evangelical Church of Native,Neutral
Intel,"So just to be clear, you don't like running games at native resolution? Because the purpose of DLSS is to improve performance by specifically not running at native resolution",Neutral
Intel,Nice but ive been playing video games since the 70s and its Shit end off..,Negative
Intel,The future of frame generation is going to be huge. I can definitely see 360p frame rendering upscaled to 4k with 80% maybe even 90% of the frames being generated. All with equal to or even better visual quality.   A 20 FPS game like this will become a 100-200fps game.  We may be looking at the end of beefy graphics cards being required to play games. Just a good enough mid or low tier chip (granted 5-10 years from now) with frame generation might be enough.,Positive
Intel,"After 2.0, it's around 100""fps"". Just 60""fps"" (meaning with FG enabled) is far from being playable due to latency. You need at least 90""fps"" for playable experience.   Cyberpunk PT vs RT is a huge difference in terms of graphics, while DLSS Quality vs Balanced is really slim in comparison. What you say would be a really bad trade-off.   At 1440p DLSS Quality it's easily 120+""fps"" which is perfectly comfortable.",Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is greatly optimized. It looks fantastic for the hardware it asks. Starfield looks like game from 5 years that asks hardware from the future.,Positive
Intel,"Yeah, sure, now go back to play starfield.",Neutral
Intel,"There literally is a /s, what else do you need to detect sarcasm?",Neutral
Intel,"Someone made a really cool comment yesterdays on Reddit that even a generated frame using path tracing is less fake than a rasterized frame. It is effectively closer to reference truth.

Intel,haha this is gold 🥇,Neutral
Intel,"At the moment, it’s definitely what it seems like.  Especially seeing how there’s only one card on the planet that can run this. Do you have a 4090?",Neutral

Not at all, in fact another AAA game with ""path tracing"" is coming out next month.  >The tech will only become viable once the flagship GPU'S start getting 4k 60fps at native  Forget ""native"", that ship has already sailed. Nvidia, AMD and Intel are all working on machine learning techniques, and several game developers are starting to optimize their games around DLSS/FSR.",Neutral
Intel,"Nope, not even close.  Shaders 3.0 - that's improvement. Ray tracing is noticeable, but nowhere near to justify the hit.  I've looked techpowerup comparison RT vs LOW (lol). Low looked far better and cleaner, then blurry mess of RT (Overdrive).   I don't need ""realistic"" lighting, I need pleasent bisual part with good gameplay.

Intel,"In a screenshot, sure. When actually playing the game, unless the fps is low enough to remind them, 99,99% of people will forget if they left it on or not.",Negative
Intel,Pixar movies will sometimes take the better part of a day to render a single 4k frame on a render farm. So the fact that Cyberpunk takes more than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame in its path-tracing mode on a single 4090 clearly means that it's unoptimized garbage! /s  EDIT: Apparently people in this thread don't understand sarcasm (or don't understand how a path-traced game can take longer than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame with high-poly path tracing and still be optimized).,Negative
Intel,Man you had to lap your q9300 to hit 3.0ghz? Those chips really weren't OC friendly.  My q6600 hummed along 3.2 no problem on 92mm arctic freezer and a slight voltage bump.  I was so pumped when I upgraded to a gtx 260. Crysis was a dream.,Positive
Intel,Funnily Crysis still have better destructible environments than Cyberpunk has tho,Positive
Intel,"This. People losing their shit either weren't around when Crysis launched or have forgotten just how demanding it was . PT CP kicks the shit out of a 4090, Crysis murdered my 8800ultra.",Negative
Intel,crysis did not do 1080p 60 on maximum setting and dx10 on a 8800GT.   I had a 1280*1024 monitor back then and barely had 30 fps with my 8800GT.   Even the 8800 Ultra did not do 60 fps on full hd.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=46j6fDkMq9I,Negative
Intel,"Man, I remember how hype the 8800gt was. Thing was a hell of a big jump compared to previous cards that came out, prolly our first REALLY powerful card.

Intel,This is still the case to this day because the game includes a really old DLL file for PhysX. The other day I followed the instructions on the PCGamingWiki to delete some DLL files in the game directory and only then it ran perfectly smooth on my RTX 3070.,Neutral
Intel,LOL I remember this exact scene also.,Positive
Intel,"CPU PhysX back then was single-threaded and relied on ancient x87 instructions if I recall correctly, basically gimped on purpose. Even with a 5800X3D the shattering glass reduces the frame rate to the low teens.

Intel,Ah good old Ageia before nvidia bought them out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageia,Neutral
Intel,"No, you could actually install two Nvidia cards and dedicate one of them to only PhysX.",Neutral
Intel,"It would certainly be possible, but it wouldn't really make sense. Splitting it up on multiple GPUs would have a lot of the same problems that sli/crossfire had. You would have to duplicate memory, effort, and increase latency when you composite the final image.  It may or may not make sense to maybe have a raster chiplet and a ray tracing chiplet on the same processor package on a single gpu. But, probably makes more sense to have it all on one chiplet, and just use many of the same chiplet for product segmentation purposes instead.   A separate PPU did make sense tho, I'm still annoyed that the nvidia ageia deal essentially kill the PPU in the cradle. Our gaming rigs would cost more if PPUs became a thing, but we could have had a lot better physics then we do today. There is still a revolution in physics to be had some day...",Negative
Intel,would be cool if 2000/3000 series users could get a small tensor core only PCIe card to upgrade to framegen,Positive
Intel,"That's true, but if he's talking about *the equivalent* of a current $200-class card, I'd say about it's 10 years, what do you think?",Neutral
Intel,At least with the 4090 you can run 70% power target and still hit insane FPS while only pulling around 300w which is the same as my old 3080. The gains with that extra 150w are a couple percent at best. Not worth it to me.,Negative

Intel,"They are still the same thing and should be named the same, your disclaimer is just semantics about the implementation.",Neutral
Intel,"Weird argument.  Traditional raster is cheats upon cheats upon cheats already.  In fact, all of the lighting entirely in raster is essentially cheats.",Negative
Intel,It will not work well/look good using a single frame worth of data either due to the low ray counts. Digital Foundry has shown Metro Exodus builds the lighting over ~20 frames or so and it seems like Cyberpunk is even more. Even Cyberpunk ray pathtracing doesn't look as good in motion due to that same build-up effect.  You need to cast 20-50x the rays to have enough data for a single frame but then you will be measuring the game performance by seconds per frame.,Negative
Intel,"RT looks significantly better than raster when it’s not just using simple reflections like a Far Cry 6. Raster is all cheats, the so called reflections are essentially rendering the scene or part of the scene being reflected in reverse then applying fake material effects to mimic metal, water, etc. Raster also takes HUNDREDS to thousands of person hours to get the fake reflections and lighting to look decent to good. That’s why devs love RT and want it to grow, as RT/hardware does the work for them.",Negative
Intel,It's significantly better than raster. It kills fps but the quality is great,Positive
Intel,Better graphics needing more expensive hardware is hardly a hot take.,Negative

Intel,"That's how I feel as well. It looks awesome don't get me wrong, but it doesn't look like cyberpunk to me.",Negative
Intel,It's not a perfect way of measure but you can clearly see how (at least on Nvidia GPUs) the 8/10GB cards are way behind the >11Gb cards. Meaning you need 11 or 12GB of VRAM for this scenario which cripples the 3080 but not the 3060.  We said from the start these configurations are shit but no-one listened. There you go.,Negative
Intel,The crypto miners did me a comical solid by preventing me from acquiring many countless times and hours I wasted (came from a gtx1070 before finally being able to upgrade). Was able to get my 6900xt eventually for around $600 with 2 games. Becoming increasing thankful for the extra Vram these days.   Once I start getting through my game backlog and into the gard hitting ray tracing ones will hopefully upgrade to something with at least 24gigs of GDDR# lol.,Positive
Intel,"I mean, Alan Wake 2 is also releasing with path tracing so my guess is we're definitely gonna see more games featuring heavier RT, although not necessarily path tracing due to the performance hit.",Negative
Intel,"I expect path tracing support to be the exception for a while because most developers will consider the non-trivial dev time to implement it not worth it. However, I'm sure Nvidia would be willing to throw dev help at most developers who would be willing to implement path tracing with their help.  Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090). That's substantially faster than than how fast a 4090 runs Cyberpunk on the path tracing mode. Presumably, a less complex world helps, but they may also have implemented opacity micro maps, which I'm not sure if Cyberpunk has done in the 2.0 update. Perhaps they're cherry-picked examples for the trailer.",Neutral
Intel,Raytracing now is a gimmick *  ( * - in AMD sponsored games where RT effects are so tiny you have to zoom on to notice them),Neutral
Intel,"Except this is a tech demo. CP77 has lots of cut corners to achieve that, NN was trained to keep the interface stable in that game and even then, ray reconstruction creates horrible artifacts at some angles and distances. And that's with Ngreedia's engineeers literally sitting at CDPR's office.",Negative
Intel,You can already have 120fps on $1000 PC,Neutral
Intel,It improves both looks and fps so it is a win win,Positive
Intel,"The issue with this is the inputs will only be registered at 20Hz. This would feel awful. The benefit of high FPS is having very low latency. This will just make it look smoother, not feel any better than 20 FPS",Negative
Intel,Considering there is no input on the generated frames that is going to feel horrible to play. Base FPS (incl DLSS) really still needs to be 50-60fps to feel playable imo.,Negative
Intel,I'm thinking will there ever come a day where 100% of frames are generated by AI. Like the data inputs directly from the card into the neural network and it no longer requires physical hardware limitation to generate frames.,Neutral
Intel,"Don't forget that all NPCs will be controled by AI to simulate a real life.  They'll wake up in the morning, shower, commute to work, work, then go home.

Intel,It absolutely is. I’ve been playing at 1440p with DLSS Balanced and Ray Reconstruction and it is absolutely the worst version of DLSS I’ve ever seen. It’s basically unusable.,Negative
Intel,There are horrible artifacts with RR. And ghosting. It replaces artifacts with different ones. Needs a lot more work tbh. Or training.,Neutral
Intel,"The thing about ray and path tracing is that they are demanding on their own, not because they are badly optimised",Neutral
Intel,"I have a 4070. It runs the game just fine with the tools that have been set in place.  This is absolutely not a pissing match. Cyberpunk is demanding, and takes advantage of lots of tech available for upscaling and ray tracing and frame generation. AMD card’s currently do not match Nvidia’s in those categories, not even close. This us not an attempt to showcase Nvidia tech, but it does take advantage of it.",Positive
Intel,Because it's not about the flagship card. Only if the flagship can attain good performance at native then you will have headroom for lower end cards. Think about it. Of course upscaling is very important. But you also need some headroom to upscale.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah. I wanted better cooling performance after upgrading to the artic freezer 7 as well with those weird crapy plastic tension clips you pushed in manually, fearing bending them (worse than the stock intel cooler tension twist lock). Kept having random stability crashes until after i sanded it down for better thermals...Good old sandpaper and nerves of steel fearing an uneven removal of the nickel coating.  Was trying to maximize performance as back then core 2 duo and the extreme versions were king and they had way higher single core clocks and were easy to oc. Wanted the multhreaded for Crysis, LoL (back when you had to wait 5min+ to get into a game), BF2, and was eventually playing TF, Day of Defeat and Natural Selection.  My upgrade back then was to the Evga 560ti DS, which I ended up installing a backplate and  a gelid cooler. They had wayy better thermal tape/individual heatsinks for the memory/vram chips for the heat transfer. Evga back then told me if I ever needed to RMA it that I would just need to re-assemble it as it was shipped.

Remember in 2011 upgrading to a gtx 570, the first gen with tessellation and playing dragon age 2 which was one of the first games to have it. Ended up turning off tessellation cause it hit the card too hard, least until I got a second 570 in sli, which sadly died like a year later due to heat while playing Shadow Warrior.",Positive

Intel,"There was more nuance to that ""bugfix"" than just ""it was a bug that got fixed""   Modders were able to re-enable the AMD/NVIDIA PhysX combo basically immediately via editing DLLs.  Not driver replacements, but actual DLL tweaks.  The speed at which modders were able to fix what NVIDIA ""broke"" combined with the public outrage put them in a funny legal spot.  If they continued with PhysX disabled and claiming it was a bug then the bug can easily be fixed, as shown by modders doing it first.  So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.  Obviously not many modern games use the GPU implementation of PhysX anymore and the performance difference between current GPU and CPU implementations are negligible anyway, but their intent at the time was clear once it was shown how quickly modders were able to get everyone back to normal.",Neutral

Intel,I like how you said: static image  because in motion upscaling is crappier,Neutral
Intel,"It isn't a weird argument. Rasterization is premised on approximating reality, while RT is simulating it.  The extreme few amount of rays we trace right now, including bounces, means effects are often muted and the performance hit is enormous. To compensate, we're using temporal upscaling from super low resolutions *and* frame interpolation.  Temporal upscaling isn't without it's issues, and you know how much traditional denoisers leave to be desired. Even Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction leaves a lot to be desired; the thread on r/Nvidia shows as much, with ghosting, artifacts, etc. all over again. It's like the launch of DLSS 2.0.  All of that, for effects that are oftentimes difficult to perceive, and for utterly devastating traditional rasterization performance.",Negative
Intel,"It's a shame raster is so labor intensive, because it looks so interesting when done right.     I look at screenshots from cyberpunk, Raster / Ray Trace / Path Trace, and in most of them the raster just looks more interesting to me. Not constrained by what would be real physical lighting. The 100% RT render versions of old games like Quake gives a similar feeling.

Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090).

In HDR that ""bloom"" looks awesome as it's super bright like it would be in real life but still not losing any details. You lose those details only on those SDR videos.  PT just looks and feels way more natural than just RT, when only raster literally looks like it was two different games from two different hardware generations.  Once I saw Cyperpunk PT there is no way I'd imagine playing this game in any other way. All other games look absurdly ugly next to it now. It's something like when you get a high refresh screen and can't look back at 60Hz anymore.",Negative

Almost 70% still have 1080p.   CDPR made a VERY demanding game that looks GORGEOUS completely turned up. Modern hardware cannot handle it natively, it can’t. It is not a gimmick that a company has developed a superior technology that allows the game to be played at almost the same quality as native, significantly smoother and faster. You’re in denial if you think otherwise.  I’m not tied to either brand. I have an AMD CPU bc it was the best option for what I wanted, and a Nvidia GPU for the same reason. I care about RT, frame gen, all of that. The Witcher 3 still is my favorite game, and the entire reasoning for building a gaming PC over a console is graphical quality and speed while doing so. That game is absolutely gorgeous with RT on. Same with Cyberpunk, which I can enjoy thanks to DLSS.   You don’t care about those things? That’s fine, but it is solely a personal opinion.",Negative
Intel,"Yea well I was defining an arbitrary performance. It's not about having native performance. But, but if a flagship is able to get 4k 60 with path tracing at native then that allows headroom for 60 tier or 70 tier cards to perform well.  In this example the 4090 gets 19.5 fps at 4k. The 4060ti gets 6.6 fps. Let's assume a next gen flagship is able to reach 60 fps at 4k. That would theoratically allow the 60ti card to reach around 20 fps.

Raster techniques have evolved a lot since then, and use raytracing in limited contexts, screen space reflections and ambient occlusion for example, but they're still operating with extremely limited data in narrow, isolated use cases, which is why they often look awful.

Intel,"Thanks for sharing your findings. It's pretty damning if even the Windows Task Manager does a markedly better job than Adrenalin.

Intel,"NVIDIA's highest tier? Nah, but around RTX 4080 is the target, which might be bad news for AMD.",Negative
Intel,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",Neutral

Intel,"To defend AMD here as loathe as I am lately. CPU utilization isn't a very useful metric to begin with, so it misreporting would be super low priority.  The stat tells you nothing useful about the hardware, just the thread scheduling. CPU could be stuck in wait and reporting a high number while doing no work or it could be bottlenecking somewhere else while reporting a low %.",Negative
Intel,Where are you seeing this?,Neutral
Intel,"The Adrenalin overlay is good for really everything except usage. But yeah, this has seemed to have been a problem for a good while now. Ive been using AMD for a little over a year now at least Adrenalin and the CPU usage was always wrong on two different CPUs (AM4 and AM5) as well. Me and that other person tested it on my system and he had 3 systems running different AMD CPUs and all were the same. Ill find the thread one day but its been a while so it is way down the list of my comments.",Negative
Intel,"False setup.  Disable the button in the ui ( not settings)  For ""load on startup""  You literarily told afterburner to load it's settings on start up.  Huge mistake many people do because most people think it's ""boot on startup"" but in reality it's loading it's oc settings and stuff effectively overwriting adrenaline if you leave that enabled.",Negative
Intel,3070 Also was their target for their first generation. I don't expect Intel to suddenly be great just because that's what they aim for.,Neutral

Intel,Great news to gamers though,Positive
Intel,ah sorry I meant NVK,Neutral
Intel,"I don't know, I didn't downvote you.",Neutral
Intel,My point is if you've got nvidia card you simply use 3rd party soft and got everything and more. So comparing that AMD's software to Nvidia's is kind of meaningless.,Neutral
Intel,"I actually agree with you, but I don't need the metric to be some scientifically accurate reading of performance or whatnot, I just think it'd be a useful tool for adjusting game settings. For example, if I'm trying to optimize performance in a game, does this setting make CPU utilization go up or down? How much almost doesn't matter. Is there a bottleneck, where is it, and am I relieving pressure on it with these settings or not?",Neutral
Intel,It’s where you oc in adrenaline,Neutral
Intel,"There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Not because upscaling, but also because how important is to have drivers that work in tandem with specialized hardware units in the GPU.  Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  AMD fails hard on 2 of those things.  Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.",Neutral
Intel,"Yep, XeSS is just great, I happily use it in MWII on my Arc A770. But I still use DLSS on NVIDIA. But both are better than FSR.",Positive
Intel,"Then you should be looking at ***GPU*** usage, because CPU usage will not help you answer any of those questions",Negative
Intel,"Problem is, by itself it still tells you little to nothing. If GPU utilization drops like a brick you know something is bottlenecking. If CPU utilization changes in the absence of other data you know absolutely nothing of value.   The real kicker is the CPU utilization may not even be ""wrong"", it may just be polling at a very low rate because that's the other thing with these OSDs if you poll too frequently for up-to-date data that can kill performance from the overhead.",Negative
Intel,"> There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  Yep, tools like [this one from NVIDIA](https://youtu.be/-IK3gVeFP4s?t=51) have made it easier than ever as a dev to optimise for NVIDIA hardware.  > AMD fails hard on 2 of those things. Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.  Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts. Arc is just getting started, give Intel 5-10 years of time in GPU and they will outpace AMD for sure.",Positive
Intel,"There are many settings that directly impact CPU usage, so of course CPU utilization reading can be useful.  Not everything needs to be precisely accurate, this is a lousy defense. Getting 0% reads all the time is entirely worthless but some accurate reads is still useful information.",Neutral
Intel,"You are going out of your way to defend a broken feature.    7800X3D shows up as 1% CPU utilization during games such as Watch Dogs, Stellaris, Age of Empires. Clearly broken. Undefendable.",Negative
Intel,"And with a bit of luck, they will also hit AMD in the console market.  Right now AMD stays afloat GPU speaking because consoles, they were during a lot of years the only vendor offering both CPU and GPU in a single package, reducing costs A LOT.  Nvidia was not able to compete against that with the lack of CPUs and Intel with the lack of GPUs.  Now that Intel is working on dedicated GPUs they are going to eventually create APU like products, its just the natural outcome of producing both CPUs and GPUs.  And then AMD will NEED to compete against them instead of being the only option.  And if that happens, unless FSR gets turned into a hardware specific tech like XeSS that falls into different techs depending on the GPU its running on, AMD will be murdered.  Better software stack, better general hardware to accelerate and improve upscalling keeping costs down AND being a second player pushing prices down towards Sony and Microsoft?  AMD will be screwed up if they don't up their game. And hard.",Neutral
Intel,"Right, so what kind of useful information can you tell me if I raise graphics settings and CPU utilization goes from 12-16% to 16-17% while framerate goes down from 120 fps to 110 fps?",Neutral
Intel,"All CPU utilization tells anyone is thread scheduling, and nothing about what the threads are or aren't doing. Like the only situation that it marginally tells someone anything is how many threads a program uses. But that usually doesn't fluctuate with games, games usually scale up to <x> number of threads and that is that. GPU utilization is the one that is far more useful for spotting bottlenecks, general performance observations are far more useful for tweaking.  Even Intel and co. will tell you that with modern processors and all the elements they contain as well as hyperthreading/SMT CPU utilization isn't a very useful stat anymore. Meant a whole lot more when CPUs were one core unit and didn't also include the FPU and memory controller and everything else.",Neutral
Intel,"Cause unfortunately even if it wasn't broken, it's not useful in any meaningful capacity. Should it be broken? No. Would anything notable come of it if it were fixed? Also no. Given the bugs they got and room for improvement elsewhere it's one of those things that should be super low on the priority list or just removed wholesale.",Negative
Intel,"That whatever setting you are changing does not have much of an impact on CPU utilization, and if your GPU allows, you can use it.  What is the purpose of this question, are you really not aware of any settings that impact CPU usage? Some RT settings have big impacts on CPU usage too.",Neutral
Intel,"The problem you're missing here is that settings that are CPU demanding generally don't have an easily observable impact on CPU usage, if they have any impact at all.  The reliable way to see if a setting is CPU demanding is to turn it up, see the frame rate go down, and then look at how **GPU** usage changed.",Neutral
Intel,"I'm aware that some settingd impact CPU usage, but I think looking at the CPU usage is about as useful as your daily horoscope, or AIDA64 memory benchmark",Neutral

Intel,3050ti?  Gaming rip?  No,Neutral
Intel,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",Neutral

Intel,"e cores are surprisingly powerful now, and games are getting more multithreaded. It might be better to spread them out over 8 less power hungry cores than 4 P cores and then spill over to the slower cores. Especially in a laptop environment where efficiency matters and the GPU is usually holding back gaming performance so much that CPU performance is really not that important.  In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread. But most importantly, it doesn't do so evenly. Maybe you don't need something assigned to e cores, or the e core task is light and doesn't hold up the other threads. Then things will run at the pace of the P cores, but every now and then you'll have a slowdown.",Neutral

Gaming benchmarks tend to have a really strong feedback loop that favors last gen hardware design though.

Yeah 9950X should outperform it technically I guess but the split L3 between two CCDs probably holds back the advantage of having more cores.  Yeah sadly there's no benchmark for Bannerlord. But supposedly it does disperse its tasks to plenty of threads.   Here's some benchmarks showing core and thread usage in a few games.

Intel,">12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark  It's because Creation Engine 2 worked better with Intel hardware until AM5 X3D chips, and 12900K great result in this test just shows that it's still a good CPU with 8 Performance cores, not that it's core count matters in any significant way - for example, 7700X delivers identical performance with lower core count/threads.  >lower clock speed than even 7700X  Clock speeds can't be compared between different architectures, different architecture = different efficiency, what matters is IPC.  >shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much  [here's a better example where more intel CPUs are present in Starfield test](https://youtu.be/XXLY8kEdR1c?t=29m5s), as you can see, increased core count/threads past 8 performance cores and 16 thread's is meaningless and won't provide any noticeable performance improvements, 6 faster P-cores on Intel 14600K provided better result than slower 8 P-cores on 12900K.   Going from 7950X to to 7700X results in 5 FPS loss, which is like 2-3% less FPS, and it's mostly because of lower clock speed(5.7Ghz Vs 5.4Ghz boost).   >but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.  That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.  Edit: typo",Positive

Same with Starfield.   That's because in video games, core count matters less than how fast the CPU can access or manipulate very dynamic types of data in a random memory address.    X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"". They're going to win in old or new games, and they're winning in games because they have a large buffer of low latency data. Not winning in productivity benchmarks because productivity is about processing matters more than accessing data, and its more easily multithreaded too in many cases.    But having more cores is still more advantageous in software and games that can occupy them.",Neutral
Intel,">Well you said that games are optimized for 8/16 and yet gn bench shows 7600X only gets 3-4 less avg fps than 7700X  I said ""can and will"" not that every game is going to benefit from it.  Point of discussion was to prove that games are using more than 16 threads or they're not - it seems like you overestimated Starfield, UE5 reliance on core count/threads and most games care about 16 threads at most.   >core count matters less  Yes, that's why I replied to that person and asked him to provide me with modern AAA games which are more ""multi-threaded"" now than AAA games a few years ago, I feel like what he ""observes"" is what he wants to believe, and not something that actually happened with optimization in games.  >X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"".  AMD sells 9950X3D, best productivity and gaming CPU, if you really need both(workloads/gaming) it's the optimal way, for an average user, only benefit of E-cores is lower power draw when idle - but they do matter more if you need those workloads, I agree, but we discussed gaming performance and core reliance.",Neutral

The world is becoming more graphical. The world is embracing AI and more rapid than any other technology ever. So I would expect Intel to respond to that, right? It's not like we have to guess what is what is big and what is coming. We know and what's coming is more AI and more graphical experiences.  With this being said, I hope that means that the Nvidia/Intel deal means that the ARC division is not going away any time soon.",Neutral
Intel,"Panther Lake with Xe3 without any doubt will be generational uplift. Intel Lunar Lake which is last year chip still able to put Amd newest chip like Z2E to the shame.   Xe3 with 12 Xe cores not to mention with XeSS XMX is going to be terrific combo, seeing how disappointing Amd Z2E i can see Intel going to steal iGPU gaming market from Amd. Next year could ended up with more OEM using Intel chip for handheld.",Positive
Intel,I found it interesting that he specifically mentions improvements in performance per area for Xe3. A big complaint of Xe2 is that the die size is noticeably larger than a similar performance GPU from AMD or Nvidia. Hopefully this means better financials for Intel’s graphics division with this new architecture.,Positive
Intel,Says nothing about discrete graphics. Think that's clearly dead at this point.,Negative
Intel,"Lmfao now I’m feeling conflicted about my very recent MSI Claw purchase, but I suppose panther lake handhelds will likely launch middle of next year anyway",Negative

Intel,"Despite the vast improvement more Xe3 cores than we saw Xe2 cores in Lunar Lake, we're only seeing minor gains in average framerate performance at the same wattage based on the internal benchmark, though there are much more meaty improvements in the 1% lows. I guess its bottlenecked by its RAM bandwidth. Also I'm sure Xe3 will scale better beyond 17W. I wonder how the 4 Xe3 SKUs will fare, that's a good way of knowing how much RAM bandwidth affects things.",Neutral
Intel,"Just because you have 50% more physical units, doesn't mean you'll automatically get 50% more performance. Remember when the Z1E came out and it was supposed to be 50-100% more power than the steam deck?",Neutral
Intel,RTX 3050 Max-Q or 1660 ti Max Q laptop card. Within that range.,Neutral
Intel,Yes,Positive
Intel,"For them to do a 'big iGPU' design they would need to do a few things:  1. Use a different socket.  The iGPU will get too big for the existing one.  2. Upgrade the memory bus to 256bit.  That uses some power and silicon.  3. Add cache to the chip for the iGPU to use (to make up for the poor bandwidth they get from LPDDR5, even with a wider bus)  If they don't do this then the chip (which again won't fit in their default socket) will be massively bandwidth constrained to the degree that it's pointless.  Basically, do all the stuff that Strix Halo did.  Issue is Strix Halo didn't sell very well, the idea is a proof of concept and the concept needs faster memory to really work well.  LPDDR6 might help a lot at getting these big chip ideas from a XX60 level to a XX70 level, but they still require a lot of expensive chip work and a new motherboard design custom to the big socket.  I suspect we'll get there eventually, but it'll be a few years before people start calling it quits on dGPUs.",Neutral
Intel,"50% is not minor...  Also they said >50%, or greater than 50%. It looks like 70-80% to me.  Since scaling isn't linear I expect 4 Xe3 to come close to Xe2 or even equal it.",Neutral
Intel,Maybe I'm confused about what they're advertising but weren't they just going head to head with 4060s with the b580? Wouldn't 3050 range be a huge step backwards?,Neutral
Intel,"Damn, still behind my old 1060 pc",Negative
Intel,And some of the tiles are internal not on TSMC.,Neutral
Intel,"On-package memory doesn't raise the device price from and end user perspective. It's a margin challenge for Intel because OEMs want the margins from the memory, so Intel needs to pass it along at cost.   Technically, on-package memory can even be cheaper because it can let you simplify the rest of the PCB. Iso-speed, that is.",Neutral
Intel,Are you saying you expect people to not want discrete gpu's in the future?  What about the direction of gaming would make you think that?,Negative
Intel,"> Since scaling isn't linear I expect 4 Xe3 to come close to Xe2 or even equal it.  The 4 Xe tile is on Intel 3, so it'll have a significant clock speed deficit vs the 12Xe tile.",Neutral
Intel,"No I'm talking about the internal game benchmarks they shared. Yeah the GPU architecture  itself is a lot better on paper, but they probably got bottlenecked by the low bandwidth of 128-bit LPDDR5. The uplift in 1% lows in some titles is impressive though.   [power-efficient-gaming-26.jpg (2133×1200)](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-panther-lake-technical-deep-dive/images/power-efficient-gaming-26.jpg)  And yeah I'd not be surprised if 4 Xe3 is going to be closer to the 8 Xe2 in LNL than people would expect.",Neutral
Intel,The b580 is a full power desktop card. The one they're advertising here is a tiny little integrated gpu on a laptop processor,Neutral
Intel,Well it's not out yet so these are just predictions. Better to be conservative with estimates than overpromise.,Negative
Intel,"We already knew they cancelled desktop variants though, Panther lake was going to be around Arrow Lake laptop performance no matter what.",Neutral
Intel,"If people can get a XX60ti level iGPU in a laptop, which means you don't have to worry about MUX switches (hardware or software), possibly have a cheaper platform (if scaled) since you don't need a separate GPU board, have access to a ton of RAM (many mid-range GPUs are RAM limited), and due to reduced complexity and the ability to better dynamically manage power can get a more effective slim chassis with less throttling... then yeah, it'd be pretty good.  The next big jump is LPDDR6 which looks to potentially hit a 50% bandwidth increase and marginally lower latency.  Combine that with a wide bus and you're looking at enough to power a XX70 series mobile chip.  The framework is immature but it could be competitive in the future.  We'll see!",Positive
Intel,"Buddy, that's 140V with optimizations. They are telling you what they have done to further optimize their graphics, including drivers and power management. and that they'll further apply this in the future. Did you really look at the slide?",Neutral

Intel,\>HUB  That's shovelware and I'm not clicking that shit.,Negative
Intel,"They've tested it with just three AMD cpus. Weird pairings. I would pair B580 with any i5 from last couple years. Seriously their testing is getting less and less ""real life"" and more for the purpose of a good clickbait.",Negative
Intel,"I couldn’t believe the video I was watching, the thumbnail was pure clickbait. They fixed one game, and improved some others a little.  And NEVER an Intel CPU in sight. I like the B580, but it deserves better ""testing"" than this.",Positive
Intel,The problem is still here. 9060 xt with 5600 is faster than B580 with 9800x3d and B580 still loses 8% with 5600 instead of 9800x3d. Which means that cpu bottleneck starts much sooner for ARC gpu.,Negative
Intel,"Is this related to historically Intel compiler not compiling code efficiently for AMD cpus? Does it also make Intel CPUs overhead better? If yes, then they really fixed something. If no, then they wrote code normally for AMD cpus as well as Intel cpus.",Neutral
Intel,"the B580 is a modern gpu, it should be paired with a modern cpu, preferably an Intel one, going with old school Ryzen cpus is a bad path to take.",Negative
Intel,"The problem is that this title makes it sound like they fixed the cpu overhead issue in every game, but that's not the case. Some games are still affected. Obviously any fix is better than nothing, but depending on what games you want to play, you will still see an overhead issues. It is nice though that in some of the games the overhead problem has been addressed though.",Negative
Intel,"Haven't watched the video, but damn.   If rue, HUB has officially become clickbait garbage. Not outright lying, but intentionally conveying misleading half-truths. Starting at least with the AMD fine wine video.",Negative
Intel,"It's meant to test low end, mid and high end.",Neutral
Intel,"The exact CPU model is hardly relevant. The point was to show CPUs of a certain power level. Not sure how this makes it less ""real life"" as if all three CPUs shown weren't extremely popular for their time. Also not sure what one would achieve when using Intel CPUs specifically.",Neutral
Intel,"These guys absolutely *refuse* to test with an Intel CPU, it's very weird.",Negative
Intel,"5700x would have made a lot of sense compared to 5600  12400f,13400f should be included as well",Neutral
Intel,Exactly. Its nice that some games were fixed but between that and calling the issue (entirely) fixed there is a big gap.,Negative
Intel,"Indeed and it is something very interesting, because the reason the driver overhead is an issue on 6 core cpu's is because modern games use all 6 cores, so if the driver has a big overhead the CPU has nu free cores available for the driver.  Especially Intel CPU's with more (e-)cores in their budget CPU's should probably suffer a lot less.   I would expect an i5-12400 to suffer the same as a Ryzen 5 5600,  But an i5-13400/14400 has an additional 4-e cores to deal with the overhead. The 13500/14600 even has 8 e cores.      I would very much like to see the comparison   i5-12400, i5-13400, i5-13500, Ryzen 5 5600(X)",Neutral
Intel,Would not have mattered. the cpu bottleneck in the intel driver is single-thread limited and largely due to draw-calls being stored in system memory as a buffer for the frametime render. (at least as far as my debugging could lead me)  (that's also why its less impacted on ddr5 systems no matter what CPU),Neutral
Intel,"They pushed the 6 core parts too hard as ""good budget parts"" for too long to not keep using them as their reference...  Even when we're seeing games that now have strokes when they don't have 8 cores to play with.",Negative
Intel,"possibly. Honestly weird as hell to not through in intel cpu results with the same gpus so they can see if it's a all cpu overhead issue, or an issue with amd cpus with intel gpu. Like even one game if intel/amd gave about the same performance you could likely rule it out somewhat.  Also weird to say they fixed it if by the sounds of it to say it's fixed if a very limited number of games were updated to work better in also seemingly limited scenarios. That's more like finding a specific problem on a specific game they were able to improve rather than an underlying fix which if implemented should help everywhere.",Negative
Intel,"No, B580 also performed poorly on i5-8400 and 10400 (both are 5600X-esq)",Negative
Intel,"The driver compiler is for GPU, not CPUs.",Neutral
Intel,9800X3D is the fastest CPU for gaming on the market. The usage of Intel or AMD CPUs doesn't inherently matter.,Neutral
Intel,It's been official for awhile. Funny how it takes a positive Intel title for people to realize.,Neutral

Intel,Welcome to the age of influencers...,Neutral
Intel,"Nvidia 5000 series has overheads issues even with 5800x3d... like 20% performance hit, you can fix it by capping fps or using Intel cpus. AMD CPUs always act weird when reaching 100% utilization.",Negative
Intel,That's not how CPUs work in games.,Neutral
Intel,Then they optimized drivers.,Neutral
Intel,Do you have peer-review data that confirms it?,Neutral
Intel,The video shows the B580 not having driver overhead issues with the 5600X but we don't know if it did previously on anything other than Spider-Man. His tone suggests the 5600X performance used to be worse but he provides no data other than Spider-Man to suggest it was for other games.,Negative
Intel,The fact that a switch from a 5600 to a 5700 with hardly a frequency gain eliminates the overhead issue suggest that is kind of  how games/drivers work.,Neutral
Intel,Which also fixed performance on 5600X,Neutral
Intel,"But that's now how games utilize CPU's.  What you get from games is usually 1 main thread that takes up one big core, then many less intense threads, that may or *may not* utilize the other cores, and to varying degrees. AKA you can have mainthread use 100% of core 0, but cores 1,2,3,4,5 are all 50% used, leaving 50% for other tasks to run freely.",Neutral
Intel,"Eventually you get the drivers where they need to be. People love to whine about Arc drivers but on the iGPU side people never complained. The community is never, ever happy with anything. Focusing their eggs on the Higher performance parts and then a slower LTS cadence keeping the old stuff alive is the right move.",Negative
Intel,"They will update, just not day 1 for certain games. Who's playing with integrated graphics?",Neutral

Intel,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Neutral

AMD,"Ya know the more i think about this the more pissed off I guess.  PC gaming has become increasingly unaffordable in recent years. I'm one of those old school ""60"" buyers. ya know, $200-300 for a GPU, and I plan to use it for around 4-6 years.   Since around 2018, we've been getting squeezed. First it was ray tracing and all that AI upscaling crap. Nvidia decided to make the 2060 $350 and threw anyone under that under the bus. Yeah, the 16 series existed, but let's face it, those cards aged like milk too.   Then COVID happened, the price inflation happened, and I was stuck on a 1060 through the pandemic. It lasted me well, but I knew it was aging, and quite frankly, GPU manufacturers stopped giving a crap about us. THey gave us the 3060 for $330, which was a joke. And this was before the ""inflation"" all the yuppie tech bros on these subs use to justify ridiculous prices.   I managed to hold it together through COVID, and upgraded during the price crash in 2022-2023. AMD was hit first, the RX 6600 type cards could double my 1060's performance for under $300, while Nvidia was STILL charging $340 for the 3060. It was a joke. Nvidia didn't get it, I dodn't wanna pay over $300 for a fricking GPU so I bought a 6650 XT for $230. It was an amazing deal at the time.  When the 7000 series launched around then, and the rest of the series was rolled out into 2023, honestly, it offered a very poor value for the most part. RDNA2 cards were literally sold next to RDNA3 ones for most of RDNA3's lifespan. And quite frankly, there was often little reason to buyt RDNA3, it was more expensive, and offered little in price/performance over RDNA2.  RDNA2 was eventually phased out in the higher price classes, but for a while, the RX 6800 was sold along side the 7700 XT, the 6650 XT was sold next to the 7600, the 6700 XT/6750 XT were in their own niche that AMD never really replaced, and the 6600 remained supreme as the ultimate budget option, competing with the fricking RTX 3050 and thrashing it in value.  heck, I was recommending RX 6600s as recently as this year, and really only stopped when we FINALLY saw the market move with stuff like the RTX 5050 for $250, the RX 9060 XT 8 GB for $270, and the RTX 5060 for $300. Even then, what killed the RX 6600 more than anything was the fact that AMD just FINALLY phased it out of production a few months ago and it was no longer a cost effective recommendation.   And now, AMD pulls the rug from under RDNA2 users? This fast? Really?  I dont care if they axe RDNA1, the writing has been on the wall for RDNA1 for a while, no mesh shaders, RT, DX12 ultimate support, yeah, RDNA1 is done. But RDNA2 is still a viable architecture. Maybe it doesnt support the fancy AI bull#### for FSR4 or whatever. Do you know how much I care? Not at all. Im in a budget class where I dont care if I get the fanciest graphics. I just wanna RUN THE GAMES. And to do that, i need DRIVERS. There's no reason they can just make the games run FSR2/3 and allow older users to use that. Sure, maybe it will be blurrier, I admit FSR is an inferior upscaler, but it works, and again, I'd rather run a game with a little blur going on than not at all.   To not support the series with drivers, when this could render the GPU incompatible with new games is a DISGRACE. I bought my 6650 XT planning to use it until 2027, hoping that my next sub $300 GPU would offer twice the performance and more than 8 GB VRAM. I dont wanna upgrade now, spending $250-300 for 10-50% performance improvements (seriously, the 5050 is barely faster than the 6650 XT in raster) and 8 GB VRAM. I just dont. As such, I guess I'm gonna be stuck using an obsolete and no longer supported card for the mean time. Thanks a lot AMD. And oh, guess what, given that Nvidia is no longer charging like 50% more than AMD for the same class of product, I'm probably not gonna go AMD next time. Not if this is how I'm treated as a consumer.  Ive always been like at least somewhat biased toward Nvidia/intel because it seems like every time I buy AMD I get burned for some reason. SOmetimes its lack of VRAM, poor driver support, support for some BS API, or just poor performance like on older AMD CPUs I've owned. But yeah, they're just kinda giving me flashbacks to the late 2000s/early 2010s again when they didnt support their products while nvidia did. And I'm kinda feeling burned right about now.

AMD,"Let us retrace our steps to the spirited online debates of 2019, when early RDNA faced off against early RTX.  Early RDNA was pronounced the rational choice for the discerning enthusiast: modestly cheaper, often quicker in traditional rendering, and crucially unencumbered by ""gimmicks"" such as dedicated RT silicon or tensor cores. Ray-tracing was dismissed as an overpriced marketing indulgence, and DLSS was confidently predicted to vanish within the year. The RX 5700XT in particular was held up as an example: less costly than the RTX 2070 Super, marginally faster in raster. And best of all it was destined for superior longevity because the ""silly"" RT/AI gimmicks would surely perish like HairWorks. FPS-per-dollar at the moment of purchase would remain eternal as the only relevant metric of which GPU to buy.  Eternity, it seems, endured roughly until Adrenalin 25.10.2. AMD has now consigned both RDNA1 and RDNA2 to maintenance-only purgatory, with the driver graveyard following soon. Which is baffling considering how many systems and different products use early RDNA hardware. Even the RX 6750GRE finds itself affected, a card launched in late 2023. Imagine the uproar had NVIDIA deprecated the RTX2000+3000 series so quickly.  The RX 5700XT, once lauded for its value, is now remembered mainly for its hardware/software headaches. And when compared to the competition it now also lags in image quality (confined to FSR2/TAA) and framerate (due to increasing presence of RT in games). On the used market it usually trades for almost half the price of an RTX 2070 Super, a card it was supposedly better than in 2019.  Meanwhile the entire RTX 2000 series continues to receive full driver support, the GTX1000 cards that launched in 2016 are only starting to lose full support now. Games grow ever more dependent on RT. DLSS has become the gold standard rendering method and arguably the main reason NVIDIA secured overwhelming market share dominance in the 2020s. And even a 2018 RTX card benefits from the latest revisions and updates for all the newest ""gimmicks.""  AMD's 2025 RDNA4 series with its focus on ""ML accelerators"" and beefy RT units? They're actually pretty good cards (the 9070XT is AMD's best card in years) but they're also a belated concession by AMD that NVIDIA’s RTX blueprint was, in fact, the correct one. And the passage of time now positions early RDNA as a temporary measure, a stopgap until AMD figures out how to get back in the fight.  It remains quietly amusing how utterly wrong the YouTubers and online forums have misread the future about five-six years ago. Architecture/features/support, as it turns out, matter more than raster parity at a 5-10% discount.",Neutral

They quite clearly say 'Bug fixes' and 'maintenance mode' in that response from AMD Germany.      You think nVidia does driver optimization for 2000 and 3000 series cards? fuck no.. Those cards are also in 'maintenance mode'   making sure the game works with the card and bug fix and security patch if needed.      I can see why people are upset, but I also see it as AMD being transparent. Their older cards are in 'maintenance mode' now, which means they are still supported, will still get bug fixes, will still work with your games, but if you want the best experience, buy a newer card.      Nvidia does exactly the same, they just haven't given it a name.      Fight me 😂",Negative
AMD,"Outrage is fun, but no.  AMD state they will maintain it for bugs which is all it needs. These card are well understood by developers and game optimization is the ***developer's job*** not AMD's.  AMD might be involved in performance optimizations with new cards is when developers aren't familiar with them and new shaders (often based on old shaders) are found to not work well with very different architectures but that's not happening with cards designed in 2017.  There is no dropping of driver support. These are mature cards, known ISAs, they are already optimized for in current game engines.  If a developer is optimizing for RDNA2 and finds a bug AMD will still fix it. If AMD wants a new feature to run on these cards they will optimize for it. If there is a new DX12 or Vulkan extension AMD will add it. If a downstream customer has a problem (think Steamdeck, consoles etc) AMD will address it.

AMD and Intel GPUs run on open source drivers on Linux. Even all Nvidia RTX (GTX 16xx too) are getting more love on Linux nowadays.  Features and general improvements are still coming for Vega which I ran until recently. The oldest supported AMD GPUs on Linux are from the HD79xx series (real, not rebranded chips) from around 2012-2013 if I remember.   By supported I meant useful for daily use and normal consumers.  Meaning that all GPUs stated in the video are still completely fine, same goes for the USB-C output of the RX79xx.  In my eyes that's all planned obsolescence which here is irrelevant because of open source drivers. The corporations but also hundreds of free developers take part in.

AMD,Current gen AM5 9000 series Ryzens still have RDNA2 iGPUs lol,Neutral
AMD,"> To not support the series with drivers, when this could render the GPU incompatible with new games is a DISGRACE. I bought my 6650 XT planning to use it until 2027, hoping that my next sub $300 GPU would offer twice the performance and more than 8 GB VRAM. I dont wanna upgrade now, spending $250-300 for 10-50% performance improvements (seriously, the 5050 is barely faster than the 6650 XT in raster) and 8 GB VRAM. I just dont. As such, I guess I'm gonna be stuck using an obsolete and no longer supported card for the mean time.  To be clear, AMD is still providing drivers -- they're just not providing new game-specific driver-level optimizations.  I'm not sure how much this actually matters for older cards, since engine support for RDNA 2 and earlier should be pretty dialed-in to the point where driver-level optimizations shouldn't be as necessary. Not supporting new Vulkan extensions could potentially be problematic, but I'm also not sure it matters if these extensions are meant to support hardware that RDNA 2 cards (and earlier) don't have.  [Vega and Polaris are also in this ""extended support"" phase](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/17qn9e3/amd_begins_polaris_and_vega_gpu_retirement/), and looking at the driver pages for a Vega and Polaris card (I chose the Radeon VII and the Radeon RX 480), their latest driver update was in August 2025, which isn't that long ago. I would be curious to see if owners of these older cards have seen any degraded game experiences beyond just the expected aging.",Negative
AMD,"I feel like this is a bit disingenuous. I hate how expensive graphics cards are as much as the next guy and these business practices are definitely fucked up.   But paying 350 € for a 9060 XT 16 GB in 2025 is like paying 270 € in 2015. That's a crazy good deal for this type of performance, no? What even is a comparable card from 2015 for that price?   Inflation is a real thing. I can't think of many other products with this much performance increase over any specific time period that doesn't shoot through the roof in pricing.  Edit: OP is the kinda pathetic user that blocks people just because they offer a nuanced take in a discussion forum. I hope someone reports them because who needs that kinda behavior on this sub?

AMD,"At first glance you'd think so:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWfMibZ8t00  But there is a catch, HWU did not express themselves clearly, and that was launch review data vs fresh, not fresh vs fresh, and other youtubers stirred a bit of drama, because they couldn't replicate the gains by testing just the drivers. For example:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf1q1nwoj8k  I suspect that the primary reason for rushing game ready drivers is to narrow the range of drivers being used, to make for much easier QA.  Personally I only update when there is promising feature or bugfix to be added, as in last few years nvidia tended to break a lot. This is where I would see issue with slowed down/maintenance drivers. In AMD case people have expectation of FSR feature update for older GPUs and this might mean them not getting it on older hardware if that happens. That'd be a good reason to be upset.",Negative

While she's done good things (or employees under her have, ie: Jim Keller), which include winning contract bids for consoles, the majority (if not the entirety) of the company's success via Ryzen and EPYC, derive from Zen (re: Keller).  She's like a modern day Steve Ballmer, a la Tim Cook; maintaining the status quo, comfortable and complacent, completely devoid of innovation, vision, or the courage to make bold moves which entail risk, often due to fear or cowardice.  Who do you think hired Jack Huynh, the ruthless businessman running Radeon (incl the guy before him, or the guy before that guy, Raja Koduri)? AMD's marketing is beyond embarrassing; they're simply pathetic. Robert Hallock was the only bright spot and he left in order to literally work for their biggest competitor.  You don't think she signs off on (or oversees) key business decisions like pricing, FSR, RT? What about the bumbling launch of Zen 5? Or how they asked influencers on how to price RDNA 4 and for months, the community basically *begged* them to not fuck up another golden opportunity (don't be or pull an AMD), and somehow they were still planning to launch w/ an MSRP of > $700 (\~$750, IIRC), up until the announcement and had to cancel the presentation hours before *during* CES.  Then, after all that, the BEST they managed to do was copy Nvidia (-$50) by listing a fake MSRP, at least in the US, then lied about availability when claiming inventory issues were solely due to demand despite having warehouses full of cards for months from the delayed launch which was due to waiting for Nvidia pricing + selling ALL RDNA 3 inventory to milk RDNA 4 pricing (and not due to the expiring rebates they weren't going to provide retailers or the fact that AIBs would only sell models > $2-300 above MSRP).    Meanwhile, you didn't think it was fishy that  coincidentally they just so happened to conveniently fail to manufacture Reference cards for the first time since I can even remember, meaning that RDNA 3/2/1, Vega, and Polaris ALL had reference cards, so at min dating back at least > a decade)?",Negative

Luckily for Steam Deck owners, they use a driver primarily developed and maintained by Valve (or people paid by Valve), not AMD.",Neutral
AMD,">AMD state they will maintain it for bugs which is all it needs.  That's not what they do. They freeze development by branching the code bases off. This effectively means they no longer do development on the legacy branch.   Even in theory fixing bugs in old unmaintained code is difficult because it stops looking like the cold you're working on on a  regular basis. But in practice they basically never fix bugs outside of the most severe and most basic. Crash fixes to extremely  basic desktop use.  But at a broader general level your statement is incorrect. GPU drivers need constant development because the targets for development constantly change.   A new Vulkan version is imminent (announced by Mesa devs very recently), and RDNA 1 and 2 cards won't get it even though they're fully capable. New DX versions are released  frequently as well, again same issue.  Game development changes and they start using these newer APIs, or they use existing but barely or never used features, triggering issues in drivers due to lack of testing. This happens quite frequently. These GPUs are only a few years old , some 5 years max.   >If a developer is optimizing for RDNA2 and finds a bug AMD will still fix it.   They won't. They don't do any of this in the legacy branch for Vega.  >If AMD wants a new feature to run on these cards they will optimize for it. If there is a new DX12 or Vulkan extension AMD will add it. If a downstream customer has a problem (think Steamdeck, consoles etc) AMD will address it.  They've never done this for the legacy Vega branch. It's stuck at exactly the Vulkan and DX API when they froze development, even though the hardware is far more capable and is fully Vulkan 1.4 compatible along with a long list of other extensions AMD never added.   On Linux the development is partially done by the community and Valve at the kernel level,  and at the usermode level (for Vulkan) it's entirely by the Mesa community and Valve, with no AMD involvement.   As you can guess the driver support on Linux is light-years ahead. Everything from newest rdna4 to GCN 1.0 is still fully supported and updated with constant Vulkan extensions and full scale development broadly at all levels of the driver stack.   Yes this applies to all sorts of GCN hardware because they're extremely capable still. You can do shader emulated ray tracing on Vega and RDNA1 with playable performance.on Linux. There are YouTube videos of people showing Indiana Jones off running on this hardware.  If they were good stewards of the legacy branch you might have a point but they very literally branch it off and freeze it and basically never touch it again.",Negative

Back in the day we used to ACTUALLY see ACTUAL price performance gains where last year's 80 card would be the next's 60 card (for example 980 vs 1060, 580 vs 660). Really, the last time AMD had a product this poorly supported that I bought, you could get a like a 960/970 to replace your old HD 5850. BRAND NEW. Im getting sick and tired of being relegated to a second class citizen for not wanting to spend what used to be GTX 80 money on GPUs and its even worse when these companies dont support what products do exist.",Negative
AMD,"Well to some degree it was to be fair. Because some of their architectures were better suited for games that hadn't been launched yet.   GCN had a terrible CPU bottleneck compared to Maxwell/Pascal in many poorly threaded DX11 games. Which was alleviated by later DX12 games, or in some cases just from games adding DX12 support.   Not like that is only a AMD thing either. Kepler aged poorly as DX11 took over, even on cards that weren't VRAM constrained. Pascal similarly aged poorly vs Turing in many newer DX12 and Vulkan games. The performance didn't change much, just the games used to evaluate performance. Run the original test suite used at Turing launch and you will get the ""not much better for more money"" result again.",Negative
AMD,"And your point? The same happens with Nvidia, driver updates improving performance after product launch.",Neutral

AMD,"Idk ehy isnt this a top comment. Because this is very true whrn I was employed by them. They woukd rather spend more time on their marketing rather than invest in proper teams in software, hardware and QA. They treat their customers like guinea pigs and it seems that their behaviour isnt changed. Best part the parts they had were cheap to make and yet if priced correctly they woukd take the market by a storm. But no they chose to hide everything bin everything down and treat their products like worthless piles of silicon whike sucking up to OpenAI and Co.

AMD,"> On Linux the development is partially done by the community and Valve at the kernel level, and at the usermode level (for Vulkan) it's entirely by the Mesa community and Valve, with no AMD involvement.  I think that's a little bit unfair towards AMD. On the kernel side, they put in the work with amdgpu, writing parts of it from scratch *and* getting it being accepted into the mainline kernel - which is a steep barrier to entry (the battles on the LKML were a fascinating read :) ), but which makes long-term support infinitely more viable due to the nature of Linux kernel development.  On the userland side: While RADV of course has been and still is first and foremost Valve-driven, the no AMD involvement hasn't been true anymore for a while. AMD driver devs have actively contributed to RADV for a while now, and recently they had the saliency to make Mesa RADV the officially supported Vulkan driver, going so far as to actually discontinue AMDVLK. And similar to the kernel side, being part of Mesa means a much higher likelihood of long-term support.",Neutral

I've read that it's due to multi-monitor perhaps but I'm not 100% sure all I know is that all the new drivers do it after 566.36. I updated a couple of days ago to see if it was fixed and it still did it.   It will do it a handful of times a day but it just gets very annoying when I'm trying to watch a film.,Negative
AMD,"Good to hear it is fixed, my issues were BSOD, freeze, display driver constantly crashing and restarting (many people report this as black screen etc, it's just the driver restarting) with the launch driver from the 5060 Ti, 572.something if I remember correctly. I just gave up in the end, I'm not averse to trying to fix things and could understand what was happening quite clearly but nothing seemed to help, going back to a 4000 series card on 566.36 fixed everything.  I assumed it would all be fixed eventually but the card was not usable while this was happening so I just returned it.",Negative
AMD,"I have been surprised by that too, the driver experience I had with a 5060Ti was shockingly bad and I wasn't alone, their forum is full of people having a terrible time with their 2025 drivers. Very few youtubers or writers seemed to cover any of it.  I just returned the card and assumed they'd figure it all out eventually, then I would re-buy... now I'll probably wait until 2026.  I'm not sure it has anything to do with ""focus on AI"" or anything but it's definitely not the driver experience I was used to from Nvidia.",Negative
AMD,"I know and? They are still involved. I just wanted to point at the difference between proprietary platforms (that nowadays shit on their customers as a service) and open source ones. Them theoretically dropping their ""support"" within MESA has less impact than within the same situation on their Windows proprietary driver.  AMD abandoned their first proprietary driver of two (Amdvlk) in June on Linux for their Enterprise users. Amdgpu-Pro will soon follow. They are focusing on RADV now which is open source.  For example I reported an OpenGL bug 1.5 years ago on Vega and the first to take a look over it was someone working for AMD.  Official support drop on Windows: you're screwed on the first issue.  Official ""support"" drop on Linux (open source): If related GPU firmware is open enough, development might just slow down if at all.",Neutral

Even if you could reasonably get that link negotiated and noise free over 5m lengths (a challenge that Valve publicly abandoned), you'd have a consumer cluster fuck of confusion as their standard USB C cables failed to work properly and looked identical.  Quotes from wiki:  > Unlike most alt-modes this remapped A7, A6, B6, B7 to carry a USB 3.0 signal, instead of the usual passive USB 2.0 signal. This means that one would not be able to extend the cable using a standard USB-C 3.0 cable, which has these pins mapped only for unshielded USB 2.0 signals. Also this required the VirtualLink port to also detect the correct orientation of the USB-C plug to ensure that the USB 3.0 TX and RX lanes are correctly connected.  > In VirtualLink mode, there were six high-speed lanes active in the USB-C connector and cable: four lanes transmit four DisplayPort HBR 3 video streams from the PC to the headset while two lanes implement a bidirectional USB 3.1 Gen 2 channel between the PC and the headset. Unlike the classic DisplayPort USB-C alternate mode, VirtualLink has no USB 2.0 channels active, instead providing a higher speed USB 3.1 Gen 2 (SuperSpeed+) over the same A6, A7, B7, B6 pins. VirtualLink also required the PC to provide 15 to 27 watts of power.  > To achieve six high-speed lanes over USB-C, VirtualLink required special cables that conformed to version 1.3 of the USB-C standard and used shielded differential pairs for both USB 2.0 pairs.",Negative

AMD,"i'm pretty sure this sub-branch is a separate thing from the maintenance drivers for those even older cards.  All AMD is doing here is no longer releasing day 1 game drivers with 5000 and 6000 series support. All the normal driver updates will still inlude the 5000, 6000 series.   Those day 1 game driver didn't include optimisations for older GPU's anyway, even if those cards were supported. so really, nothing substantial has chanced, except that AMD's upfront about it.",Neutral

AMD,"Unless there is a huge shift in design philosophy between RDNA5/UDNA, I'd hope they'd drag RDNA4's design forward.  RDNA1/2 are just too primitive when you factor in where the market has been going for since RTX/DLSS entered the scene.  For years I was surprised Youtubers, let alone the audience, didn't call out AMD for basically not moving the needle for features/functions NV was shoehorning everywhere they could leading them to become wanted features.  RDNA4 finally shows up, and the Youtubers in soyjak fashion all pointed and shouted ""AMD finally did it"" as if they should be praised for showing up to the race NV and Intel have been having for the last 2+ years, or if you get honest due to Intel's supply - NV has been solo running for 7+ years.  *EDIT: added a word for clarity",Neutral
AMD,"People comparing 2070S vs 5700XT were already shifting the goalposts.  ""Raster is king"" I believe was coined by GN which basically turned his audience against NV's features.  The 2060S barely lost to the equal priced (after price cut because AMD wanted to put it against the 2070 initially, but the supers blind sided them. Factor in NV even raised the price on the 2060S because AMD tried to release the 5070 XT at $450 [again targeting the 2070] - imagine what a $350 2060S would have done for RTX adoption and directly AMD's margins, AMD should be grateful NV is greedy.)  The RTX 20 series got a bad shake from the Youtubers and yes some of that blame is NV's fault. But by the time DLSS 2.0 rolled around, they should have reflected but rather then investigate these new features and realize their potential they stuck to metrics (I blame laziness - ""you expect us to bench what we do and upscalers too!"") they felt comfortable with and used that to basically mislead their audience through omission.

AMD,Cuz people are so focused on value all the time and only pay attention to immediate value. People don't think about the fact that these are businesses so if a company is taking more money for their product then there's a chance that they also have better services to support the product. It doesn't always mean this but it definitely makes sense. If you have a company that offers really great deals and beats the prices of the competitors all the times then they're probably going to have less than warranty or less than customer support because of the funding.,Neutral

If you actually look at AMD's handling of the GPU division after dissolving ATI, this isn't surprising. At all. If anything, because RDNA4 is more on par with current Intel/NV offerings - it makes more sense.  The real black eye is that AMD continues to drip feed RDNA4 to users so it's not like users can openly embrace RDNA4 which would soften the sting.

AMD,"According to XFX GPU is fine and all issues I have don't fall under warranty  Issue *is* with drivers, okay hotspot temps are bit weird but they are still easily in limit (85-90c) and it's probably just thermal paste since normal temp is perfect and GPU is quite without any throttling.  Driver hang ups happen when alt tabbing and AMD already caused that to result in BSOD twice with drivers.  Issue isn't hardware here, it's software.",Neutral
AMD,"This exhibits a fundamental misconception of why game-specific drivers even exist. Drivers are optimised--***games*** are not. Each new game can make its own nonsensical, non-standard design about how to implement a feature.   Most of the time, nobody cares: old GPU sucks at a new game? Yeah, that tracks. *Obviously*. AMD isn't new to making GPUs nor GPU drivers. However, there are still times when game-specific drivers help.  In the end, AMD is **not** abandoning game-specific drivers: it still offers them for RDNA3 & RDNA4.

They pretty much always focus on their latest two generations.    Doesn't mean there wont still be occasional like 'feature support' things that still get updated, but we're talking specific Day 1 game optimizations.  Which usually contribute a very small boost to performance for certain games and not a whole lot else.",Negative
AMD,">Imagine if Nvidia did this for RTX 30 and RTX 20  They already have. just unannounced.   Edit: it seems people are fundamentally misunderstanding where going on here. AMD is NOT dropping support for 5 and 6000 series, they are just no longer including them in day 1 game driver releases. That's all.   Nvidia might still include older cards in those, but they didn't invest any resources into optimizing then for the game either, so it's pretty pointless.   Literally nothing has changed, except AMD made it clearer that you can skip day 1 drivers when you have a older card.",Neutral

AMD,Resale value is really bad too for AMD GPUs.,Negative
AMD,This has been Nvidia's standard practice forever. lol  Nvidia is not building their Day 1 optimizations for anything but their latest two architectures.  Just cuz you still get access to the newest drivers doesn't mean you're benefiting from them with these optimizations.  My 1070 still has access to the latest drivers.  You really think Nvidia is putting effort into optimizing the newest games for Pascal GPU's? lol,Negative
AMD,"Yeah, as someone who bought a 3090 back in late 2020 and still happily using it, it is insane to think that the AMD equivalent from back then (6900XT) is moving to legacy driver support.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep, artificial obsolete at its finest.",Neutral
AMD,"If you know how to read, RDNA1 & 2 are still supported and will get future drivers.  Nvidia has really gaslighted people into believing that they need bi-weekly ""game-ready-drivers"".    You don't. The majority of the time they make no differences, usually they fix some bugs, and have been validated on the latest hyped AAA game release.   The included performance optimizations are often very insignificant, if they exist at all.",Neutral
AMD,"chill, lmao. overreacting drama queen",Neutral
AMD,Folks holy shit.  You are not losing access to the newest drivers.  You will still have that for years to come.   It's only the (usually fairly small) boosts for Day 1 game specific optimizations that will be limited to newer architectures.,Negative
AMD,Consoles have their own driver and software stack. So they are not effected.  What should be worrying is the steamdeck and the rdna2 based APUs,Neutral
AMD,"Both are rdna2.   And console games are always optimized for the hardware so this doesn't impact them. And Steamdeck is Linux which is probably exempt from this. But the z2a chip in the low end Xbox ally x is rdna2 which is a brand new product, so they're still selling rdna2.",Neutral
AMD,AMD never stated they are working on int4 FSR 4,Neutral
AMD,"No, AMD are freezing all driver development for RDNA 1 and 2. Literally nothing will be changed any more, so expect no new features, and new games to rarely to occasionally not work/crash.  It's been confirmed they're moving these GPUs to the legacy branch, and this is a literal branching of the development tree off, making any backporting of code much more difficult.l, and I highly suspect there will be none.  Legacy branch GPUs only get security exploit fixes, and the very rare crash fixes for extremely basic use cases.   For example the legacy Vega branch aside from security fixes got a few basic fixes to browser video decoding crashes, a Microsoft teams crash fix, I think a Photoshop crash fix and the one game they did a fix for was minecraft, which was a crash fix. That's it.  Alternatively AMD GPUs are still more or less fully supported all the way back to GCN 1.0 on Linux. It's better than nothing.",Negative
AMD,"Feature support like this can still be added.  They are talking purely about Day 1 game optimization stuff that comes with *specific game releases*.  Things that usually dont make a big difference anyways.  Everybody is fearmongering over this like crazy, not understanding a pretty basic and normal situation.",Negative
AMD,This is purely about Day 1 game optimizations.  It's basically all there in the article.,Neutral
AMD,"These optimizations usually only boost performance by a small amount, and with 'it depends' sorts of conditions based on settings and whatnot.

AMD,i think it was the 2080 that performed about the same as a 1080ti but costed more than used or sales pricing of a 1080ti. pascal had huge oversupply issues and they didnt really clear out all those gpus till the 2nd crypto boom after the 30 series launched.,Negative

AMD,I've had very bad experiences before with driver support from AMD in this regard. 2 years later after I bought a laptop they switched to legacy support... That just sucks mate.  I will believe what you say tho... Would hurt really bad to have a card that is unsupported as soon as I bought it...,Negative
AMD,They aren't really overreacting though....a GPU that's just hitting 4 years old and is still being utilized in current gen consoles shouldn't be shafted this soon. Considering the 6000 series was already scarce during the GPU mining craze.,Neutral

It's the same thing that Nvidia does.  All other general driver support will continue.  And it doesn't mean that feature support cant still be added for older GPU's if and when applicable.  You're having a laugh if you think anybody has been going around making driver optimizations for Polaris GPU's in the latest games for Day 1. lol",Neutral
AMD,"That has been my sense as well. For example just recently I updated my drivers for no other reason than it had been over a year. So from that I know my drivers are dated last fall and they dealt with two new games released moths later (stalker 2, poe 2) just fine.   Stalker 2 performance was perfectly in line with professional benchmarkers. It is heavy, but actually smooth compared to many complaining about stutters. In poe 2 I had no problems with the old drivers unlike some of my friends and a lot of the forum folks.  I'm assuming gaming optimizations mostly apply to multiple games with similar engines etc instead of just one game but I could be wrong on that.    That said I really hope they bring official fsr4 to rdna 2. Those cards are basically mostly for 1080 or 1440p and fsr 2/3 fails below 4k so they really could use it even if it isn't super well performing.",Positive

AMD,"IMHO, the biggest practical downside of sticking with 1080Ti isn't lack of raytracing, but lack of modern upscaling. It's still a reasonably capable card, but lack of latest DLSS/FSR means it's effectively knocked a tier lower when compared to cards that do support it.

AMD,"Don't be silly, only knee-jerk reactions are acceptable these days.",Negative
AMD,"I do agree with that, but the only reason I got 6800 at a time was a lack of VRAM on 3070 and 3080. 3080ti with 12gb was enough for my needs (VR), but was out of my price range. I do understand the shit Nvidia does, but from a customer perspective there ain't much difference if they ""downgrade"" a card with their shit naming scheme, if there is no competition.  I got fucked by AMD drivers once when buying a laptop with AMD GPU that got discontinued one year after release, but I let it pass. Don't think I'm going for it again.",Negative
AMD,"Plus the forced obsolescence with low VRAM GPU, they are all evil",Negative
AMD,"What? No. Stop spreading lies. The 750ti was getting game ready drivers for 9 years. We only just got the GTX 1000/Pascal to stop having drivers recently this year and that took 9 years too.

But yeah, If i still have that card today, the only thing I probably would regret from it is the limited 8GB Vram capacity it had, but that is easily solvable by turning down texture settings and using DLSS.

Radeon HD 6000, 5000, 4000 were largely poorly supported in their days. It's been a consistent trend for AMD with only two outliers.",Negative
AMD,AMD has managed day 1 driver support with something? I guess believable with the 580 since it was a rehash of 480.,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, and you expected driver support to inly last 3 years from release? Also there were other rdna2 versions released until 2023 at least.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah may have had the same issue with a friend's card before, told him to just cut losses and sell the card. Not sure why people are quickly jumping to AMD's defence about such issues.",Negative
AMD,"You realize the same argument can be made about the dude complaining about issues with AMD drivers, right?",Neutral
AMD,"well never had to update the driver for a game myself, at least in 20+ years. before that i had to downgrade my nvidia driver though, because only certain old versions were performant.  guess i just don't end up playing games from incompetent devs somehow..? tbh the whole ""game ready"" driver sounds like a marketing spin from nvidia or something. as opposed to ""our driver never worked, so we have to quick fix it now"" -driver.  or is this solely about the modern DSLL or whatever gimmicks, that would need support game-by-game?",Negative
AMD,And care to provide a source for this claim? Even if it doesnt come with optimizations some games would not let you launch without specific driver versions,Negative
AMD,"It's depressing that you're getting downvoted for this, just like me.   Folks here dont know what they're talking about.   I'm still getting access to 'Game Ready drivers' for my damn GTX1070. lol  Imagine how ridiculous I'd have to be think that meant Nvidia was genuinely working to optimize games around my 9 year old GPU. lol",Negative

AMD,Oh unbelievable. I forgot about this card completely. A good find.  Absolutely insane. 2 years of game-specific updates is ***nothing*** for a $300+ GPU.,Positive
AMD,"No, it's about them not being included in day 1 game specific driver releases.  Which aren't needed in 99% of cases anyway, and only bring marginal performance increases.  It's a storm in a teacup.",Negative
AMD,"Yes and yes. They really should rename it to ""standard support"" or something.",Neutral
AMD,This is specifically for *day one* drivers. Chill out and learn how to read the article.,Neutral
AMD,Read the article man.  Bug fixes and general driver support are continuing.  This is purely about Day 1 game optimizations.  Which usually dont do a ton anyways.,Neutral
AMD,">bux fixes  Tbh those never existed, I can't think of a single issue I had that was fixed on my 6750XT that was down to drivers",Negative
AMD,"I want a better upscaler not a worse one, even if it's not a huge difference. The FP version is already as fast or faster on RDNA3 in Linux and much faster on RDNA4, so the only reason to keep developing the INT8 one is PS5 Pro and RDNA2 (which is pretty borderline for performance as an official product).    AMD should release a super light version for handhelds but I don't know if it will have that much in common with the leaked INT8 code or not.",Positive
AMD,"You're misunderstand what I'm saying, I'm not trying to conflate two cards. Just that ""Still being sold"" isn't really a useful statement about age, as you can find new stock of pretty much any card from the last 20 years if you look for them.  And honestly I think this entire thing is odd, ~~and the translated statement quoted in the top post seems to contradict other statements made from other AMD sources (namely the rep on the discord - I saw a screenshot of their comment I'm trying to find now to reference that said it was only *new feature* support that would be lacking from rdna1&2 - which likely makes sense as in the latest release that kicked off all this shenanigans the ""new features"" were primarily AI-specific ops that don't have hardware support on those devices).~~  EDIT: I still can't find the source, though I'm pretty sure I didn't imagine it, and the only AMD discord I could find doesn't even seem to have the user I remember from the screenshot (""AMD_Vik"" I think?). Though at the end of the day, a screenshot is just a screenshot, not evidence of anything :P  However on that (official) discord there was:  > ""We’d like to inform you that the release notes for AMD Software Adrenalin Edition 25.10 2 posted included misinformation that has since been corrected. There is no change to USB-C functionality on the RX 7900 series GPUs in the 25.10.2 driver. There was an incorrect line in the originally posted release notes that has been removed, and the release notes have been updated.""  Which kinda makes one of yesterday's big drama posts void? And kinda makes me wonder who the fuck AMD have *writing* these ""release notes""? Especially if this current ""dropping support for RDNA1&2"" also turns out to be less than feared.",Negative
AMD,Hey in his defense the 1050 released nine years ago probably outsells any AMD GPU.   Lolz.,Neutral

AMD,"No, D3D12 feature sets and/Vulkan extensions are introduced by newer driver versions, along with new Shader Models and shader compiler optimizations. This has nothing with “incompetent developers”, it’s nature of graphics programming.  And bugs within certain driver versions happen constantly, this is software just like anything else on the market, bugs are bound to happen.",Negative
AMD,"Driver notes for specific game day optimizations usually go over this.  I really thought this was like totally common knowledge by PC gamers paying attention to this stuff.  It's one of the reasons that if all else is roughly equal, buying a newer gen GPU over an older gen GPU is usually worth it.  Means about two more years of focused optimizations(not that this usually makes a huge difference anyways, but it's welcome).  Because Nvidia absolutely drops specific 'Day 1 game optimizations' support for older GPU's.    And again, nobody is talking about getting rid of \*access\* to newer drivers.  Only that specific Day 1 optimizations built within are optimized for newer architectures.  Which is exactly how Nvidia has worked for a long time.  Nobody is 'lying' here, y'all are just not understanding the situation.",Neutral
AMD,He tried to look at your profile for ammunition against you but your profile is set to private.,Neutral
AMD,"because you dont need the extra hardware in blackwell and lovelace for framegen? just like how REBAR support could work on turing and volta GPUs with a firmware update but nvidia refused to do it because those cards were on tier2/3 support at the time, or how nvidia refused to add vesa adaptive sync support to maxwell when the hardware had displayport 1.2 support.  its a pattern of tier2/3 support for cards 2 generations or older. idk why people are convinced theyre still working hard on them. just because theyre in the same driver package doesnt mean anything.",Neutral
AMD,"This comment section has gone insane misunderstanding this situation.   It's wild.  You're like one of three other people who seems to understand this.    Nvidia doesn't support these Day 1 optimizations for older architectures, either.  It's the exact same practice from them since forever and yet so many comments are like ""This is why I buy Nvidia!"". lol Utter depressing hilarity.",Negative
AMD,Does it make a difference? Didn't I pay for support? I'm second class citizen? This is why companies treat us like dirt: we accept sub-par customer service.,Negative
AMD,Legitimately there's only two products that AMD supported long term:  HD 7000 series (and the rebranded R9 200 series which was just HD 7000 all over again)  RX 400/500 series   That's it. Entire history of the company.,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, replied to wrong post ^^",Neutral
AMD,"no i mean this is very simple. if you use an old card for a new game, it will work. if it doesn't, the game dev is incompetent as they are throwing free revenue away.  it is primarily in the interest of the game devs for their game to work (well), and their job to make it happen. the only actual case where the consumer can expect an issue is if the card is just too weak (or extremely old so the dev won't bother).",Neutral
AMD,"oh, that's exactly why I set it private. I'm sick of people who get upset at me going through my history.",Negative
AMD,"Why are you here making up conspiracy theories about something that's well known and easy to check? Yes, you do need the hardware to run framegen, otherwise you lose more FPS than you'd gain.",Negative

AMD,You are STILL getting general driver support.    Y'all dont understand that going through every new major game and trying to tweak and optimize complicated driver code just to eek out some small percentage of extra performance is a ton of work.  And now multiply that effort for basically every generation of GPU architecture that you want to do this for.   This is why it's been standard practice from Nvidia forever to ALSO only focus their Day 1 game optimizations on their latest two generations.,Negative
AMD,"> Didn’t I pay for support?  Actually, no, you didn’t. You paid for a product with the assumption of support, which has been *marginally* reduced. And buying AMD shouldn’t come with any support assumptions given their poor track record.  Without an announcement you wouldn’t even have noticed, game-ready drivers are a nothing burger. AMD support has been an issue but *this* isn’t worth getting that upset over.  Edit: some of y’all find this so offensive that you leave comments that the mods have to remove. Take a chill pill",Negative
AMD,"Cool theory, the practice of working with graphics APIs and drivers is drastically different.  Even code that passes validation layers and is perfectly according to specs may not work on particular driver versions or not perform well. There’s a reason graphics vendors have teams dedicated to AAA games support.  And even old GPUs do receive new API extensions from time to time. You aren’t going to implement them without proper driver support.",Neutral
AMD,framegen on 30 and 20 series is a conspiracy now? so fsr3 and xess fg dont exist in your world then?,Neutral
AMD,"With this mindset, we deserve sub-par support if none at all then. Amazing. This world is fucked.",Negative
AMD,yeah? then the non-AAA games still happen to work just by magic alone? and the dev is certainly unable to adjust the code themselves to work around bugs in the driver?,Negative

AMD,"> New features, bug fixes and game optimizations will continue to be delivered as required by market needs in the maintenance mode branch.  This is the statement AMD gave to TH. TH is assuming this means day-zero updates and reporting as if that is factually the case.",Neutral
AMD,"This to me is just a fine example of corporate weasel wording. ""New features, bug fixes and game optimizations will continue to be delivered as required by market needs in the maintenance mode branch"" does not in any way mean that RDNA1 and RDNA2 cards will get game optimizations. AMD after all can simply deem that ""market needs"" do not include optimizations for ""insert popular game of the year number 2"" , only ""game number 1"" in 2026, and no games after that.   So no, unless they fully commit to providing game optimizations and full game driver support for an architecture that launched five years ago and is still being shipped in mobile and other products in 2025, I don't buy it. It's about trust, and lack of it.",Negative
AMD,Me when I shoot myself in the foot then realized I may have needed that foot,Neutral
AMD,"To be honest, dropping RDNA1 was fair, but RDNA2 was dumb.  There is a gaming handheld being sold **brand new, right now** that ships with RDNA2, the Xbox ROG Ally. Making a 2nd class citizen out of a device that just launched in late 2025 is just dumb AF.  AMD could have probably avoided this blowback if they were just more aggressive in their GPU strategy for their APUs. Like, there shouldn’t have been a new RDNA2 APU in 2025, full stop. Also, it doesn’t make sense for other modern APUs to still be RDNA3 or 3.5 this late in the hardware lifecycle. If AMD/Radeon were actually firing on all cylinders, RDNA4 APUs should have already released by now.",Negative

AMD,"Okay to translate a bit to what this means: so....They're gonna make sure the games work, but again no optimizations. What does this mean? Well look at the typical amd ""fine wine"" arguments, amd often continues to optimize drivers for games while nvidia will still provide driver updates, but won't optimize for older architectures. That's why the gtx 600/700 series started lagging behind say, amd's 7000/200 series and the 900/1000 series started lagging behind the 400/500 series. Nvidia stopped specific optimizations for older cards while amd continued them. This meant amd cards often started performing better than older equivalent nvidia cards.  Amd won't be providing game level optimizations but will stlil provide driver support to ensure the games work.  To be fair nvidia probably does this too. I could see then optimizing for 4000/5000 series but whatever the 2000/3000 get they get. Nvidia tends to focus on their newest 1-2 architectures and whatever happens to the older ones happens. Doesn't mean nvidia stops providing driver support, they just won't get ""game optimizations."" You know what I'm saying?",Neutral
AMD,We need Vulkan support as well!

AMD,"They are really not.    I dont know what people think is going on here, but when Nvidia/AMD offer 'Day 1 Game optimizations', they are for specific major releases, where they take some extra effort to try and boost what performance they can from their end of things, via driver tweaks and optimizations.  It usually doesn't even amount to a whole lot, and often only for specific situations.   You do NOT need these 'Day 1 game optimizations' to run games properly.  They are basically a nice little perk.   And the point of only focusing on the latest architectures is that they can put more priority and effort into them, granting some presumably slightly better results in doing so.   It really is exactly what Nvidia have been doing forever.  Many people seem to not understand that just cuz they get access to the latest 'Game Ready Driver' or whatever does not mean there's anything in that driver that will benefit you if you're on a somewhat older generation GPU.  I'm still getting Nvidia driver updates for my GTX1070, but I'd be a fool to think Nvidia were actually still taking any effort to optimize things in the very latest games for Pascal GPU's! lol   It's absolutely insane how people are overreacting to this.",Negative
AMD,"They are irrelevant unless a game has severe bugs.  Because Nvidia slapped a marketing term on it (""game ready"") people think hardware has to have updated drivers to support software.  It's completely asinine.  You might as well say you need a new printer driver for every new program you print from.",Negative
AMD,AMD still updates the drivers for Vega. You guys just love to doom and gloom.,Negative
AMD,"Losing 5-10% performance is exactly the problem, given how heavy modern games are and how popular RDNA2 is. Sure, RDNA1 doesn't support DX12 ultimate and can't handle mesh shaders, maybe you can make an argument about moving that to maintenance branch. But RDNA2?   I could've begrudgingly accepted this sun-setting had it been done in October of 2027, when the RX6000 series would've turned seven years old. But two years after last RDNA2 dGPU launch? With RDNA2 powered APUs, devices and laptops being launched in 2025? With RDNA2 RX6600 being the most popular AMD card in Steam hardware survey?   Sorry, basic game driver support with AMD's track record regarding maintenance drivers is not enough for me as a consumer at this point in time, and I will absolutely hold it against a company that cuts support far sooner than the competition. AMD can afford to provide full game driver support for an architecture they are using in current products for another year or two.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah this is my take on it too. 6000 series will get normal driver support, just not the specific optimizations for games. Basically they took away the ""fine wine"" but still support the product generally, kinda like how nvidia does for older architectures.",Neutral
AMD,"I keep seeing AMD doing the hard work then somehow screwing up the last mile - often in communication (be it with consumers or other devs).  There are some simple uncontroversial facts - ""Newer hardware"" has more development focus than older hardware. Some feature work requires hardware support from more recent devices. This is true for every vendor, not really mentioned but generally understood, even if not consciously, by the community. Even if they had a million more skilled engineers eclipsing any possible competition, there would still be that bias in focus.  But then AMD keep shouting those facts in the absolute *worst* way possible, making it easy to dunk on them and get headlines, and any ""clarification"" just sounds like weaselly corporate backtracking.  It's super frustrating for someone who works in the industry (and even used to work on AMD drivers). And honestly, not just this ""marketing""-level communication - I have pretty big issues in other areas that may be less obvious to consumers, they seem to pay for the majority of the work, then spoiling everything in the last mile by doing something dumb like banning interaction with gamedevs not through a single small overworked team that you know will *never* get around to your request, even if it could save *significant* development time.  Maybe AMD just *really* don't want to be a consumer device company? And *really* want to sell IP to others who them productize? But that doesn't seem to match their strengths - it feels like they could do so much better with *so little* effort.",Negative
AMD,This is irrelevant to consoles.    Steam Deck is Linux.,Neutral
AMD,"Because RDNA 1 is older, nowhere near as widespread (RDNA 1 is only in the RX 5000 series, a fairly small generation, whilst RDNA 2 is in RX 6000, a big one, AND APUs, AND consoles!), and is missing key hardware features (namely mesh shaders and hardware RT) which means it’s aging pretty poorly.",Negative
AMD,"RDNA1 is old enough at this point, without support for DirectX 12 Ultimate.

AMD,"They at least pretend to care, and have for decades.   Even RTX 2000 series gets the latest DLSS upscaling. AMD legitimately leaked a FSR4 build that's compatible with RDNA2/3 yet pulled it like it never existed.  Also, 7% may sound small, but nVIDIA reported $130b revenue.

AMD,"1070 is 9 years old, RDNA2 was refreshed 3 years ago, yes it's not necessary but still a slap in the face, especially considering the overwhelming feature gap between RDNA2 and RTX 30 series and even the older RTX 20 series which got partial support for DLSS 4.",Neutral

AMD,"Not at all, as a printer either works or it doesn't, they each have their own driver, but they interact with windows in the same way, the same printer popup appears for formatting the print and vinfirming the size, whether it's portrait or landscape, etc.  Each game engine had different demands on the hardware that impact different architectures in different ways.  If it was as easy as you claim there would just be a standard driver for everything and it would automatically run great on everything.",Neutral
AMD,Why not expect the game developers actually doing that work and optimise their code for the target HW?,Neutral
AMD,"You're not 'losing' performance that you never had, though.  Another thing that's important to note here is that throughout a GPU generation's lifetime, vendors are constantly trying to improve *general* performance via drivers.  After 2-3 years, these optimizations are usually pretty mature, and thus there's simply much less juice to squeeze out of older architectures with any kind of game-specific optimizations.  As for holding this against AMD, again, this is Nvidia's standard practice for a long time.  It makes perfect sense to prioritize newer architectures in newer games where there's perhaps more juice to squeeze, and can maybe even learn and improve general driver gains as well.  Y'all are so stuck on your initial outrage-based reactions, you're obviously going to keep trying to argue this somehow, though.  Cant admit you're wrong on the internet!",Neutral
AMD,Yeah I aint super happy about this especially since 6000 series cards were offered next to 7000 series for most of their lifespan but at least it isn't cutting driver support entirely. I would agree 2027 is a more reasonable timeline to start sunsetting rdna2.,Negative
AMD,"It’s pretty clear that AMD sees the enthusiast graphics card consumer as a test market for newer features they’ll later productize for console and other licensed products. It makes sense too - big orders at higher margins, and lower potential losses (no buybacks) if the end product doesn’t perform well.  Now that PS6 development is in full swing, it makes sense that they’re redirecting their dev resources toward the resources that will actually apply to that GPU.",Neutral
AMD,AMD of course have plenty of deficiencies compared to Nvidia in terms of software support.   But this example isn't one of them.  They're literally matching Nvidia's standard practice.,Negative
AMD,"Yeah thanks I'm aware the PS5 doesn't run Windows.  What I'm saying is, this is a supported product in some sense, why drop support solely for Windows?  That's confusing.  Plus they probably have team members actively familiar with RDNA2, surely some of that knowledge is portable across operating systems from an institutional standpoint.  Obviously there is additional Windows specific work that will need to be done, which has a cost, but again probably still easier than if Windows was the only platform these chips were used in.",Neutral

Either way, people are very quick to accept how the news dropped while RDNA 1 having (stated) updates a month ago wasn't even an afterthought, I find it a bit bizarre.",Negative
AMD,Right.  Nvidia has always 'supported' Day 1 optimizations for their two most recent generations.  And that's it.  Exact same thing.    It would take insane amounts of human resources to optimize every game for every generation of GPU with very unique and game-specific Day 1 driver optimizations.  Of course they have to prioritize.    This probably isn't even a new practice for AMD.,Neutral

Again, I think you're very much not understanding what the role of these 'driver optimizations' are.  They are 'extra boosts' when possible, and even then, those boosts are often quite limited and/or situational.  Even if what you're saying was true, it would still be crazy to be hiring entire armies of software engineers working on every single unique generation of GPU of the last 5-10 years with each new major release, just for some smallish gains in some situations.

And the kernel that needs to be ""compromised"" is not the kernel of the customer, the person adding the shim can briefly boot the system from their own drive to compromise the system.  In that sense, the attack is not unrealistic at all, the owner of a machine can easily take it offline for half an hour, add the shim, boot it from a portable drive for long enough, and then put it back into operation.",Neutral
AMD,"That isn't particularly relevant here, from my understanding. The attack doesn't care where the data is going to, just whether they can tap into the interface and whether the encryption used is susceptible to replay attacks. The storage still sits in DRAM in the Apple design, and that data has to travel over the DRAM interface, which is susceptible to a physical MITM actor grabbing information. The main differentiator here would be whether or not the encryption is deterministic, which is where this particular vulnerability becomes effective (because once you've grabbed the right transaction, it can be used repeatedly).  From what the researchers are saying, client-side SGX used to use non-deterministic encryption; however, as the scope of protected memory ballooned (esp with TDX's use case on server), that shifted to deterministic encryption to limit the performance impact for memory regions that large. Presumably, Apple doesn't need to contain entire programs within their secure enclave (same as Intel with the original client design), so there's a good chance this attack doesn't work on them for those reasons instead.",Neutral
AMD,"It's only become a key selling point in a specific context. Which is essentially ""people who don't know what they're talking about talking to people who lack the expertise to verify their claims"".   These kind of TEE type countermeasures, like any countermeasures, always have a specific threat model and specific security guarantees. Which, as the article points out, never really included physical tampering attacks or even side channels.  The problem is once it stops being security experts talking to security experts those details are almost immediately lost. People find it all very niggly and boring and overly detailed and full of caveats and very few concrete guarantees.   So it gets simplified. The caveats get forgotten. The details get smoothed out. Things that were ""Guarantee X under condition Y assuming 1, 2, 3, 4"" become guarantee X.  Aaaaand you get this sort of thing where some researcher proves that you can do nasty things outside of condition Y or when 3 isn't true or something. People cry foul ""but you guaranteed X under all conditions!"" and the people in the know go ""no we fucking didn't"" and point to a security spec that literally nobody ever read besides them.

It will affect games which use more, as having the same amount of cache on both CCD's means there's no need for one CCD to constantly request data from the other CCD.  The main games that will benefit, however, are those few which don't schedule properly by default and therefore have poor results with the 12-core and 16-core X3D parts compared to the 8-core part.  They run properly with something like *Process Lasso*, which no reviewer uses for some bizarre reason, but with this part, that won't be necessary.",Neutral

AMD,"Maybe? The performance gains were honestly way more than expected from a CPU, I would have assumed they would be mostly all gpu bound and there wouldn't be such a huge change. It's a big change from normal cpus so I wouldn't assume that it couldn't improve. It was honestly pretty stunning performance results.",Positive
AMD,"That's well within the margin of error.

That's not even counting whether every graphic setting is the same as what you're using.",Neutral
AMD,"Sure, scheduling \_could\_ usually fix the issue here, but some games also use more than 8c/16t and spill over anyway.  One could manually force those apps to use a subset of CPU.  Or you can not worry about any of that and just have it work without any fuss.  In particular, if your background task also likes cache, this is a win.   Additionally, it should be faster overall than a normal 9950X3D if you run power limited to say, 150W, since the 3D cache chips tend to be quite a bit more power efficient below 80W per CCD.",Neutral
AMD,"Gaming is likely the worst possible example of how this addition can be taken advantage of, simply because of gamers' habits:  - Gaming is typically done on Windows, an OS with task scheduling so silly, it's still a pain in the ass to use long existing server CPUs with it exposing many cores. Cache-aware scheduling is experimental even on Linux, Windows just won't catch up any soon.  - Games are incredibly sloppily written, and typically only optimized until the performance is considered good enough on the most common setups. Windows doesn't even offer tools to mitigate bad strategies like creating tons of threads beyond the point of reasonable scaling, unlike tools offered by Linux like a cgroup with only the X3D CCD being visible, or similarly Wine being instructed to limit the visibility of cores not desired to be used. Letting the game see 32 hardware threads, resulting in multiple layers of abstractions create 32 software threads each, and just confining them them to a single CCD with something like Process Lasso just doesn't compare.  - Even with a good scheduler, what's the point of having 2 higher performance CCDs for the use case of one performance sensitive task with many background tasks the user doesn't even care about much? Typically there's only one game running the user is focusing on, and background bloatware will spill out of the extra cache anyway.",Negative

AMD,"The lower cache is why the requests have to be made frequently.  You have 96MB of L3 on one CCD, and 32MB on the other CCD.  If a thread on the latter needs data cached on the former, it will retrieve it over the IF link, which is slower than a local cached read, but still faster than a DRAM access (which is why the request is made in the first place).  That will then be the newest line of memory, being stored in the L1/L2 of the core that requested it, kicking out the oldest line into the L3, which in turn kicks out the oldest L3 line.  When that latter evicted line is needed again, it will have to be refetched.  It's still likely in the L3 of the first CCD, due to that being triple the size, so it will be requested over the IF link again.    But if both cache sizes are the same, then that scenario will happen much less often.  Both CCD's will end up having mostly the same cache lines stored locally, and only if the data is invalidated (which won't happen to most of the read-only memory involved with running a game) would there need to be a cross-CCD transfer for the same cache line.  There's still room for particular code to not run all that well in that scenario, but it's likely uncommon.  Worst case scenario, you just relegate such a game to a single CCD using *Process Lasso* or some other means of managing process affinity on the fly.  All of this is obvious when you compare the performance of non-X3D 16-core parts to the equivalent 8-core part.  In nearly all games, there's no real difference.  Only occasionally does the performance suffer on the dual-CCD part.  It's in those scenarios where a dual-X3D processor might not do as well, though there are certainly other variables that affect the outcome.",Neutral
AMD,"This is Reddit. We don't do that here, though in hindsight it is a bit embarrassing when the article is so short...

AMD,"If your other tasks also like the cache, it makes sense.  Or if you want to lower the power down to 150W for all-thread tasks, 3D2 should start consistently beating the 9950X3D since the latter won't have a clock speed advantage and the former will keep the cache advantage",Neutral

AMD,"I was strictly talking about the actual listed numbers. AMD will also go above if you let it.  The 230W has nothing to do with PBO. Its the default PPT set for 170W TDP parts, they \*will\* draw 230W when maxed out under default settings. (I'm also fairly sure most boards don't ship with a modified PBO enabled anyway.)  AMD's listed TDP is a calculation based on various factors. Intel's listed TDP is just their base power limit (which as you've noted they don't tend to stick to). The numbers are not comparable because they're based on different things and in AMD's case is almost entirely unrelated to power draw.",Neutral

AMD's TDP is a (relatively complex) formula, effectively detached from either its base or boost power draws, it also is not impacted by their boost algorithm. They're not comparable numbers.

AMD,"> Intel originally claimed E-cores would boost multi-threaded performance at low area cost without hurting single-thread (since P-cores take priority).   That's true, but it goes even further.    Heterogenous cores actually *increase* single threaded performance in the long term. That's because the die area penalty for making P cores bigger decreases when there's only 8 P cores instead of 16-24+ of them. And a bigger core is usually a more performant core.    This is probably why Intel is ok with their P cores being enormous compared to AMD.",Positive
AMD,"4 e-cores take up as much space as 1 p-core, for multithreading they genuinely do provide better performance per mm square in many applications.  They also use less power than p-cores.  The goal hasn't changed from when they first arrived on the scene. Its all about chasing efficiency while keeping peak performance as high as possible in the applications that benefit from high single threaded performance.",Positive
AMD,"Heterogenous cores are really a byproduct of increasing core counts. PPA = Power, Performance, Area. The idea is to have different cores be optimized for different parts of this ratio.  If you have a physically large core that can provide very high performance at the expense of large area and high power consumption, than this design may not scale well with more cores.  If you have ""E"" cores that sacrifice maximum clockspeed for smaller area and lower power consumption, than you can often get better nT performance in the same area because in reality, once you're loading more than 6 or 8 cores, clockspeed delta between the P and E cores drops a lot.   For Intel's new P-E-LpE design, each is optimized to target a different part of the PPA.",Neutral
AMD,"Apple does it for battery life. They kinda have to. They were building SOCs for phones years before they took it to computers. Most of the work that is done on the CPU for day to day stuff can be handled by the efficiency cores with line 1/10 the power. You don’t need the P cores for most things except for short bursts where faster app load times and things like that matter.   Intel is of course trying the same thing, but the problem Intel is having is that they’re clocking the regular E cores too high, and as a result they’re running them past their optimal voltage range where they are truly more efficient by a large margin. When run at more modest clock speeds like 2.5ghz, they are significantly more efficient in terms of performance per watt. At 3.7ghz, they still lead over the P cores, but only barely in that power/performance band.   So intel is moving more towards using LPE cores, basically lower clocked E cores on a low power island, to truly help battery life. Which seems to be working. For battery life, that should have been their focus from the beginning. The higher clocked E cores are mostly for multithreaded performance.   On the desktop though, I don’t see the point as much.  Power budgets are higher. Intel is running the E cores past their optimal clocks/voltages anyway on these desktop SKUs, the actual performance per watt improvement is smaller than it looks because of that. Helps with area efficiency though, and if they clock them more sanely, you get some really great chips on the E-core Xeon lineup.   AMD’s approach is way different. The C cores are the exact same architecture as their full performance optimized brethren, but they use like half the power at equivalent performance and clock 30-40% lower. That’s because AMD is physically laying out the core differently at the transistor level, and is using different libraries to implement the circuitry that are designed for lower power rather than higher transistor switching times (a lot of people don’t know  this, but a “node” at a fab isn’t really just one set of transistors that get used everywhere. When fabs like TSMC create a new node, they also create several different “libraries” that chip designers can use that have different transistor densities, different switching times, and different power profiles, even on the same node. Desktop SKUs often use performance oriented libraries for faster transistor switching times and higher clock speeds, but these transistors are physically larger and use more power, even on the same node. What Zen 4C/5C is doing is implementing the exact same core architecture with a more power optimized design at the fab/transistor/node-library level, which is smart. If you can pull that off on laptop chips and get the same IPC at significantly higher power efficiency, it makes sense.)   Apple frankly still just does it better. Apple’s efficiency cores are amazing. They get skylake-class performance using like 0.25-0.4 watts each. I don’t even know how they pulled that off. Intel’s E cores exceed Skylake performance too, but they use several times the power of Apple’s E cores to do it.",Neutral
AMD,"If I got that right, many programs (or part of them) only use simple instructions, which is part of the reason why M chips are hot now. But using simple instructions in a complex core is more costly. Additionally, many computations are memory bound and not CPU bound, hence why we are seeing high performance CPUs with way more cache. So having lower capability and lower speed cores to do these tasks is fine because they can't be much faster anyway. And ideally these so-called E-cores are more efficient as well.",Neutral
AMD,"You basically said it, e Cores don't make much sense in a low power design.  More general, the are two aspects that a CPU architecture can be designed around: throughput and latency.   Throughput means how much work can you do in a given amount of time and latency focuses on how much time do you need to finish a task.   Even though they seem to be similar, they're not. Power consumption scales with the square of clock speed. Increasing clockspeed by 2x requires 4x power, so you either have 1 core twice as fast or 4 cores running at the same speed. That's extremely oversimplified but gives a rough estimation on why it's generally much easier to get good throughput over latency.  Apart from that there are interconnects. CPUs cores share memory and caches to some degree and in todays designs, moving data typically costs more energy than compute does.   It's a complicated topic and I strongly recommend this [Video](https://youtu.be/8teWvMXK99I?si=i4BrzCp6kjsZn8RW) by Dr.Cutress which goes over the intrerconnect basics. Long story short, the more cores/hops you add your design the worse latencies get.   And that's also a reason why intel uses e cores. Intel generally targets latency more than throughput while AMD typically focuses more on throughput (there are exceptions on both). But still, both try to reduce latency as much as possible, both designs have their advantages and drawbacks.  Intel uses a high speed ring to connect their cores. Problem is that adding more hops will increase latency. Fun fact if you look at more technical analyses of Alder Lake, you'll find that the 6 core dies usually come with better core to core, cache and memory latencies than their high end many core designs do. To enable higher core counts, which are mostly useful for throughput heavy tasks anyway, they group 4 e cores into one hop on the ring. That means they can add 4 cores that have more throughput than 1 big core while only increasing throughput as much as adding one more core which is a pretty good idea.   But all that is only really useful on higher end parts, for low core count or limited power scenarios it's not that useful. Even though their marketing did present it a little bit different the e cores were never really about efficiency in low power scenarios.  AMD solves this problem quite different: They only build 8 core ""cpus"" and ""glue"" them together on one package and connect them through a cache coherent interface. Topology wise they act more like older dual socket systems before the North bridge was integrated into the chip. The IOD is basically the north bridge and each CCD acts like a CPU socket would but all at much higher speeds and lower latencies. But there are still issues.   The cache is only coherent, not shared. If both CCDs work on the same memory, the data in stored in both caches as copies. That's also the reason why the Ryzen 9 CPUs have twice the cache over Ryzen 7 CPUs but don't see any benefit in gaming from that. If anything, the coherent caches hurts low latency applications like gaming.   AMD ""fixes"" that by disabling one CCD in those tasks. And that's also one the reasons why Zen 3 improved so much in gaming: they went from 4 core CCX to 8 core CCX which also doubled the effective cache. Instead of 2x 16MB it was 1x 32MB since then.  So, heterogenous designs are relevant for scaling performance on the desktop.   In mobile systems, it can also be used to reduce power draw but that's an entirely different thing.  ARMs big.LITTLE which is often falsely compared to intels design works entirely different from what intel and AMD are doing. The orginal big.LITTLE was more like power settings than anything else.     Edit: Technically every single SMT/hyperthreading CPU is heterogeneous. From the OS perspective SMT is much more heterogeneous and a much bigger issue than big.LITTLE ever was.",Neutral
AMD,"I think that the exact motives for heterogeneous solutions vary from case to case.  E.g. if you look at AMD vs Intel, I think that Intel went with a heterogeneous design because they didn't have any other way to compete with AMD. AMD's Zen cores were already quite power efficient, while Intel was stuck with older designs for older nodes that were more power hungry, so they could not scale up the number of cores without making a power monster (plus it wouldn't fit on a reasonably priced die). Their solution became a hybrid design with a few powerful cores and a few less powerful cores.  In the case of Intel, it's quite clear that it was an emergency solution. They basically took two more or less readily available cores and put them on the same die. One quirk that came from that was that even if the bigger cores had some CPU extensions (some AVX instructions for instance), the smaller cores didn't. That meant that processes and threads could not be migrated from big cores to small cores without possibly crashing. IIRC the solution was simply to disable the advanced instructions in the big cores and have a more crippled CPU.  One observation that has been made in recent times is that in a multi-core CPU, you don't really need that many fast cores for your system to run fine. I think that Linus Torvalds expressed it something like this: ""The important thing is that the efficiency cores do not suck"" (i.e. that there's not an order of magnitude difference in performance, because then scheduling becomes really difficult).  For Apple I think they come from another reality, where their big-little design was first made for phones and tablets, where battery life is a key design goal. There it's important to have cores that draw little power to extend battery life as much as possible, and only use the big cores for interactive foreground processes for instance.",Neutral

So while they are very good at the single thread part they are inefficient for dealing with highly parallel or concurrent algorithms where the mass of E cores gets more work done in the same area and power. Lots of E cores is better for more parallel work, but if you have too few P cores that can hurt performance due to [Amdahl's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl's_law).  The thing about Amdahl's law is once you have enough parallel processors the task becomes dominated by the single thread part of the work, which is the setting it up and collecting the results and showing them to the user/storing them. So the ideal future involves the right amount of P cores to as many E cores as possible, but if you have too few P cores and that work ends up on E cores it will hurt performance. Too many P cores and you end up with less performance in the parallel part of the work.  Heterogenous cores is thus the obvious future as things become more concurrent and we use more parallel algorithms. Get the balance wrong and performance will suffer, we need just enough P cores to run the E cores. We also need the right thread scheduling to get this all correct and I think its going to fall on the programmers to hint where threads should go because its very hard for the OS to choose.  The final aspect is modern machines spend a lot of time idle, and idle work is rarely timely or needing a lot of performance. So there is an ultra low power low performance core need too that keeps the OS and notifications and apps ticking over and keeps power consumption really low.",Neutral

AMD,Fwiw aren't the e cores about the same size as Ryzen big cores too? Intel needs to shrink stuff,Neutral
AMD,"This doesn't make any sense to me.  The ARM instructions are the same no matter the core. Bigger cores use their resources to look farther and farther ahead to find instruction-level parallelism. As it turns out, there are diminishing returns for this, so an E-core with 1/4 the area can still get the majority of the IPC.  The cache has nothing to do with the instruction set and everything to do with counteracting the performance hit of sequential RAM speeds maxing out at ~400MHz years ago. Again though, it has diminishing returns, so having less cache affects performance, but having 1/4 the cache doesn't mean 1/4 the performance.  Maybe you are talking about pathologically serial pieces of code. This also doesn't generally apply. There are some edge cases, but there is almost always some amount of ILP that can be applied. Additionally, E-cores are generally half the clockspeed which means they would be half as fast at the same serial IPC limit.",Negative
AMD,"On the M series chips, the E cores and P cores have the same instruction set. They just are scaled differently. An app that can run on one can run on the other just fine.

Whereas with Intel, even if the microarch itself is the same, there's very little overlap between their desktop & server designs. The cores' designs are fundamentally different because in the server dies, they're connected together using a mesh layout instead of using a ringbus. Much more complex & expensive than a ring, but let's them scale out to more than 8-10 cores per die and maintain a relatively consistent c2c latency, albeit the lower bounds are higher.",Neutral

Honestly, I think Intel should’ve gone with a 2P + 8E layout instead of the usual 4P + 4E on many past U15 chips.

AMD's dense cores are not nearly small enough in comparison to their classic cores to really increase core count with the die savings they create. Or at least the dimensions don't really lineup well on the die. Their strategy, in client at least, seems to be much more just saving a bit in cost, than actually increasing core count using the die area savings.   Apple on the other hand seems to just use E-cores as a LP island, at least on the higher end skus, while not relying on it to boost nT perf/mm2. Hence why the higher core count skus cut back on e-cores and increase P-cores, while PTL is scaling up the number of e-cores. And also why Apple's 12 core mobile chip is 8+4, while PTL is 4+4+4. Or Apple's 16 core chip is 12+4, while PTL is 4+8+4.",Neutral
AMD,And their l2 cache sharing does haloe them in games some too,Neutral
AMD,"It depends on how hard you push the E-cores. Looking at Huang's power graph, a 265K E-core is more power efficient than a P-core in package power up to \~70% of the P-core's perf.",Neutral
AMD,"With perfect scheduling, they'll also improve efficiency for idle and light tasks that dont stress the cores much, and thus can run at much more power efficient clockspeeds, with lower power draw than P cores would do doing the same.  But I dont know how much this actually takes place in practice.",Positive
AMD,"We do have something pretty close with Zen 5C vs Skymont on N3E vs N3B respectively.   Zen 5C is *way* larger, even after attempting to account for the fact that Zen 5C has core private L2 while Skymont does not. It's still larger even if you literally remove the *entire* FPU block on top of that.",Neutral
AMD,How so?,Neutral
AMD,Intel didn’t support the same AVX extensions on their E cores for example.,Neutral
AMD,My work laptop literally never goes to LPE. Nothing is ever scheduled on them when I'm looking at task manager anyway.,Negative
AMD,They're removing cache ecc on consumer cores?,Neutral
AMD,"Kinda, yes. Intels approach is pretty complicated including the LPE cores themselves.",Neutral
AMD,In the ARM world there are tons of server chip designs that only use E cores to maximize multi threaded performance per Watt/Die Area. I believe Intel has a similar model either released or coming soon in their server lineup with the same idea - I don't keep that up to date with it though.,Neutral
AMD,"Check Sierra Forest, those are E-core only Xeon CPUs.",Neutral
AMD,I think there's new models even with more cores by now,Neutral
AMD,"Seems to me you could use a utility like Process Lasso to only allow programs to run on E-cores, to test that out.",Neutral
AMD,"Part of it is that AMD dense cores are afaik just full cores with less cache. This means for certain workloads they are 30% smaller, use a bit less power and work just as fast. That's why they go in servers. They also have x3d for stuff that benefits from more cache.",Neutral
AMD,Intels e cores are clustered like a CCX in AMDs designs. They're connected to each other well and use a high speed interconnect to communicate with other clusters. In intels design four e cores share one block of L3 cache. Communication within a cluster is much faster than leaving it.,Neutral
AMD,Exactly the same set of instructions are supported on intel p and e cores.  The p cores in early alder lake were technically capable of executing some extra instructions. Some motherboard manufacturers noticed this and made a special mode that allowed running P cores with more instructions than intended if E cores were completely disabled. But that was never supported nor intended by intel and it is no longer possible.,Neutral
AMD,"I would hazard a guess that when the compute die is active, it'll avoid scheduling to the LPE cores at all costs, but if a workload fits in the LPE cores alone (e.g. the system is idle and only performing background tasks) it'll use those",Neutral
AMD,Do you use windows in high performance mode?,Neutral
AMD,What's your processor? Meteor/Arrow/Lunar,Neutral
AMD,"Well, as u/bankkopf said, sierra forest, Intel's first generation e-core server CPU is already out.   Clearwater Forest, their second generation of this type of CPU, got pushed back to 1H 2026 (it was supposed to launch 2H 2025).",Neutral
AMD,"I would argue that the ultrasparc t1 cpu, that was used in sun fire t2000 was the first e-core only cpu - it had 32 threads on 8 cores (ok, 16-32 threads on 4 -8 cores) but ... just one fpu unit for all.",Neutral
AMD,"I think the comparison is a bit extreme tbh.   The E-cores just have a shared L2 which makes them special, but even that is not too uncommon when some ARM designs do that as well, and if rumors are right, so will the P-cores in NVL.   The penalty of leaving a 4 e-core cluster is also relatively good. [Interestingly enough](https://chipsandcheese.com/p/examining-intels-arrow-lake-at-the), core to core latency is worse going from a P-core to P-core, than going from an e-core cluster to another P-core.",Neutral
AMD,Lunar Lake also don't have a ringbus and use foveros,Neutral
AMD,You literally just described the P cores having a different instruction set and are contradicting yourself.  What do you think “P cores having extra instructions” means? Are you perhaps thinking I’m saying different ISA (which I’m not) ?,Neutral
AMD,Probably but also even at idle it doesn't happen. Though I read somewhere that's why new chips have 4 LPE because even at idle windows supposedly uses enough resources that 2 cores can't handle it. Which is possible but could also be horseshit. Wasn't exactly a verified source.    Either way I haven't seen it even if I turn off everything and let windows idle with just task manager.,Negative
AMD,I think it's on default but I'd need to check when I'm at work.,Neutral
AMD,"No, I did not.  Intel does not and never did support AVX-512 instructions on any of their heterogenous processors. Not in any form.   Internally CPUs can have all kinds of instructions and very likely many of them have hidden instructions for development or some future instruction set already implemented for testing purposes. What the CPU actually supports is what it advertises to software. Those are the instructions applications can use.   I repeat, intel does not support different instruction sets for P and E core in their heterogenous processors. There is no “pinning of applications to a cluster” or anything. I’m not even sure if any OS can even boot with differing instruction sets per core. And since intel noticed what motherboard makers were doing they have physically removed the availability of the wider avx instructions from the P cores.",Negative
AMD,"That is weird. My laptop with Ultra 5 125H does, which can be very noticeable because of the lag when transitioning from the machine sleeping to waking up. Sometimes it does that just from me leaving it idling for a while as well, so I will assume it is a BIOS / power mode thing.",Negative
AMD,"Your last sentence says: they removed the wider AVX instructions from the P cores.   So by your own admission, the P cores had AVX instructions that the E cores did not.   Which is literally what I said. What are you even arguing about then? That is exactly describing cores having different instruction sets.   And both windows and Linux can boot on mismatched instruction sets. If they couldn’t, where are all the reports of people not being able to boot before the (by your own description) the instruction sets were removed. As long as the OS doesn’t use them, there’s no issue booting.",Neutral
AMD,They are just being pedantic about the meaning of support.,Neutral
AMD,You are intentionally obtuse.   The cores do not have different instruction sets. I already ELI5d this to you.,Neutral
AMD,"AVX is an instruction set.   You said the P cores had AVX instructions that weren’t on the E cores.   Ergo the P cores and E cores had different instruction sets.   Literally, that is what your comments have said. And what my comments have said. If you have to resort to insulting folks instead of being able to make a coherent argument, that’s on you for failing to delineate whatever you think you’re trying to say.",Neutral
AMD,"They do. There was never official Intel support for it, but the physical actual cores were in fact supporting different sets of instructions.",Neutral
AMD,7800X3D,Neutral
AMD,"The 7800x3d is the better pick between those 2 cpus for mostly gaming, and can also handle those other tasks like streaming and multitasking no problem. The x3d v-cache is worth more than just $20, for that price difference its a bit of a no brainer.  For the parts you mentioned there really isn't any compatibility issues or bottleneck problems, the only thing I would say with AM5 is to make sure you get only 2 sticks of ram, Am5 can get unstable with 4 sticks and generally speaking you have to down-clock the ram speeds to get good stability.",Positive
AMD,"7800X3D  So long as you don't buy a really low end motherboard, you'll be fine. For memory, any 2x16gb 6000 CL30 kit would be ideal. 6000 CL36 is fine if 6000 CL30 is too expensive.",Positive
AMD,"If fast ram was cheap and you were into overclocking/productivity, you could make the case for the 9700x, but it looks like the X3D chip is the better option here",Neutral
AMD,7800x3d is up to 30% faster at gaming.,Neutral
AMD,The 9700X is only about 5% faster than 7700X  Meanwhile 7800X3D can show improvement of 15-30% over 7700X,Neutral
AMD,Straight to the point,Neutral
AMD,Thanks you told me what i need to know but still I find people who disagree idk why,Neutral
AMD,Yeha i will never like overlooking or ill turn the settings down or buy new parts,Negative
AMD,Yeha that's why im get the x3d,Neutral
AMD,"The main reason you would hear some people say the 9700x would be you aren't gaming but still do have heavy multicore workloads like video editing, 3d modeling, CAD software ect.   For mostly gaming use cases the reality is anyone who says the 9700x is better than the 7800x3d is just flat out wrong.",Negative
AMD,Yeha the x3d is the best bet for me,Positive
AMD,"The 9600XT will likely be a bottleneck for the 7800X3D in a fair amount of cases. But that is actually the *situation that you want.*  Proper attitude about bottlenecks isn't about removing them (because realistically, they can't be. At SOME point, you WILL have a bottleneck in the machine). It's about managing them. You want the bottleneck to be appropriately sized for your needs, and placed where you want it (i.e. the performance disparity between a 9060 XT 16GB and a 7800X3D on a 1080p display is reasonably small, and you want the graphics card to be the limitation when possible).  Oh and because you didn't specify, I would make sure that this is the 16GB version of the 9060 XT.",Neutral
AMD,"Its a decent combo, I think the 7800x3d is a bit overkill for the 9060xt personally, but if you are playing E-sport titles and plan on pulling 200-300 FPS it can be a good match.   Generally, I would say to go with the 9600x and a 5070/9070 that should net a better gaming experience overall.",Positive
AMD,Hot take: 9070xt & 7600x instead,Neutral
AMD,It won't,Neutral
AMD,What Hz monitor will you be playing on and what sort of games? Mainly competitive shooters or single player AAA titles?,Neutral
AMD,I am on a 9060XT and a Ryzen 5 9600X.  Has been about 3 or 4 weeks with the build now and no bottlenecking at the CPU.,Neutral
AMD,unless if u are into some competitive game u have too much cpu for ur gpu choice,Neutral
AMD,It's fine for 1080p and definitely won't bottleneck. Make sure you get the RX 9060 XT 16 gb for the best performance and future compatibility.,Positive
AMD,It's fine.  Yes you will have bottlenecks as it's impossible not to.  For most gaming the rx9060xt will be the bottleneck.,Neutral
AMD,"1080 p ?      it's sufficient but nowadays 1440p monitors are cheap. And the GPU is kinda weak for that cpu.    If i were u, i would buy a 1440p monitor and buy a 9070xt.",Neutral
AMD,7600 + 5070/9070 is just going to be way better.    Also bite the bullet and upgrade to a 1440p monitor. They're like $150-200 for a good 1440p 180hz IPS panel,Positive
AMD,the 7600x is more than good enough for your gpu choice,Positive
AMD,Drop down to a 9600X and up the GPU to a 9070 XT.,Neutral
AMD,I'm still enjoying my Ryzen 5800 XT and RX 6650 XT don't let the haters tell you its a bad rig.  That thing is a 1080p Ultra quality beast.,Negative
AMD,No not at all,Neutral
AMD,will what bottleneck?,Neutral
AMD,Exactly. Play the 9060xt until the wheels fall off of it. Then get a better GPU later on,Neutral
AMD,Youre mostly right if were talking cpu heavy games. But for more gpu demanding games the 7800x3d will probably not see much utilization.,Neutral
AMD,cool thanks! and yes i’m planning on getting 16GB,Positive
AMD,Not a hot take for sure,Neutral
AMD,the price jump from a 9060 to a 9070 is pretty insane for me so i might have to stick with 9060 as i am on a budget. will the 7600x work well with a 9060?,Neutral
AMD,Actually less FPS in many e-sport games with this combo.,Neutral
AMD,what Hz would you recommend? the monitor i’m thinking of buying is 180hz but I’m not sure if that will be enough,Neutral
AMD,what kind of games do you play?,Neutral
AMD,"Stick with the 7800X3D, a lot of games profit from it and depending on which games you play some are very heavy on the CPU, for me thats the case with Star Citizen.",Neutral
AMD,What's the price difference between a 7500f & 9070(non XT) Vs your original combo?,Neutral
AMD,"Well, that’s only a problem if you’re playing e-sports. If you’re playing more graphically demanding AAA titles, you’ll be benefiting.",Neutral
AMD,"I can see the difference between 144 Hz and 240 Hz, some people say they can’t see any difference beyond 144 Hz. It depends on you. 240 Hz is a good option, and they’re pretty cheap nowadays.",Neutral
AMD,okay cool i will look into getting 240 hz then thanks,Positive
AMD,"160-180hz is plenty imo. Go to an actual store like Best Buy and try out the monitors there for yourself to get an idea of the differences. I personally can’t tell the difference, but everyone is different.  What games will you be playing with this system?",Neutral
AMD,"What are the rest of the PC specs?  The 6500xt is a terrible card especially with lower PCIE slots.    Googling the 6500xt t5 legion model it has 8gb of RAM and a 5600g, which are all terrible components.  It needs at least 16gb of RAM to even play most games without being crashy and even then the best it's gonna handle is games like 8-10 years old at this point.",Negative
AMD,Is this a new problem or have you always had poor performance with this PC?,Negative
AMD,"While your system is pretty low end/weak, game performance will depend on the resolution and quality settings, and it should be able to play an 8 year old game like RDR2 at 1080p especially.  What resolution and quality settings are you playing the game at?  Are you sure the monitor is plugged directly into your GPU and not into the motherboard video port?",Neutral
AMD,Can you run Speccy and copy/paste the output here?,Neutral
AMD,"Unless you have a significant CPU bottleneck, you should be able to get around 90 fps at 1080p in rdr2 with a 6500 XT, so slightly higher FPS at your resolution. You CPU being limited to PCIE 3.0 and your GPU only using x4 pcie lanes will likely reduce performance noticeably though.

AMD,"Thank you so much for the quick reply! As I mentioned I'm super new to anything in this manner and while I've heard my graphics card is extremely poor, I actually don't even know how to/what to look for in terms of PC specs. Idk what a PCIE slot is, I feel embarrassed lmaoo",Negative
AMD,I think it might also be worth noting that I added more RAM to the PC so it now has 32gb. Idk if that helps.,Neutral
AMD,"Sorry for the late reply, it's been like this since I bought it in 2023.",Neutral
AMD,Right now it's set to 1760 x 990 with quality set to medium.   Also how would I check to see if my monitor is plugged into my GPU? I feel so dumb for not knowing this,Negative
AMD,"Understood, I'll give this a try. Thank you so much!",Positive
AMD,After running benchmark tests on RDR2 I don't believe it's indicating a CPU bottleneck.,Neutral
AMD,"It'd help somewhat but it depends on how you added it.  if it's one whole 2x16gb kit that's fine, if it's an extra 3 8gb sticks then that would be problematic.",Neutral
AMD,That tells me it's just kind of a slow PC.,Negative
AMD,"The GPU ports are lower down on the back of the pc in one of the horizontal slots. Your GPU is the graphics card, the big component installed lower down in the motherboard. The monitor video cable should be plugged directly into it through the back of your case.",Neutral
AMD,"Oh lordy, I did 4 8gb sticks and I didn't even know that would be problematic.",Neutral
AMD,When I bought it each box had two sticks.,Neutral
AMD,"Gotcha, is there anything specifically I should upgrade? If so what would you recommend?",Neutral
AMD,My monitor is connected to my PC via HDMI cable. Does that change anything?,Neutral
AMD,"Depends on your budget. But, the whole thing is kind of slow. It's not like there's one part you could upgrade to dramatically increase your performance.",Negative
AMD,"No, it doesn't help. Take a picture of the back of your PC, post it to imgur, and link it here.",Negative
AMD,I understand. Do you know roughly what parts you would upgrade if I had a budget of around $300-$400?,Neutral
AMD,Bet I got u right here: https://imgur.com/a/E6XTduv,Neutral
AMD,"At that budget, I would recommend upgrading your GPU to the Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB (not the 8GB model). If you decided to upgrade the rest of your PC later you could bring the new GPU over with it.",Neutral
AMD,"Well, the monitor is plugged in to the right place at least.",Neutral

AMD,Average air coolers are on par with average AIO's  Nowadays just comes down to what you want for your build aesthetically.,Neutral
AMD,"Fine as in “not thermal throttle”? If that’s the expectation most reputable brand’s dual tower air cooler will do.   However, AIO, especially 280/360, have significant advantages when it comes to noise to performance under sustained heavy load. If you don’t mind your PC sounds like a jetliner taking off, or you wear headphones anyway, you typically don’t need AIO.  But some of the thermalright 360 AIO are surprisingly price competitive even up against their own air cooler, can’t speak for its longevity but performance wise they are definitely worth considering.  Just avoid 120 AIO as they sometimes perform worse than air cooler, unless you are building a SFF build and short of space for air cooler.",Neutral
AMD,I switched from AIO to air cooling and got better temps on my 9800X3D by about 10°C. Very much can handle high end CPUs.    I had a Corsair 280mm Titan AIO and moving into new home with poor AC in the office caused hotter room ambient temps which resulted in higher CPU temps. I looked into and after some research landed on a ThermalRight Phantom Spirit EVO 120mm air cooler and plugged it in and immediately saw about 4°C cooler. After some fan curves adjustments I got it down to as much as 10°C than what I could get my AIO.    Noise is nearly the same with the new fan curves as my AIO was which is basically silent even under full load and only real difference I noticed was my AIO would regulate temps as it got hotter or cooler but took longer to cool down whereas the air cooler has more temp spikes but cools a lot faster.,Positive

AMD,"I have an old gtx660ti 2 pipe heatsink and as an experiment I decided to hold a dual jet lighter against it (you know them lighters which make nice blue cones of flame).  The water from the combustion in the flames condenses onto the heat spreader about 5mm away from the edge of the flames. No amount of time holding them flames to the surface will cause the water to evaporate off again.  I can immediately take the flame off and put my hand to the point I'd been trying to heat for minutes and it does feel like it's warmer than air temperature but it's by no means ""warm"".   And that's without any fans on the heatsink.  Air coolers are just evaporation coolers really.  What matters is keep the air in your case cool. Which is why I have a positive pressure fine nylon mesh filtered 4 in, 1 out (to encourage exhaust out of the case on the peerless assassin 120 I use) mesh case. Dust finds it hard to get in, and it's easy to blow out, all the extra fans intaking make sure the case is always at room temperature and the exhaust encourages the airflow to go through the cooler even without the CPU fans.",Neutral

AMD,"Yeah, 9800x3d in particular is a chip that can run pretty hot. I have a good thermal setup (good case, good fans, good location for the case, cold country etc.) and whenever I run a stress test and run all cores at 100%, the cooler does really well, but I always see the temperature go up to around 84 degrees and sloooowly keep climbing until it throttles itself.  If you expect offline video encoding to rival a heavy stess test, maybe get a good watercooler. If not, it should do fine.",Positive

AMD,"Yeah, 7800X3Ds were extra efficient because they kinda had to be, since the thermal path from cores through the cache chips to get to the heat spreader and eventually the heatsink wasn't great, therefore had to run somewhat conservative clock speeds and voltages compared to the non-X3D 7xxx models (and was also locked so you couldn't even attempt overclocking). 9xxxX3D has better thermal contact from cores through to heatsink so can run higher speeds and therfore worse out of the box efficiency with the higher power, but it can get more performance out of it.",Neutral

AMD,Gaming 9800x3D is the champion. Any kind of cpu intensive rendering or processing. 9950x3D outperforms. At least from all the reading and reviews I did before I bought the 9800,Neutral
AMD,9950x3d would be completely wasted on you   9800x3d,Neutral
AMD,"Don't pick the 9950x3d, I got one, and it's terrible,  The core parking bugs out constantly, I spent 2 months trying to find out what's wrong with my pc,  Only to find out it's the cpu, You need to do the strangest fixes to make it work,  And to top it off, It turns itself into a 9800x3d when you game,  So, there is no performance boost by having a 9950x3d,  And people say that procces lasso will change that buts not working for many people Inc me,  So please don't buy it, you will have issues",Negative
AMD,"If all you do is game, you choose the cpu that's better value for gaming, lol. Which is the 9800x3d, what are you confused about",Neutral
AMD,"I went through this same dilemma. If you are going to do any video, photo editing and such then go with 9950X3D, but if you are only gaming go with 9800X3D. I went with the 980p and am really happy.",Positive
AMD,"Can we ban this question, it’s asked every single day",Neutral
AMD,If its primarily for gaming go with the 9800x3d. You dont gain anything gaming wise from the 9950x3d and it costs significantly more so you would be paying for pretty much nothing.,Negative
AMD,Would the 9950 work better if you have an ultra wide up with a game in the middle and chrome windows open on both sides of the game window? Wondering if the extra cores would take on that load.,Neutral
AMD,"I started streaming with a 3800x cpu. 8c/16t. Discord open, OBS cpu encoding, chrome open, gaming and all that. Background tasks take up less than 1 thread.   I had a 7950x3d and went up to a 9800x3d. Still an amazing streaming and gaming setup.   The 9950x3d boosts like 200mhz higher than the 9800x3d but it can be complicated with so many cores and some apps and games not choosing the right ones. I had the threat scheduling program I cant think of the name, but the 9800x3d has none of those issues and is much cheaper and basically the same performance.   So theres no real worry you'll run out of threads on it especially when you take streaming out of it.",Positive
AMD,"If price isn't a factor then The question is can you use those extra eight cores, if you can't then might as well save some money if you can then get the 9950 X3D as it will perform about the same in gaming plus or minus a few percent as it is the same architecture.",Neutral

AMD,"They are exactly the same for gaming, so 9800X3D is the answer. The 9950X3D makes sense if you do other things than gaming that actually benefit from such a powerful 16 core CPU. For gaming it would be a waste of money.",Neutral
AMD,"9800x3d: less heat, easier to cool.   9950x3d: the feel of having the best cpu for am5 (until the next am5 cpu comes along)  Most games do not load my 9950x3d for more than 10-20%. But there are exceptions. You will see the benefit of 9950x3d only in some games.

AMD,9800x3d,Neutral
AMD,"If money is not problem, what about some time?  Wait for January and get the 9850X3D - 400mhz more plus likely another 200 OC.  They are effectively the golden silicon samples of the 9800X3D that can clock higher",Neutral
AMD,"As others have said, 9800X3D is for gaming and will perform on par with the 9950X3D with a less substantial price value.

AMD,"Unlikely to make any difference, apart from maybe a few % so not worth it.",Negative
AMD,"not at all.   9950X3D is a 16 core CPU.   Most games use only 4-6 cores. Very few use 8 cores, and only a literal handful could even manage to use more than that - if that was the case, then you'd already know if you needed a 9950.   Running 2 browser instances doesnt even register as a blip for even 1 core to be fully utilized.   Running an ultrawide display, is more about GPU capabilities than CPU. And with the way you're saying you want to use it as.... its never going to matter.",Negative
AMD,Should really make no meaningful difference since you'll almost certainly use the GPU (eg. NVENC) for encoding so the CPU barely has to do anything in relation to streaming.,Neutral
AMD,"You shouldnt be using the CPU to render/encode your streams - is slow an inefficient.   GPUs have their own dedicated encoder that takes frames from the frame buffer that have already been rendered.   Most streamers, the ones that are actually gaming... are still streaming and gaming from their 1 PC and it does it very well with using the GPU to do the work.   Its fast, highly efficient, and unless the streaming platform you're streaming on even allows you to have a bitrate thats in the 10,000-12,000+ to run higher resolutions where the bitrate would actually matter.... CPU rendering is useless. The only streamers that even have such bitrates available to stream at, at the ones who are pulling in tens thousands of viewers each stream, whom are on a consistent schedule that justifies the platform in unlocking that ability. And even most of those aren't game streamers, they're talking heads with a mostly static image coming from their $800+ DSLR face cam.   The average streamer, even if you run a podcast that has 1-5k viewers every stream... are usually locked to 6000 and below. I think on Twitch you're limited to a bitrate of 3500 and only until you meet certain thresholds will they even allow you to hit 6000.    The only time anyone should be using their CPU to encode for streaming, is when you're running a dual-PC streaming setup so that 1 PC runs the stream, alerts, overlays and transitions, recording and transcoding - so that the gaming PC's resources are not taking away from the performance of the gaming PC. And even then in a dual-PC setup - its just better to be letting the GPU on the Stream PC to be doing all that work.",Neutral
AMD,"Hmmm, let's  think.  The Ultra 9 is on a platform that has no future, it's ""dead"", there is no opportunity to drop in the next gen Intel cpu.  The Ultra trails both your current cpu in many games and it trails many of the AMD cpu's.   The Ultra is obliterated by the AMD x3d chips.    The one advantage the Ultra has is in productivity apps.  The 9950x3d goes toe to toe with the Ultra 9 in productivity apps:  a little faster in some, a little slower in others.  The Ultra cannot compare with the 9950x3d in gaming.  The vcache side of 9950x3d is actually a 9800x3d. The 9950x3d also obliterates the Ultra in gaming, because, well it is a 9800x3d when gaming.  Both the 9950x3d and the 9800x3d are on the AM5 platform.  AMD will run its next generation of cpu's, Zen6, on the AM5 platform.  Reliable sources report that Zen7 will also be AM5.  If you go with a chip setting on the AM5 platform (e.g. 9950x3d), you have the opportunity to simply drop in a Zen6 then a Zen7 cpu and have a modern and relevant machine for another 5+ years.  Intel only dreams of this!  The price delta between the 9950x3d and the 9800x3d is about $200.  If you have any doubts, get the 9950x3d.   Better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.    I was considering a 9800x3d vs a 9950x3d, I went with the 9950x3d.   Precisely because I want to know I have the flexibility to do more than game.  From a price to performance ratio for gaming, the 9800x3d is the winner.  If spending an extra $200 for the best, the fastest consumer cpu on the market , is woth the peace of mind?  No brainer,  go with the 9950x3d!",Negative
AMD,"If you want a cpu for 99% gaming, then get the best cpu for gaming which would be the 9800x3d. I was in the same boat as you last year when I switched to AMD. I was always an Intel person.

AMD,Ultra 9 is slower than the i9-13900KF in gaming.,Negative
AMD,"Nope. I've always been Intel, but I'm switching over to AMD when I get my next paycheck.",Neutral
AMD,"There is nothing in your use case that would make the Ultra 9 a better choice than the 9800x3d. Same for the 9950x3d, the 9800x3d is the clear best choice and the second best choice would 7800x3d",Positive
AMD,Its a dead socket.   So no upgrade path when Intel releases their next-gen CPU and Socket. You'd be forced to also replace the motherboard if you go with Intel. At least you can keep the same RAM sticks.,Negative

AMD,"Do these things in the background include multiple overlays for IRacing, music, and other software for numerous peripherals like pedals, wheelsbases etc?",Neutral
AMD,"I'd keep fiddling with it over getting a new CPU unless you really don't care about the money.   If you're going to switch to an 8-core CPU anyway, why not try dropping your 13900 to 8 P-cores, no hyper threading, and a bit of an undervolt. Your cooler is also relevant here but I'm assuming you have something decent?  I made the same changes to my 13700 and a client's 14900 and it's much better now.",Neutral
AMD,"Sounds like your CPU may have been degraded enough if you're having issues with it. 13 and 14th gen CPUs have 2 different issues - 1 is Intel letting motherboard manufacturers pump so much voltage to the CPU to run higher clockspeeds that they degrade really fast. So there were many BIOS updates to correct it, and also add the ""Enforce Intel Limits"" option to actually keep these CPUs operating how they were actually designed. The other problem was manufacturing defect - something about corrosion within the die so you'd have a permanently gimped CPU that no amount of undervolting and capping clockspeeds would ever help.   Might be time to RMA the CPU and get a fresh one from Intel - if yours is still within the warranty period. I would try this option first before trying to replace the entire platform. A brand new fresh CPU for free.... or spending $600-700 for a 9800X3D?  Like any corporation, they'll want to try to deny your claim, but if you pushback they're likely to replace that CPU.",Negative
AMD,"With the 4090 and some background apps, the 9950x3d might actually be worth the money if you don't care about the increased cost.     I hear you might need to manually assign the 3d cores to games though for maximum efficiency though, and I don't think it'll be any better in a meaningful way outside of not overdoing the load on your CPU with background using up assets",Neutral
AMD,"Used to run the same, except a 14900k, plagued with issues and had 2 degraded CPU's replaced with warranty in the span of 7 months, until I had enough and switched to an AMD R9 9950X, smooth sailing since.  Fuck Intel, CPU crashed mid windows update, corrupted everything",Negative
AMD,"Nope, it's roughly the same performance as the 9800x3d in games. The main issue is that the 9950x3d is way more expensive so there's no point spending that much money for bonus productivity that will not be used.",Negative
AMD,"No.   They perform identical in games.   If you're just using your PC primarily for gaming, there is absolutely no reason why you'd need a 16-core/32-thread CPU that doesnt game any better than the 8-core/16-thread 9800X3D.   There's also a nearly $200 price difference between them.   9800X3D retails for $459.   9950X3D retails for $649.    Again, just for gaming.... you really want to spend almost $200 more for a CPU that performs the exact same?  That extra $200 could get you into a whole new tier of GPU. It can mean the difference between a 5070Ti and a 5080. Or a 5070 and 5070Ti.",Neutral

AMD,"Yep, I have tried everything,  I got it working in the end,  But it took me months, and im not bad with pc's too, It's 100% software issues  They just built the software in a retarded way, Its working though windows systems and Xbox game bar + mode  And if gamebar bugs out you need to change registry settings to fix it,  Widows bugs out regularly, changes constantly, Its just waiting for failure at this point,  I wish we had more control over when core parking would activate directly from amd software So windows won't screw with it",Negative
AMD,"Thats great, but have you checked the core parking in several games?",Positive
AMD,"I am really thankful that you want to help me out, But i luckily got it working in the end,  Reinstalling windows was a routine in my 2 months of trouble shooting,  I lived inside bios,  Ripped out components, Replaced all cables, keyboard , mouse, and monitor   Windows 24h2 and 25h2 with and without updates, Stock windows and custom debloated versions,  Tried every single driver from motherboard,  windows, and directly from the manufacturers,  Every single hack, tweak, and fixes found on YouTube, forums, and reddit,  In the end, it was a combination of faults in the bios, Windows being windows, 2 drivers that secretly wouldn't install, and the software AMD itself that's only  fixed by registry settings,  And after all that, it's sometimes still buggy only to be fixed by a pc restart  Luckily,the last one won't happen very often ...so far",Positive
AMD,"The driver works to tell the OS to park the cores unless they're actually needed.  You can easily see this behavior using either task manager or AMD Ryzen Master if you have a second monitor to display it on your while gaming.  The OS will unpark them and allow other processes to use them if they need it, but it tries to keep them idle if possible.",Neutral
AMD,"It’s an 8 core CPU. The 13900 is 8 Performance cores + 16 efficiency cores. It has 32 threads vs the 16 threads on the 9800x3d  Sure the 9800x3d will get a fps boost from the 3d cache when gaming but outside of gaming the 13900k is faster per core and overall. Just look at single threaded and multi threaded core each r23 tests that put the cpus to the test. For multi threaded the 13900k scores in the 38,000 range and 9800x3d scores around 23,000    For single core it’s 2100 for the 9800x3d and 2300 for the 13900k  So technically the 13900k is a faster more capable chip due to having more cores and a good single threaded performance. The only place the 9800x3d will be an improved is in gaming fps thanks to the 3d cache. This is fine if all you do is game and want higher FPS but beyond that, it’s a slower chip in every other way than the 13900k.  The 9950x3d is faster than the 13900k in every way, not just gaming FPS. I’d go that route if it’s in your budget (and I did from a 13900k). It’s a far better chip.   https://en.overclocking.com/test-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d/",Neutral
AMD,Yeah multiple midi inputs/controllers while doing a collab in the background over discord. Plus trying to make edits as fast as possible in ableton with all those things going on I'll catch a lot of stutter I dont want anymore. Plus it should handle my version of premire pro like a champ.

AMD,"""some background apps"" amount to very little justification for having a 16core cpu. I think people overestimate what ""multitasking"" really means and think that you can only run a handful of apps before needing a CPU upgrade. RAM matters more to multi-tasking than CPU cores do - unless you actually use your PC to earn a living with - in which case, in a professional setting - yes, the 9950X3D is the BARE MINIMUM you'll want to use.   As a PC used 99% for gaming? No.   I have a 9800X3D and use my PC almost exclusively for gaming - occasionally i'll render or re-encode a video or two but im not running a game at the same time - I like being able to utilize my GPU at full-tilt of around 150fps when I'm re-encoding an 80GB 4K movie down to 10GB so I can watch some movies while I travel. I run multiple browser tabs, discord, a torrent client and sometimes Jellyfin.  The only other stuff running in the background is the typical list of windows processes that everyone has running.   Discord and my browser are chillin on my 2nd monitor and they're basically idle while Im gaming on BF6 or playing Expedition 33. Maybe I have a podcast playing... but that doesnt even fully utilize 1 core.   Unless OP is running a VM or two and/or is actually multi-tasking by letting a video or blender rendering, or some CFD program... a 9950X3D is not going to benefit him at all.  OP's use-case is similar to mine. PC mostly used for gaming with only a handful of typical programs running in conjunction with the primary focus being on a game.  The adage of ""unused RAM is wasted RAM"" would fit perfectly if you swapped ""RAM"" with ""cores"". Unused cores is wasted cores. If OP is only going to be using no more than 6-8 cores... the extra 8 cores are just going to be sitting idle barely registering as a blip.   Its also nearly $200 more expensive.",Neutral
AMD,I'm waiting for 9600x3d,Neutral
AMD,"I am not sure about that. It may cost close to $1000 and it probably only benefit very selected games that needs more compute than 8 cores can offer. In addition, there will still be a lot of context switching costs between the 2 CCDs.  That being said, I found myself to be a potential beneficiary of Ryzen 9 because I like keeping multiple low demand gacha games idling in the background (so I do not need to keep relaunching them). Although these games are both low demand and idling, they typically still fully occupy at least 1 cpu core",Neutral
AMD,"-update Bios and chipset drivers  -windows power settings - balanced   -Update gamebar and make sure it recognizes your game when you launch   To verify, You can pull up resource monitor, then go to gamebar settings and select “recognize this as a game” then when you close and relaunch the program the cpu tab will show half the cores parked.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm well aware of that, but OP stated they will use it 99% for gaming so they should really pick a CPU that does best what they do 99% of the time. That's why I would consider the 9800X3D to be an upgrade. If they did 50/50 gaming and productivity you could definitely argue differently.  I do gaming and quite a bit of other stuff that can benefit from a lot of cores so I would personally get the 9950X3D if I were to upgrade now.",Positive
AMD,"Well the 13900 is a very hot chip so unless you have a 360mm AIO, you're going to have issues running it at full capacity. That's why limiting the cores helps. It's reducing the heat generation so the chip doesn't throttle.  Regardless, if you just feel like replacing the CPU, board, and ram is easier, no worries!",Neutral
AMD,"I suppose fair enough, but the 4090 is full on top tier GPU of its generation and if anything will ever bottleneck a 3d chip at max settings, its one if the two most likely    Also seems like it'll fetch a better resale value if they ever want to upgrade in the far future since it'll be able to handle rendering, and easier to hold if they want to maintain top tier performance keeping it far into the future. $200 is also ram miney right now",Positive
AMD,Read my post closer.,Neutral

AMD,At anything less than 53 cores I crash to bios in the middle of a game. Anything more and it runs but not for long.,Negative
AMD,"Meaningless because 9800X3D edges out the 9950X3D by slim margins, they typically trade blows even if the 9950 has a slightly higher clock speed on the cache CCD.   Typically good performing CPUs always hold their value much better: Look at the used prices of 5700X3D & 5800X3D - they're hitting over $300 and brand new stock that still exists is spiking due to high demand and no more production.   Its kind of a moot point when you're looking at it from a purely financial incentive.",Neutral
AMD,I guess I replied to the wrong person,Neutral
AMD,For sure I feel you. I didn’t see that you had fixed it. This CPU should come with a guide or something so no one misses one of these important steps. I was surprised I had to seek the information out through other sources,Negative
AMD,"Sorry, 53 cores?  Regardless, it sounds more like you have a bad part rather than a situation where you need an upgrade.  If you have your bios up to date and set to Intel default limits, you can set P-cores to 8, E-cores to 0, and disable hyper-threading.

AMD,"From what i understand the 9800x3d wins by having less latency between cores, hence why it performs better with a lower clock. Most games also don't utilize more than 8 cores, so the 9950x3d also doesn't typically have a way to take a lead and ever so slightly underperforms as the rest of them don't get usage in game even if you make sure all 3d are utilized    The difference is also small, though, and if you ever want to upgrade you'll have a wider market to sell too as a gamer won't think twice about a 9950x3d over a 9800x3d, and animators/researchers would also probably be happy with a older model.     I'm not going fo say I didn't have doubts or I think i know better than you, but why worry about an extra $200 with a GPU that you couldn't catch for less than 1.5k if it let's you handle everything the more competitive model can, then heavier more professional loads today with potential to help later if theres ever a bottleneck?",Neutral

AMD,"Because why should OP spend $200 more money for a CPU that will go under utilized, when the 9800X3D will suit his use case? Especially when he said 99% of the time the pc will be used for gaming...  You're going into this under the impression that PC hardware is somehow an investment... like a car, its a depreciating asset. It MIGHT hold more value, for a bit longer. But nobody buys hardware thinking how much money they are going to get back when they sell the hardware later. Or.... in the chance that MAYBE OP's use-case might change... which it would just be easier to upgrade to the latest and greatest at whatever time in the future that he needs something that suits his needs better.   Like I said elsewhere, that $200 can be spent elsewhere thats more meaningful... like going with a higher tier GPU, or more storage space. Or not spending it at all.",Neutral

AMD,"A CPU may work harder in first boot.  I would install your OS and start monitoring your CPU temps and go from there.  There might be a problem like sticker on cooler was not removed, cooler is not tightened enough, thermal paste got smeared to the side of the cpu when installing cooler or cooler fans blowing in the wrong direction.  But if you live some place hot and the room you have the PC in is hot, then yours CPU temps are going to be hotter then someone with a cold room.",Neutral

AMD,"These parts are very solid and I think that you'll be very happy with the performance! Especially if you plan on everyday computing with some light gaming/production work.  The only recommendation I would make is to add an aftermarket cooler that performs better than the stock cooler. Nothing wrong with the stock cooler though. I have the stock cooler of a 3900X on my Plex server and it definitely gets the job done with no concern! :)  If you would like to consider an aftermarket cooler, the [Thermalright Peerless Assassin](https://www.amazon.com/Thermalright-Peerless-Assassin-120-Cooler/dp/B09LGY38L4?th=1) has incredible performance at a great price.  Regarding your fan question, that's ultimately up to you. Some people want maximum airflow, some people can't stand the noise that can come with a tower full of fans spinning, some people don't care either way. But yeah, I would recommend 2 fans in the front for intake and one for exhaust. Which I guess is the default configuration. It's a solid little case, but fan options are real limited.",Positive

AMD,"Depends on how much money you're willing to spend! In 2025, you'll see plenty of happy people still on their AM4 machines, with the two processors you named (5700/5800X3D) often at the heart of it.   I noticed for your use case that you find yourself not gaming as much as you are running a VM and coding. For that, you'll want to consider an 8 or 16 core processor like the [Ryzen 7 5700X](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09VCHQHZ6) for $169 or [Ryzen 9 5900XT](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0D6NMCZG1) for $284. The X3D chips cannot be bought new as of now as far as I can tell, but for your use case, you should be fine with the non-X3D chips.  You would probably need to update the BIOS of your motherboard to support 5000-series chips. Your 2700X has the same TDP as the 5900XT (105W), so you should be fine with either chip.  If you have more money to shell out, AMD has stated that they would support and release chips for the AM5 platform through 2027. A [Ryzen 7 9700X](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0D6NMDNNX) would run you around $300, plus you would need to get a new motherboard and RAM, which would cost probably around $450-500, depending on parts.",Positive

But given it's the 2nd fastest CPU on am4's longlived life, the price of it has gone up a lot. People don't want to spend $450 on upgrading to am5.

You‘re not getting an AM5 system for the price of a 5700x3d.  The cheapest solid system I can get in Germany is running me at 420€ (w/o shipping and more importantly w/o cpu cooler) and that System only has a 7500f. 7600x would be +40€ and 7600x3d would be +145€. Because my system is still running fine, inchoate to wait until I can get a good deal on a used 5X00x3d cpu on eBay or somewhere else.   As to your question: is it overpriced? Absolutely. Ist it worth it? Depends on how much you would gain (you didn’t write what your upgrading FROM) and if you could spend more on an upgrade?

AMD,It would be better to save another $100 on top of this cost and upgrade to AM5. You can get a cpu + mobo for that price. The extra hundred is because of the cost of ddr5 ram at the moment.

AMD,This is the way! 7600x performs very similar to 5800x3d.  5700x3d makes zero sense at that price. Get decent b650 board for 120-150 and 7600x cpu. Ram is extra but you will be future cpu upgrade ready if/when needed.,Neutral
AMD,"I have MSI B450-A Pro Max (7B86-022R) and 32 GB DDR4 Ram and 5060 ti. The problem is I’m a complete PC noob, I don’t trust my self that I can change my motherboard alone.",Negative
AMD,"Both 5800 X3D and 5700 X3D have been absurdly expensive since release with the exception of a few flash sales in my country. Everyone wants to milk the last performance they can from their AM4 platforms.  I just bought a 5800 X3D for 3000 SEK (\~315 USD), after hunting for one for quite some time, they usually go for 3500 SEK or so. I wouldnt have done it if I didn't want to play BF6 with decent FPS and on top of that I got a high-end AM4 motherboard (X570 MSI MEG ACE) with high performing DD4 ram, so I got the opportunity to milk every last frame from my AM4 platform.",Neutral
AMD,my 5800x3d just died.... looked at the priceses and was like hell no im going am5 plus my 4090 needs a bit more cpu power...  (I was really hoping to upgrade my living room cpu to it :( ),Negative
AMD,"Changing all my parts is too expensive lol, I haven’t been in the pc space for a while but damn ram alone is double what it used to be.",Negative
AMD,Forgot to add: an 5800xt might a great option. Still can be had new from vendors for about 170€ 👍,Positive

AMD,Switching MB is not hard. Watch some youtube videos. You need proper Philips (?) screw driver and two hands.,Neutral
AMD,Which CPU do you currently have?,Neutral
AMD,"With YouTube, there are literally *thousands* of videos that'll show you how to do it step-by-step. It's really not difficult. Just take your time.   Spending real money on an AM4 platform if you don't need to is a waste of money.",Negative
AMD,everyone's a noob at the start. Trust me it's not hard,Negative
AMD,"Swapping the CPU is the ""hardest"" part when changing mainboard + CPU + RAM. If you would do that anyways on AM4, you should be able to change a motherboard with the help of a video guide",Neutral
AMD,"Dunno about europe, but the 5700x3d were $180-200 for months in mid 2024. $180 was an amazing deal and people were idiots to ""save"" like $40-60 and go for a 5700x/5800x instead but in their mind it was still ""30% higher cost for only 10% performance"". Stupid way to evaluate CPUs, based on % price difference versus gaming performance.",Negative
AMD,"300€ is too expensive anyway, don't feed the scalpers. If you are adamant on staying on am4, you might get a 5800 x or xt instead.",Negative
AMD,"I guess it depends where you are. Took a look at newegg and amazon, an AM5 build with an entry level board is $365 with 32gb 6000 c30.  Depending on what you're replacing, say, 5600 + B450 + 32gb ddr4 should at least sell for $230, so you're spending $135 for the upgrade.  A 5700x3d is 240-260, minus 80-100 by selling the 5600, $160 for the upgrade.",Neutral
AMD,Same as me. I‘m still happy with my 5600x but I will upgrade to a 5700 or 5800x3d if I find one around the 250€ mark. Don’t know how long it will take but unless ddr5 starts to drop or the b850 boards come down in price an AM5 upgrade will be double the cost.,Neutral
AMD,"Does appear in CS2 that the 5700x3d is better. Though I think I’d still go the route of 7600x and trying to tweak it + memory timings, it’ll be close, and atleast you’re on a newer platform.",Neutral
AMD,"Some games yes, modern titles like BF6 performance is very close. Not that 9800x3d is close to 7600x but 5800x3d is close to 7600x. Older arch is not as great, cache helps but not in all games.  EDIT: here is some “proof”  https://www.techspot.com/review/3021-ryzen-5800x3d-cpu-gpu-scaling/  Only 4 games, but it paints a picture. Warhammer is cpu heavy game.",Neutral

AMD,"5 5600, in games like BF6 big CPU bottleneck",Neutral
AMD,"The cheapest I ever saw one was 2999 SEK new (315 USD once again), and that was from flash sales that sold out in hours. Granted that was when it was the best gaming CPU availble. Normal price was around 3999 SEK for most of the time.   But yeah, the used market for 5800 X3D have resulted in bidding wars everytime I saw one. AMD probably had a somewhat bad percentage of CPUs that actually passed the bar for being a 5800 X3D combined with a insane amount of people that had a good AM4 motherboard wanting to upgrade.  And maybe they fucked up the spread somewhat, trying to oversell in the US compared to Sweden. Since the shortage have been insane here.",Neutral
AMD,"I currently have a 5800x, my pcs pretty good for am4 if I want a significant improvement I’m gonna have to do a whole new build",Positive
AMD,For something like world of warcraft the 3d cache is upwards of 100 fps,Neutral
AMD,"BF6 is a game where AM5 offers a pretty big uplift.   If that is your main game, I'd save for AM5.",Positive
AMD,"It's very, very rarely worth buying a new chip with the same architecture.   Just go AM5 at this point and sell your board/ram/cpu as a bundle to someone",Negative
AMD,"not worth it from a 5600 at 290 euros. MAYBE if you had like a 5070 Ti and playing at 1080p/1440p, but the gains for some $300 GPU won't be worth it at all.",Negative

AMD,Yeah then don't change anything and save that money for a future am5 upgrade.,Neutral
AMD,For 290 euro though… way overpriced. 7800x3d just makes more sense for a bit more and selling the old parts.  If it was cheaper I would agree to just go that route.,Neutral

For tasks where you need high core counts Intel might still be the better choice, for gaming AMD is usually better overall and at set price points.    But it depends on your needs and budget",Neutral
AMD,x3d AMD baby,Neutral
AMD,"Largely, yes. There are still situations where an Intel unit is a better choice, but those are somewhat rare. If your intended usage is ""general use/gaming"" then yes - AMD is almost certain to be the better choice for your needs.   As to why, Intel basically has been on a case of the ""fuck-its"" for a WHILE now. They were making money hand-over-fist while Apple was using their units, and AMD didn't really have much with which to compete. So they would just do an almost yearly, ""here's our latest release. It's slightly better than the last release."" But they lost their edge for innovation, and didn't put enough time/money/effort into making sure that their fabs were cutting edge. Then Apple dropped them and they lost a HUGE customer. Shortly after (or maybe almost simultaneously), AMD released Ryzen which was their first legit competitor in quite a while. It still wasn't *quite* as good as Intel's best at the time, but it was getting better. And because AMD was fabless, they could use the latest fab technology and not have to implement it themselves. So while Intel was more-or-less stuck on their endless refinement of the 14nm process in 2021, AMD was releasing Ryzen 5000 on 7nm. Intel did somewhat come back with their 12th gen CPUs, but then stumbled again as their panic releases took them in continually bad areas. AMD then released their 3D V-cache series and then for gaming they basically left Intel in the dust.",Neutral
AMD,"There is practically no reason to go for Intel unless it is heavily discounted, or if you’re doing extremely heavy rendering/productivity.   AMD wins in basically every category right now though, and they lose in productivity/rendering by such a small margin, only the really maximalist professionals would pick Intel.  If you’re going for a gaming pc AMD clears. The X3D chipset is really impressive, but its price is also imposing. You will get a great experience with the AM5 chipset but X3D is definitely the go to if you can afford it in your budget.",Positive
AMD,"Yes, and you have a much longer windows of upgrades. Intels doesn't support their sockets as long as AMD.   But, avoid AsRock boards if you ever plan to put an X3D chip in it.",Neutral
AMD,"I think it really depends on the person. This will probably get me downvoted but for 90% of people if they are gaming and browing the web it does not matter to a large degree.   So a goto chip for most people is whatever you can afford and want to put into a machine. If you want to build a intel machine if you put in a decent intel cpu and decent gpu. You will still enjoy your games just fine.   Now if you are the gamer who has the frames clock going in the corner, and is dropping in a 5090 and researching the tightest ram timings, and getting the best of best nvme drives then sure get get get your amd 9800x3d or what have you and be happy.

AMD,"Doesnt really matter, for gaming it's all about the GPU. The CPU only comes into play when you play games that don't require pretty graphics but high fps like competitive shooters. AMDs X3D Chips are designed to handle over 250 fps, while Intel caps Out at 200-250 ish. However, if you play games at lower fps you again won't notice the difference.  My advice is always get the best deal. People these days tend to pay extra for 9800X3Ds and then only game on a 5060 TI which doesn't make any sense. Put 40% of your budget into the GPU. Then build the rest around it.",Neutral

I didn't but this chip to run games in 1080P.  I have heard zero reliability issues with the Ultra or negativity from anyone that actually owns one.

Yeah, their best parts will edge out a 9950X and 9900X and do it a little more cheaply, but Intel has an ungodly stink on their brand and their current socket is basically EOL. AM5 is going to be here at least through Zen 6, and Zen in general is only going from strength to strength.",Neutral
AMD,Price to performance theyre the way to go. Am4 socket chips are still decent and pretty cheap.,Positive
AMD,"Intel might appear to have better performance, but it's reliability is so poor with the chips it's made in the last few years, that it isn't worth it.",Negative
AMD,"AMD, in general, is just as good as intel for everything.  Their X3D CPUs are better for gaming than intel CPUs, but come at a premium.  The non-X3D CPUs are just on par.  That said, AMD's AM4 socket had a long life and AM5 will have at least one more generation of CPU before the switch to AM6.  Intel's current socket is done and will be replaced next year.  Most people recommend AM5 because of the potential to upgrade the CPU in the future is perceived to be higher.  If you are not someone who upgrades CPUs, it isn't really an issue.  Intel's core Ultra 2s are price/performance competitive (for the most part) with their AMD counterparts (excluding X3D for gaming).  Also, intel got a black eye with the way they handled the voltage spike degradation issue in the 13th and 14th gen K series CPU.  It isn't like AMD didn't have a somewhat similar issue with 7800X3Ds the year before (they did, but they addressed it a bit quicker and a bit more openly than intel did).  Also, on the upgrade front, recently there have been a few threads where people have asked about upgrading their AM4 CPUs and people are telling them to switch to AM5 for upgrade-ability, which kind of defeats the purpose of buying AM4 for upgrade-ability five or six years ago.  So, once AM6 comes out, the same people that are telling you to buy AM5 for ""upgrade-ability"" are going to tell you to just switch to AM6 when you ask them what AM5 CPU you should upgrade to 😉  My take is that if you are someone who has to have the latest and greatest and are likely to upgrade your CPU in the next year or two, go with AMD and AM5.  If all you do is gaming and you can afford the X3D premium price, go with AMD.  Otherwise, go with whatever you fancy.  By the time you upgrade, you'll be replacing the motherboard and memory (DDR6!) anyway.  Disclaimer: I have owned stock in Intel (I got out before the s#!t show started) in the past and currently own stock in AMD.  So I'd really prefer you to buy AMD.",Positive

AMD,"Setting aside any other functionality of the chip, because right now AMD is very competitive and in a lot of cases just better than Intel, let me give you the main reason why you should ONLY build your computer with AMD, and NEVER buy Intel if you can help it, with the ONLY exception being if someone is giving you an Intel motherboard and CPU for less than $100...   **Motherboards and CPUs are expensive.**  Even my used x870 and 7600X, on sale, cost me over $300: and you don't want to have to spend this kind of money every couple years just to upgrade the computer.   **Intel**, for at least a couple decades, has been doing anti-consumer crap where they purposefully make a new socket every couple years, forcing you to buy a new motherboard if you want to upgrade your CPU, with methods as absurd as arbitrarily changing the pin locations on their sockets so that even though the socket is functionally the same the two CPUs won't work in it.  There was even an absurd situation less than 10 years ago where you could upgrade your CPU by just using tape or bits of metal to arbitrarily cover or bridge connections to make the motherboard think it was a different CPU, because apparently they were cutting performance based on that.   **AMD**, meanwhile, just released another round of CPUs for the AM4 socket, which already held the record for the longest supported socket: everything from the ryzen 1000 series to the 5000 series works on that socket, meaning if you have a computer with a Ryzen 1500, you can upgrade it right now to a Ryzen 5950 X3D, assuming the power control supports that wattage.  Note that they came out with the AM5 socket a couple years ago, meaning ***AMD is still making new CPUs for a socket they aren't even pushing anymore.  Even the first AM4 socket computers can upgraded to support Windows 11 without buying a new Motherboard, CPU, and RAM.***  The AM5 socket is charted to be similar, with the 11000 and 13000 series slated for it.   Once again, **motherboards and CPUs are expensive.**  You don't want a CPU socket you can't upgrade.  Even if Ryzen processors weren't performing better than Intel processors, even if there was some known problem with them (like there is with Intel right now), if your motherboard has an AM5 socket, you could always go buy a newer one in a couple years.  Personally, I have a plan to replace this older Ryzen 5 with a 9800X3D or even a 11800X3D when the price gets dropped by newer CPUs coming out... And I won't have to replace the motherboard to do that, because I got a mid-range X870 with full PCIe5 support, meaning it was MADE to handle those CPUs to their full potential.   This is in contrast with my last few Intels I got on deals: the CPU no longer cuts it, and there's no option to upgrade, sometimes even within the *same generation.*  With my AMD?  No more problem.  If the CPU isn't cutting it (and it is, because the 7600X is excellent for the price point), I just go drop another couple hundred on a newer and better one.    This is just basic math: future me will be able to afford a newer CPU WAY sooner than a full-on motherboard, CPU, and potentially RAM.   Even if there's some reason to upgrade the motherboard, I can do that without buying a new CPU, because it's all the same socket.   **Side Note:**   I run Linux, which AMD has better support for in both CPUs and especially GPUs, so Fuck Nvidia, I'm recommending AMD for GPUs too.   **TLDR:** Don't make the mistake of boxing yourself in like I've done in the past, go with the company that is making sockets that last, and spend a little more on the motherboard now so you aren't buying a new one in a couple years.  YOU WILL SPEND LESS MONEY TO GET MORE.",Neutral

They had to be bailed out by Nvidia and the US government because things were looking that bleak for them.   And then for gaming AMD's 3D's CPU's just stomp whatever Intel comes up. Intel has yet come up with answer to it despite having almost 4 years to do so. AMD also uses way less power and has better upgrabilitiy. Sort of a no brainer to do.

AMD,AMD is dominating the market... there is pretty much no reason to go Intel these days... intel has become the budget option now lol  AMD has huge upgradeability especially with BIOS updates  If you bought first generation Ryzen and the mobo for it... you can easily upgraded to max Ryzen 7 5800x3D even which came out yeaaars later  But because of the BIOS being limited from what i understand you can either support 1000 to 3000 series Ryzen or 3000 series to 5000 series Ryzen because support of older CPU's got cut in the newer BIOS to make space for newer CPU's  So AMD is great for upgradeability without changing the mobo  And value is pretty nice aswell and you can get them super cheap especially on the used market  For example in my case... a used Ryzen 5 3600 costs like 40 euros but a used i7-8700 costs like 100 euros and i have an i3-8100 right now which means it's a better option to buy Ryzen 5 3600 and motherboard than it is to buy just an i7-8700 lol,Positive

So right now, just remember to update your BIOS and you shouldn't have a relevant performance difference between equivalent processors from Intel and AMD, so choose by which one has the best price to performance  And remember that LGA1700, the Intel equivalent for the AM5 socket supports both DDR4 and DDR5, so that's important if you're on a budget",Neutral

AMD,Ryzen was released way before Apple dropped Intel.  The ryzen 1600X - 1800X competed with the Intel 8600K - 8700K.  I got a 8700K because the first ryzen had mediocre single thread performance and while amd beat Intel in multithread that generation they weren't allround better.  I'm not sure exactly when apple dropped Intel but AFAIK there have been 10th or even 11th gen MacBook.  At that time Intel was (about to go) up against zen 3.  Zen 3 (the 5000 series) was where amd went from a good alternative to outright better in many situations.  They're still not better in all though. The 13900k that I'm running is a fine chip and it could certainly handle itself against amd when it came out.  For gaming the x3D chips are best but they only have 8 cores and are mediocre workstations. They're not all rounders in that sense.,Neutral

You also are picking parts totally wrong.  You are only bottlenecked if you choose to be bottlenecked. Graphical settings are adjustable but there's not really anything you can do on the CPU side if you are lacking performance. It is a hard ceiling.

AMD,"This is true to an extent, but needs more context. At the top end, Intel has more cores than AMD, but not all cores are created equal. Even back in 12th gen, Intel started using big.LITTLE, so you do sometimes get more cores, but it's a lot of small, single threaded cores that often don't clock higher than 4.5GHz. With the Core Ultras, Intel has now moved to single threaded cores across the board, so core count is even less equal to throughput. For example, the 285K has 24 cores, which *sounds* like more than the 16 of something like a 9950X. However, that's 24 cores with 24 threads instead of 16 cores with 32 threads. Also, only 8 of those 24 are performance cores that clock at 5.7GHz. The other 16 core max at 4.6GHz. Meanwhile, the 9950X is 5.7GHz across 32 threads. For anything that can actually make use of all the threads, the 9950X will *destroy* a 285K. The saving grace for Intel is that only happens with very specific workloads. In many cases, even 8 cores and/or 16 threads is more than enough for any productivity task. It's just important to realize that core count doesn't tell the whole story anymore.",Neutral

AMD,"Allegedly fixed them, we won't know how well that fix worked until we've seen (very) long time tests. They also lied multiple times about it being fixed.    Also if you used the CPU before the fix, it already permanently degraded, the microcode just keeps it from degrading further. This absolutely destroys resell ability, as you never know if the previous owner used the chip on an older BIOS before.    Then there is the issue of the CPUs (14700k and 14900k) being slower in games while using over 3x (!) the power...so no, the 14th gen won't perform just as well as AMD",Negative
AMD,Well let's see how the next generation will perform.,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, the difference in general isn't that bad across the board, and amd and intel are pretty much equal in budget range. it's just a combo of some really poor choices by intel and recent gen 14 CPUs frying themselves due to bad voltage specs sent to motherboard manufacturers that's hurt them hard. Sure the microcode bios/uefi updates fixed it but it was kinda too little too late. AMD had a similar issue with asrock motherboards and I think they handled it way better, you'd get a new CPU, no questions asked while I know 2 people who's intel gen 14 CPUs fried and they had to buy replacements on their own because the CPUs died after updates were out even though the damage to them was done before update and they just succumbed to damage few months later. Intel also tends to do things like swapping sockets a lot so getting an upgrade down the line might not be an option while AMD had/has way longer support for am4/am5 sockets.

AMD,"> Ryzen was released way before Apple dropped Intel.  Fair enough - my memory was such that it was around the same time. But it looks like Apple dumped Intel in 2020 and Ryzen came out in 2017. Still the point stands - Apple was a HUGE customer for Intel, and losing them meant that they had a lot less money to throw at R&D like they had done in the past (i.e. the last time AMD was kicking their ass, they supposedly spent more in R&D than AMD's entire market valuation and somewhat violently took the performance crown back from AMD with the Core2 series).   And I believe I covered that the initial Ryzen releases weren't as good as Intel's options at the time, but they were a VAST improvement over Bulldozer. The point I was making was that they could rapidly improve their designs because they could use other company's fabs and didn't have to deploy new process tech on their own, having spun off Glo-Fo years earlier.   > The 13900k that I'm running is a fine chip and it could certainly handle itself against amd when it came out.  Right. That's why I mentioned that Intel recovered somewhat with the 12th gen, the 13th gen would be included in that (if you somewhat ignore the degradation issue with Raptor Lake silicon). Their rapid slide, however, continued with the panic release of the 14th ""gen"", which was basically an overclock of the 13th gen silicon.   > For gaming the x3D chips are best but they only have 8 cores and are mediocre workstations. They're not all rounders in that sense.  ...Right. That would be why I mentioned that ""for gaming they basically left Intel in the dust."" And also why literally the second sentence I wrote in that initial comment was that ""there are still situations where an Intel unit is a better choice, but those are somewhat rare.""

I was on the fence about a PSU but decided, since my existing PSU has been running for years, it could approach end of life, and I don't want to run the risk of a failure and that bricking all the new kit!  Also, mobos only seem to have four SATA ports these days, so I actually had to retire one of my older, smaller SSDs as I literally can't plug it in any more. 😂  I assume you could pay for a more premium mobo with more but didn't want to splash the extra cash!  Good luck!  It's all still pretty much like expensive lego to fit together.  I just took my time and when I pushed the power button for the first time, it worked! 😍",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah i do.   CPU: AMD 9800X3D  GPU: Gigabyte 5070 ti Gaming OC 16GB  Motherboard: Asus TUF X870 WiFi  RAM: 32GB 6000MHz CL30 (cant remember what brand)   M.2 SSD: Samsung 990 Pro 2TB   AIO:  Phanteks 360 something. Went with that since I also got a Phanteks NV5 mk2 case and Phanteks case fans.   Also got an LG 2k 18pHz monitor since I needed something newer. Reusing on of my previous monitors as a secondary.   Obviously dont need the exact same stuff but there's an idea for ya. I'm in NZ so was a pretty substantial investment. If I wasn't in NZ id have probably considered getting a 3080 instead of the 3070ti, but here the performance bump wasn't worth the price bump.

It means there is an essential part of your PC slowing down another. In this case we are talking about the cpu bottlenecking the gpu. You don’t need the overpriced x3d to achieve this.

AMD,"I don't really get why it's so important for you to affirm all the things you got right. I wasn't trying to put you down or anything just pointing out the discrepancy between the ryzen release and the apple debacle.  Apple was a big customer but when Intel was dropped fully the M series of arm chips was already displacing them. It was still a huge blow for sure but it was never the real reason Intel ended up struggling. It was a symptom of the real problem and not the cause.  The real problem wasn't entirely complacency either even if they sure were milking consumers. The biggest issue was a combination of factors - mostly the natural monopoly emerging with tsmc while at the same time a short sighted but genuine sunken cost fallacy prevented Intel from going EUV.   I mean genuine as in, Intel was so much ahead that when they needed it EUV wasn't ready so they spent a metric ton of money maxing out multi patterning for the right reasons. EUV wasn't ready and they had to do something else in the meantime.   When EUV finally was ready, tsmc started buying EUV while Intel had enough (and at the time still competitive) production capacity with multi patterning. They were basically still making the money back on those investments.   The problem was when multi patterning hit the wall EUV was still accelerating and they were a mile behind at that front. They should've realized that they had to bite the bullit on it earlier, but this is hard when it's so expensive and your products still seem to be doing well.   I think it took way too long and I still think Pat Gelsinger essentially made all the right decisions, but just painfully late (though maybe still not too late).   The simplified story MBA's like to spin that you're a genius if you go fab-less in my view is bullshit because intel-foundry is a must survive strategic asset and it wasn't doomed from the start (and still isn't).   The mindset that all that matters is margins and short term shareholder value is how the entire world ends up dependent on Taiwan. It's painfully undesirable but indeed slightly more profitable per unit for all companies involved.   That also becomes a self fulfilling prophecy though. ASML machines become progressively tuned and better yielding as you pump out volume.   A monopoly has the highest volume so will end up with the best tuned machines and the best yields.   Given that engineers are massively cheaper and work longer hours in Taiwan and that tsmc receives strong government support in Taiwan, combined with the volume advantages makes it hard for them not to win.   Spinning of Intel-design as fabless leaves Intel foundry with less volume and you can't survive or thrive as a foundry that way.   The Chinese understand this hence the ban on using foreign silicon in the future.   Normally it's a bad move to force your companies to use inferior products but foundries are weird. The product is inferior with low volume because you don't get to tune the machines enough. If you do guarantee high volume you do get to tune the machines and your product won't be so inferior anymore.   This weird dynamic (and the fact that you need to sell your early wafers while you're still tuning the machines to survive economically) is what makes foundry challenging and weird.",Negative

AMD,Bottleneck-calculators are absolute pure pseudoscience just like the flat earth theory.   Bottlenecking all depends on the game and graphical settings. There is not a blanket answer to this and any CPU can bottleneck any GPU under the right circumstances.

AMD,Uhh yeah the only difference is the cache....It is like saying a base 4 cylinder mustang is the same as a GT500 because the only difference is the engine. It is a massive difference. I can link to benchmarks all day long showing the uplift that is to be had.  Sure at 4K Ultra with no upscaling you will be generally be GPU bound but that isn't how real people play games. If your card isn't reaching the FPS you want you will adjust the graphical settings until it does. You aren't just going sit there and play at 60FPS if your goal is 144FPS.

AMD,"I don't blame you for not being aware of the constraints.  _The_ bottleneck in FNV _is_ the CPU, full stop.  It can only use two cores.  No matter how powerful your hardware is, the moment the game is rendering one NPC too many (and we are talking about numbers ideally lower than 20), you'll be dropping frames.  Running the game at 120Hz is possible nowadays but anyone doing so has to be aware that they're _not_ going to get that 120Hz all the time.  Even at 60Hz, one needs to balance how much mesh strain they elect to put on the engine.  Too many high detail weapons, too many ""populated""-type mods, and the framerate will crater.  So yeah, I'd certainly rather have the best single-core performance I can get, as that is the literal only thing dictating how far I can push FNV.

AMD,"> But it's not needed really, I run my large Plex server on 9950x3d and transcode using my 4090 and it doesn't even break a sweat.  I understand other people are being aggressive with their responses and I'll try and be more neutral.  First, if you aren't transcoding to users, then transcoding and GPU/APU doesn't matter. You could run Plex off of a raspberry pi or something.  If you start having to transcode, which often happens when you add family and friends to plex, you will be transcoding at some point in that case. You want the best and most efficient transcoding.   The encoder on CPU graphic engines and of course the ones on GPU's are a small part of the hardware. Intel's quick sync is way ahead of Nvidia and even AMD. A recent APU on a more modern Intel CPU will transcode just as well if not better than your graphics card. One of the reasons people are buying ARC GPU's is for Intel's encoder that comes with it. It might not be great for gaming but it's better than any consumer GPU.   Currently most content that people use for plex is H264 for 1080p and H265 for 4k. Most people choose these two over AV1 because AV1 is incredibly hardware intensive. H264 is pretty easy for most encoders but comes with a larger file size. Almost all 4k content will use 265 or AV1, but the compute jump for transcoding AV1 over H265 is a lot. Most people who have transcoded AV1 media will be using an ARC GPU.  Anyways, all of that said. Yes a 4090 can get the job done, but the APU on an Intel CPU or Intel GPU will do more transcodes and it will do it while sipping electricity. That's why people are being terse with you. It's like using a tank to take your children to school when a minivan holds more kids and gets 20 times the gas milage. A N150 beelink for 180 bucks can probably do just as much work and you wouldn't have to worry about turning it off by accident.",Neutral

They took a small problem that very few people actually had and blew it up to make it sound as if everyone who bought Intel was not only stupid, but they also had issues with the 13-14th generation of processors. But remember, Reddit HATES Intel. This site led by the AMD fanboys over at r/pcmasterrace will say anything to make Intel look bad. These kids worship AMD and saying anything against AMD is almost sacrilege. I have had an I7-14700k with 0 issues for over a year now.  I've been building my own PCs since I was 19 years old. That was over 20 years ago. The first PC I bought and built myself was an AMD. (K6-3) And I was the biggest AMD fanboy you could find. You could get more bang for your buck. Intel at the time was vastly more expensive than AMD. So if you didn't have a ton of cash to blow on a new rig, AMD was a better choice. But then came the performance and driver issues that plagued AMD for years. Frequent blue screens, random crashes, coil whine and buggy video drivers. I remember having to find a 3rd party program to de-clock my video card because the sucker would overheat.  When I had some money I decided to splurge and get the Intel I7-920 and an Nvidia card, which was in 2008. Overnight all of my problems disappeared. No more blue screens and random crashes. No more buggy video drivers. I've since used all Asus, Intel and Nvidia parts and I've never had an issue with my PCs other than a failed network adapter on a MoBo that I bought open box. I don't care about the fact that AMD might have slightly better gaming performance. I'm not going to notice that 1% difference when running at max settings.

AMD,"Sure you can calculate it on a per basis situation but that is the total opposite of what a bottleneck calculator does.   The 3D CPU's have lower clock speeds than their non 3D counterparts due to heat and instability at higher speeds due to the extra cache.

If you want or need that extra performance then it is all the worthwhile. Is it worthwhile to you? That all depends on what you are looking to do and get out of your PC.

You don't need need to know the fetch execute decode cycle, how a ALU works, how a pipeline works, how registers work, how branch prediction works, etc. Speaking of specs do you know the 32 SSSE3 instructions?   Probably not and you probably shouldn't either.    This is about gaming and your FPS is the sum of your parts and choices.

You had problems with AMD 17 years ago when AMD and Intel were *very* different companies than they are now. Very likely 99% of the staff isn't even the same. Certainly both AMD and Intel both have had execs come and go, the leadership of both has changed, the computing world has changed. Yet, you continue to write off AMD in 2025 despite that, which really surprises me. You say you were an AMD fanboy back then.. seems like maybe you've become an Intel fanboy instead. Better I think to not be a fanboy at all. I've owned both AMD and Intel, had good success with both. I've been on Intel since about 2010, but had the 7800X3D been out when I bought my 12700K in 2021, you can be sure I would have gone AMD again then, bc the X3D CPUs really *are* the best for gaming (and way more than 1% as you claim).. and bc gaming is my most-demanding use case. Likewise, when I upgrade in a year and a half, I'm certainly going to consider Intel, Nova Lake looks really interesting, but will it perform? I'll wait on independent benchmarks before deciding what I'll get. Logic, not fanboyism.   Idk, seems like AMD (Lisa Su) has the leadership to make good products, and has proven that by doing so. Intel on the other hand, thought it was a great idea to cancel the ""Royal Core"" project led by Jim Keller, thinking mediocre improvements like in the 2010s was the way to go, and has bungled every CPU line after Alder Lake (12th gen), so I've lost confidence in Intel's leadership, for now.   Do as you wish, it's your money, your choice, and maybe Intel will be the best to buy next-gen, but if I buy Intel next time, it'll be because it's the stable AND most-performant choice, and not bc I had a bad experience a human generation ago.",Negative

I already had a PSU from my old build gaming build as well as storage so that saved on costs overall     i had sold the 4090 for exactly £1560 so it cost me exactly £0 overall.",Neutral
AMD,Depends on what you’re doing with it. Shooters don’t care but RTS games usually want all the CPU you can throw at them and more. GPU is a distant third after CPU and RAM.,Neutral
AMD,Yeah I get what you mean.  For the games I play (everything but competitive) a 7800x3D would have been literally double the cost for like no benefit.   Doesnt take long for someone to pop in to say “oh well in this specific game the 7800x3D is better” but the performance even then isn’t worth literally double the price.,Negative
AMD,You must be new to planet earth. You need to spend more time with your elders to understand how they use lol. You're still a child im afraid.,Negative
AMD,"I didn't say it was.  I needed more cores, sold the 5800x for £115. Got the 5950x for £200. For that price, double cores and a little extra boost, no brainer really.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah it is. It has double the L3 cache. It's spread across two CCDs but it still allows other programs to use the ""extra"" bit.",Neutral
AMD,Rocm should be the fix it's just also going to take these software to also update and support it. I don't doubt that once Rocm gets proper support we see a big improvement for amd cards that support it.,Negative

AMD,"It goes to sleep when idling for a bit and wakes up when someone tries to stream from it. Sure the hardware is more powerful and therefore more energy consuming when it's awake, but it also barely has to try at all for any Plex workload, such that I can game at 4k/120 at max settings while multiple people are transcoding and it doesn't matter at all.  It really hasn't changed how I use the computer at all practically speaking, except my extended family bitch if I turn it off going on vacation or something not thinking and then no one has access lol.",Neutral
AMD,"That's why I spent extra on the ironwolf pros, they are pretty quiet (compared to Exos or WD drives). I don't hear them much at all inside Fractal North XL case with glass side.

AMD,Danke,Neutral
AMD,Yeah RTS is a different animal for sure but only holds a small percentage of players. The hype is insane for a small amount of performance. Definitely not a 500$ upgrade but hey if that’s what makes you happy go for it,Positive
AMD,"Man, people aren’t getting it. It’s like talking to a tree. It’s so frustrating to see so many people not understanding what marketing is. Yes, the cpu is better. It cost as much as a 5060ti or a 5070. Like what? You wouldn’t tell the difference without an FPS counter. Idk, it’s just not that big of an upgrade if you can’t notice without a machine counting nanoseconds",Negative
AMD,They’ll dodge all logical points and say “well benchmark YouTube guy says blah blah” like idc about that. If I can’t see a noticeable improvement when I turn the game on and start playing it’s not a 500$ upgrade. Americans are consumers though so oh well,Neutral
AMD,Oh yeah ofc,Neutral
AMD,"Well it’s not the big ole fix, it helps yes and should see a increase in selective benchmarks like blender but it doesn’t matter how good rocm/cuda is if the architecture isn’t made to allow it if that makes sense. Like as I mentioned Nvidia uses a unified architecture meaning their server cards are the same as their desktop (or at least the architecture is the same) while amd uses a split architecture, their mi350x or whatever it’s actually called is their server gpu and is made for handling data, like render servers or ai servers, rdna which is the gaming cards are made for gaming, the drivers and architecture are oriented for it, not saying it can’t do other things, rocm does work and support rdna but rdna isn’t made for these things.    TLDR rocm should help and definitely make them more viable but until we get udna it won’t be a major increase.",Neutral
AMD,"That is not remotely true when it comes to h264/h265/AV1 transcoding. I run a server with dozens of simultaneous users, and all the other server owners I know also choose to run Intel because Quicksync crushes AMD in this field. It's not even a question or opinion",Neutral
AMD,"X3D chips are better if you play fps/competitive games, i play mostly AAA and sometimes fps/competitive games with friends so i figured that its best to get a 7800X3D since it was cheap",Positive
AMD,Yeah I had someone who was like “okay well maybe the average FPS is the same but the 1% lows!”  Like I might be a Neanderthal but I never really see when I have low 1% lows and I’m not spending extra on something that has no benefit to me because I don’t play any competitive games lol?,Negative
AMD,"For AV1 encoding, AMD’s newer 9000 CPUs use AVX 512 instruction set which is far more efficient for AV1 but Intel has it disabled on most of their consumer CPUs because they are still buggy when running AVX 512.  The older shit, sure Intel has the edge with quicksync.",Negative
AMD,Looks like a good build but I'd personally go for a more powerful power supply as if you ever upgrade the GPU it's going to need more. Maybe lower the motherboard to a 650 rather than 850 model and spend the difference on an 850w power supply.,Positive
AMD,"To answer your questions:  * Yes a more powerful GPU would be better, but it's not required. The 9060 XT and it's equivalent 5060 Ti are okay for 1440p gaming, just don't expect max settings, and be ready to use FSR/DLSS upscaling. 9070/5070, 9070XT/5070Ti would be ideal of course.  * I also use a B650 mobo and it's fine for what it is. Get a fancier mobo if you want better IO like 10gbit/20gbit/40gbit USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 or USB4/Thunderbolt.  * The 9700X could be worth it for just 20 euro more, if you plan on rendering/encoding video or anything else that likes higher core count CPUs.  * 750W is more future proofed if you, in the future, want to upgrade to an RX 10070 XT or RTX 6070 Ti or similar. 850W would be even better.  As a bonus tip - please consider the Odyssey G50D instead of the G51C. The G5 G50D is IPS and 180Hz. The one you picked is VA, which has worse motion clarity and viewing angles.",Neutral
AMD,"Thank, I'll have a look at the 850W power supplies.",Positive
AMD,P.s. Yes if your budget can stretch further try and get a 9070 or even 9070xt,Positive
AMD,"Thanks for all your answers!  I don't really need the additional IOs so maybe I can spare some budget by choosing a B650 mobo and invest in a 850W power supply instead.  I don't plan on anything like video encoding, so I guess I can keep the 7600X.  Thanks for the bonus tip, I was not aware of the difference between VA and IPS, I will have a look.",Positive
AMD,Good luck. The Samsung Odyssey monitors are quality too. You should have a lot of fun with it. Also I'm sure you know but just in case don't pay full price for windows 11. You can buy a key for about £15 from various places like Groupon.,Positive
AMD,"Before buying a 850W PSU consider if you'll be upgrading in the next 5 years. If not, and you upgrade in 5+ years, it's probably better to get a new PSU then anyways, as they tend to perform worse as they age. I wouldn't trust a 5+ year old 850W PSU to handle a system with a 300W+ GPU (who knows, maybe the RTX 7070 Ti will be a 450W part and the minimum will be 300 for lesser GPUs of 2030) and everything else on top of that.",Negative

AMD,"Great card man. Enjoy it, I’d say 🙂. Don’t worry about all that nonsense being spread around",Positive
AMD,You should never buy 6000 series to begin with in 2024. DLSS was already taken off and preset E was in general giving people better than native quality starting from 4k performance mode. Now preset K is getting previously quality level image with performance mode and it even runs in a potato RTX2060 thanks to its tensor core support.  A weak RTX4060 have double the matrix compute performance of a 7900XTX is a huge red light.,Negative
AMD,If I didn't play games that played very well with Linux I'd be fuming right now....,Neutral
AMD,How’s it been performing and what’s the power draw?,Neutral
AMD,"they need to fire their business suits because they must be retarded thinking pulling the plug on 5 year old products will grow their business in the future.   also, the 7000 series most likely sold worse than the 6000. shouldn't they stop support that one instead by your logic?",Negative
AMD,"It's likely just a guy profiling new releases for shader bottlenecks.  Nvidia moved it over to AI, which is why the drivers on their side are sucky now too.  AMD just has the dude taking 3 hour lunch breaks just to be spiteful.",Negative

AMD,I hope you know that OP is very misinformed and they are not stopping support... Just read the new article and move on,Negative
AMD,6700 XT still kicking here so fuck em,Negative
AMD,or Intel,Neutral
AMD,Optimization is them making the card run better for specific games. The software that installs with it if you choose to install it is called Adrenaline.,Positive
AMD,5700XT Pref is same as 1080TI And 3060 AND EVEN THE 5050 and the b570 which are still enough for modern standards even at 1440p   indiana jones that requires RT can still run Medium settings At 1080p when using RT emulation bypass on linux. can confirm it works as 5600XT owner. would expect at least 2 more years then it would be resonable. but damn thats a shitty move,Negative
AMD,And then in 5 years Intel will drop the GPU side since their CPUs are frying themselves,Neutral
AMD,"nope, that doesn't really change anything and they're still ambiguous with their language, ""market needs"" wtf does that even mean...   the reality is what matters, and the reality is that they already moved these cards into another branch that won't get the same amount of work and support as before, as long as missing out on new vulkan extensions and versions, and also won't get fsr4 lite or whatever, which was already proven to work completely fine  it's really just amd trying to save face, while saying a whole load of nothing",Negative
AMD,"Yep the 6750 XT GRE 10GB released October 18, 2023. I bought the 6950XT on launch day for GPU bubble prices back in May 2022.  Boneheaded decision by AMD.  I bought a 7900 XTX on the 9th of this month. I'd return it, but the closest Nvidia equivalent of what I bought is twice as expensive (a white, RGB 4080 for my wife's all white, all rgb build).

AMD,<Points at all the threads where I've told people the 9000 series is a better long term option>  As for the Steam Deck and PS5 - irrelevant. Consoles work on the concept of fixed specifications.,Neutral
AMD,I dont understand why youre mad. its for the 5000 and 6000 series. the 7000 series will still recieve support.,Negative
AMD,"I feel the same, I own a 7000 series card, but this news leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  If they are doing this to cards that can be considered recent, then the 7000 cards might be on the block sooner rather than later.",Negative

It's literally one of AMD's most popular RDNA2 cards and is still relevant for modern 1080p/1440p gaming at 50-60 FPS medium-high settings, especially with the 12 GB VRAM.

AMD,Im in the same boat.,Neutral
AMD,I bought a 6800XT >5 years ago. I replaced it this year.  I'm not really too surprised about a 5 year old GPU that is in the grandparent generation of modern cards being put from mainstream to support to extended/security updates only support. It's not like it's dead or being totally unsupported. In a couple of years it'll be very long in the tooth anyway and we'll probably have the next generation of cards available.,Neutral

AMD,Sometimes I wonder are they on drugs?.,Neutral
AMD,It's funny that nvidia gets most the hate but also provides the best long term support of any hardware manufacturer. But we don't say that here because nvidia is evil.,Negative
AMD,"funny thing is that nvidia offers software support for even the 10 series at this point, which is almost 10 years old, while AMD is killing off a 2 generation old product  the fact that AMD only charges like 50 bucks less than nvidia for comparable cards while killing them off in half the time is pretty damn gross",Negative
AMD,Ahh yes good guy AMD,Positive
AMD,AMD is the savior because if it wasn't for AMD and their Vega propaganda we would have never gotten GTX 1080 Ti 11gb or we would have gotten it at like much more expensive price  Because of AMD we have a really cheap really powerful legendary card that is the GTX 1080 Ti,Positive
AMD,"you're far too optimistic with it  the options are either A: An overpriced brick with a fire hazard connector but with 10 years of driver support  or B: the same fucking GPU but without the fire hazard connector, less software features and 4 years of driver support for 50 to 100 bucks less  remember that with the 90 seres AMD decided to go with the same amount of VRAM as nvidia",Negative
AMD,> better fps/watt than RDNA4   Bruh,Positive
AMD,"I have never fangirled for AMD, maybe you should check out the goomba fallacy",Neutral
AMD,"Great resale value too. Buying 24GB+ Nvidia cards is smart, you can still get £600+ off your next purchase many years later since demand for lots of VRAM shows no sign of abating.",Positive

AMD,"RDNA 1 released in 2019, 6 years   RDNA 2 released in 2020, 5 years",Neutral
AMD,"Afaik 9070 xt doesn't come close to competing with the high-end and is instead a VERY good competitor to the current generations mid-tier with the 5070 ti from Nvidia.    I'd say it's mostly because the high-end doesn't sell as much and it's more the profit from such inflated prices that makes the 5080 and 5090 viable for Nvidia whilst it's been consistently shown, with some outliers, that mid-tier cards sell the most.",Positive
AMD,"And they are a bad value on productivity. To the point pudgetbenchmarks doesn't even use them to compare. And on 3D...worst...

AMD,Yeah that's what I was thinking as well. Steam Deck seemed like a better deal from the begging but now it sounds like it's even better in comparison to the ally,Positive
AMD,You can put steam is on the Xbox rog ally...hell my rog ally Z1E has bazzite on it,Negative
AMD,Did they make a statement? The driver patch notes still imply that only 7000 and 9000 series will receive new game ready driver support  https://preview.redd.it/ltmko8usnhyf1.jpeg?width=892&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa85224a1bcdbcbd2c9e4d32178d864cb0300fb1,Neutral

AMD,That’s what I believe too,Neutral
AMD,doesn't change anything really,Neutral
AMD,to me that only says that the decision was made and nothing is gonna change,Negative
AMD,"That doesn't mean shit, fuck does market needs mean?",Negative
AMD,"This makes sense. I've been perplexed by this whole thing since early yesterday. AMD literally has RDNA2 products on shelves still, they can't possibly be moving it to a state where it won't get game optimizations already. They'd probably end up getting hit with a class action from people actively buying hand helds lol",Negative
AMD,"yeah, amd really spreads lots of nonsense",Neutral
AMD,"Don't give them ideas.  The 7xxx series is still in production so it won't be dropped, yet.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah … but the 6800 is also two tiers (or 18% - https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/compare/4322vs4314/Radeon-RX-6900-XT-vs-Radeon-RX-6800) Slower than the 6900XT.  And the time of purchase also plays a role. I bought the 6900XT during the Cryptocrisis for 1300€, when it went for 1500€ usually, assuming rising prices. When I checked, the 6800XT (didn't check for non XT) was 1100-1200€ street prise. Scalpers drove the prices crazy high. If you got your 6800 XT in late 23, when the craze was over and the 7000 Series was released, it obviously was way cheaper.",Neutral
AMD,"It means when they blackmail enough people to putting them back at at least 10% market share, they'll start to become consumer friendly again.",Negative
AMD,"this literally doesn't change anything tho, these cards are still gonna be moved into another maintenance branch that won't ever get the same amount of work or support as before, and also won't get fsr4 lite of whatever that was already proven to work just fine. rage still 101% deserved",Negative
AMD,But AMD has all the good side of their CPU market. Still releasing AM4 CPUs that kick ass at affordable prices.,Positive
AMD,"And you must change because of what? Vega 64 is not getting updates for past 2 years and it runs modern games just fine, it's still as fast as GTX 1080 despite GTX 1080 ""getting"" updates.",Neutral
AMD,"not misinformation, nothing really changed",Negative
AMD,Me and my money will move on.  AMD dropped the new article only because of the backlash.,Negative
AMD,Maybe we have different standards is probably why. I am going to retire this card once I get my 5080 at the end of this year and upgrade my main PC. And move over my 3080 over to my office build. But once I see a gpu cant run games at 1080p high Imo it’s time to let go. I play BF6 at 1440p on the 3080 still 100 FPS+ high but this 5700xt all settings low at 1080p and barely getting 100fps+ with FSR quality on. I prioritize high fps. Yeah that’s why I said it’s time to let go for newer games. I think what’s confusing people is its support for newer games. Older games that ran fine will still run good. But I’m not playing games at low settings just me,Neutral
AMD,"You're in denial, great.  If you have to quote the article, quote it completely.  >""New features, bug fixes and game optimizations will continue to be delivered as required by market needs in the maintenance mode branch""  Let me break it down to you, barney style:  >New features, bug fixes and game optimizations will continue to be delivered  Those are the keywords.

AMD,"Unless the NVIDA decided to follow the steps of AMD to EOS the GPU of 3 years or oldest to maximum their profits while hurting the loyal customers. But that's the future I hope not to come.

AMD,Arc B770 if it ever happens.,Neutral
AMD,AMD always seems to fumble the bag somehow,Negative
AMD,"GTX 1000 series support will end this month (October). But keeping security updates each quarterly. Now Nvidia is basically only optimizing drivers for RTX 2060 and above, which makes sense for games that have DLSS and ray tracing.",Neutral
AMD,RX 6750 XT and RX 6650XT were released just 3 years ago.,Neutral
AMD,Why are you making shit up?,Negative
AMD,"Stream Deck is not a console. I’m not sure if they are affected or not but they are rdna 2 so I just said maybe they would be. Also, the 9000 series did not exist when I bought my card.",Negative
AMD,First they came for the 5000 and 6000 series and I did not speak out for I did not have a 5000 or 6000 series. Then they came for me…,Neutral
AMD,But going by this I can expect them to stop supporting the 7000 series sometime in the next 2 years  I really need to put bazzite on my main computer,Negative
AMD,"I bought an open-box 6750xt for my wife 2 years ago on a great deal and even I feel slighted. I could understand them announcing that they're sunsetting the 5000 series in 6 months or something like that, but kneecapping the 6000 series is just bonkers.",Negative
AMD,"The 6650, 6750 and 6950 were released in 2023",Neutral
AMD,"Didn’t even think of that, good point.",Positive
AMD,To be fair RDNA 2 is 5 years old at this point. I wouldn't expect much in retail value the time to sell them was after RDNA 3 launch. Now its 2 Gen's old I don't know many people in the used market that would buy a used one in 2026+. You are already better off buying something from the current generation.,Neutral
AMD,There is a binned XTXH which is what I have it came in red devil and handful of others top end skus. Forgot about the H lol   Nobody was paying the steep price of red devils most expensive variant so it was the only 6900xt model to buy at the time lmao,Neutral
AMD,Their pricing just sucks. That’s the only issue I have with them. their support is great.,Negative
AMD,Hell even my 1080 got a battlefield 6 driver!,Negative

AMD,Or you can get a RX 9070 XT WITH 12PWR connector because you love chaos.,Neutral
AMD,>The 30 series also won’t get DLSS frame gen nor smooth motion    They do have DLSS 4 transformer upscaling that runs well  >game optimizations hardly happen on anything but the newest gen   Based on?,Negative
AMD,"It does have AMD frame generation, though and does get access to the transformer model of DLSS upscaling.",Neutral
AMD,"But they *will* get game support   Which one is more important? Fake frames, or the game straight up buggy? Yeah, that's what I thought",Negative
AMD,"Having a better upscaler is better than fake frames, plus if he wants frame gen, he can buy lossless scalling, which only costs  $7 to get frame gen.",Positive
AMD,"Tbh, dlss frame gen is a fat piece of shit",Negative
AMD,"If you overclock the shit out of it and cite very specific benchmarks the 9070xt trades punches with the 5080 on raster situationally.  It's a whole thing people point to when talking up the 9070xt.  Mind you I'm not complaining that the card can do that, I think it's pretty damn neat, but it's just an interesting fact more than a compelling reason to recommend the card.

AMD,You get game optimizations for overall driver stuff they just wont bother with hard to fix rdna 2 specific bugs. Basically and is killing fine wine on rdna 1 and 2.   Nvidia does this day 1 on new gen.  So bf6 has some minor graphic issues on 5000 series nvidia nvidia will fix this if 6000 series was out they wont because its low priority but if it affected all nvidia cards or 5 and 6000 series it gets fixed.,Negative
AMD,"The 6x50 cards were released in May of 2022, they're 3 year old cards. The 6x50 GRE cards were released in Oct of 2023.   2 fucking years old and getting full support neutered is insane work by AMD.",Negative

AMD,True. Good point,Positive
AMD,"they already said they won't be updating the vulkan driver or giving out any new vulkan extension, learn what happened to Polaris with vulkan games or emulators like baldur's gate 3 that constantly crashes, or rpcs3 that just updated their minimum requirement implying it's no longer supported on polaris. does that mean fsr 4 is coming then? :p",Neutral
AMD,>Unless the NVIDA decided to follow the steps of AMD to EOS the GPU of 3 years or oldest to maximum their profits while hurting the loyal customers.  Nvidia kind of doesn't have to if only having 8GB of vram motivates people to upgrade on their own.,Negative
AMD,"The problem is the Radeon option isn't *that* much more expensive than the comparable Nvidia option in most cases.  For the 9070XT you can find the 5070TI within $100 or less of it usually, the biggest difference is on the low end with the 9060XT 16 $80 cheaper than the 5060ti 16.  Idk, if AMD was consistently 30-40% cheaper it might make sense to go with it.  But as things stand you might as well just pay the extra Nvidia tax of $100 or whatever so you know you have long term driver support.  Plus even though FSR4 is improved a lot DLSS is still better and has way wider game support.",Neutral
AMD,It's not effected because Linux is not effected by this change at all. Amd drivers on linux are open source and are not only developed by amd. Valve and many other companies contribute as well. On linux even Amd GCN cards (from around 2012 iirc) still receive relatively regular updates,Neutral
AMD,"That can be argued. It's irrefutably a console like experience. All the examples of a model are the same, like a PS5. Unlike a ""PC"" where there's millions of permutations.  I guess you meant Steam Deck. Stream Deck is a multi-button control surface. 😉",Neutral

AMD,AMD has been FAR worse when it comes to product availability and princing (relative to MSRP) than nvidia in most of the world with the 9000 series,Negative
AMD,Who does that?,Neutral
AMD,"And it makes sense too. Since the 1000 series pretty much disappeared from system requirements of new releases for the most part. RX 6000 still has a good few years with how performant it is - what's killing it is not the hardware aging, but AMD themselves.",Neutral
AMD,"I like how he mentions frame gen when it's the *least important* DLSS/FSR/XeSS feature of any of them, atleast for desktop cards.  >Based on?  Based on what he just pulled from his ass.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah but if you just make things up you see, Nvidia bad.",Negative
AMD,Nvidia stops optimizing for past gen day 1 of new architecture people used to attribute half of that to and fine when when you compare amd and nvidia gens 2 years after release but if you look similar nvidia performing cards fall down because they only do generic driver fixes for old gen.   Basically amd is stopping fine wine on older cards.,Negative

AMD,"First, we don’t know how often they will be releasing drivers. Second, most people sat on 566.36 for months when Nvidia was releasing dogshit drivers.   Point being, not getting day 1 driver updates and optimizations  won’t suddenly make the gpu unusable in games.  Again, not justifying AMD, just saying this isn’t much better.",Negative
AMD,"Idk what you're going on about, but DLSS frame gen is absolutely fantastic in single player games and is easily the best implementation of frame gen currently available",Positive
AMD,"I'm not really talking about that though. I mean sure overclockers like to push GPUs to the brink, doesn't mean it's stable in games just in benchmarks.    It's a mid-tier card at an attractive price point and amazing performance.",Neutral
AMD,Honestly this seems like a reaction to the pushback and conflicts with previous statements.   Anyways it's too early for the 6000 series to stop receiving both features and game optimization updates,Negative
AMD,"Yeah, that means AMD may never bother fixing these specific bugs for 6000 and 5000 cards at all because they don't have to! which doesn't make sense because these GPUs are still being sold in the market in new conditions, and they are relatively young of age.",Negative
AMD,"we understand, still doesn't make it any better, it's like the minimum expectation",Negative
AMD,It's crazy how opposite it is compared to AMD versus Intel when it comes to CPUs. Specifically how long AMD keeps their sockets relevant.,Neutral
AMD,"So a solution here, is to install Linux if you've got one of these cards",Neutral
AMD,Steam Deck is closer to a laptop than a console. It does all the computer shit and runs Steam instead of a console store. You can run anything on it that will run on Linux including emulators and stuff from epic and GOG.,Neutral

AMD,That's country dependant though. Here in Germany the 9070xt has been below msrp for months now while the 5070ti is around msrp,Neutral
AMD,Nvidia. They prioritize commercial products.  Edit: anybody who doesn't believe it should look into Nvidia VRAM and how they allocate it between different product lines. Just saying. Seems like a lot of people out here Stan'ing for Nvidia.,Neutral
AMD,"The 6000 series is some of AMD's best work in the graphics department, killing RDNA 2 support is completely and utterly retarded. To this day, it's AMDs only modern ""full stack"" lineup (meaning bottom of the barrel sub 75W cards to 90 class cards)  and they still don't have a replacement for lots of their lower tier cards. This was an efficient, and effective gaming architecture that was reasonably priced and didn't have completely dogshit drivers like 5000 and 7000. This is a sad day for 6000 series users.",Negative
AMD,"Side note, but I think FG will soon be seen as essential as upscaling       CPU progression has slowed to a crawl, but games want more  CPU power   You see in DF coverage capping the framerate to keep the CPU from maxing has huge consistency wins   FG is going to be pretty much the only way to access consistent high framerates going forward",Neutral

AMD,"Dual GPU FG would go the same way as SLI, almost nowhere",Neutral
AMD,So assuming Nvidia do what AMD are explicitly telling you they do,Neutral
AMD,"There will likely be cases of that   Both are arguing the extreme. The bulk of games will work fine. But driver optimisation does make a difference, just not all the time",Neutral
AMD,"SLI had terrible support, required identical cards and offered no real gaming experience improvements outside of 3 benchmarks.  When we get to the point when FG becomes essential and the ""standard"", having a 60 series card doing FG for a 80 series card for a substantial gain and reduction in input delay will become a lot more appealing to people.",Negative
AMD,>reduction in input delay will become a lot more appealing to people.   I doubt it will be enough to warranty and entire second GPU,Neutral
AMD,I was looking at 6700's just recently for a new build. Does this mean it would be a bad idea?,Neutral
AMD,Can anyone explain like I’m 5  Why did they remove the USB-C functionality and what are the ramifications of this? I’ve never used my 7900XTX’s USB-C port.,Negative
AMD,And I'm still with my RX 6600...,Neutral
AMD,Lol at me for buying a 1000€ 6900xt when it came out. No new game support after such a short time. Ridiculous,Negative
AMD,"This makes 0 sense and is such a trash move by AMD as 6800XT and 6900XT are still very capable cards and beloved by the community. These companies and their idiotic decisions in which they think will generate more profit can easily backfire, hope it does.",Negative
AMD,"What the fuck I bought my 6700xt in 2023, this is balls",Negative
AMD,The consoles are still running 6000 series. This makes no sense.,Negative
AMD,"Well, fuck, they ended support earlier than I thought for the 6000 cards. I bought the 6900xt in 2021 lol.   There goes any hope of fsr4 support for us.",Negative
AMD,"Excuse me, what the actual fuck, I upgraded to the Rx 6800 XT from the GTX 1060 6gb and they both loose driver support at the same time? Is this some kind of a Halloween joke? GPU have never really stabilized after the crypto rush and then got into the AI slop era immediately. Gaming is really in the worst place ever.",Negative
AMD,"Wow. thats what i get for supporting the ""underdog""(gpu) when the difference isnt to great. (performance per dollar within my budget and need).  And i dont understand why this isnt getting more traction than it currently is getting, this is setting a really terrible precidence. Im pissed",Negative
AMD,"I can understand not perpetually supporting a card with new features, but it seems a little sneaky and very unnecessary to disable existing functionality such as with this USB port.",Negative
AMD,Disabling that USB port seems dicky? If it causes issues then it's on them to fix these and not keep it broken.,Negative
AMD,"It's almost as if this is one of the reasons AMD is In a distant second place, Nvidia JUST dropped the 10 series which is almost a decade old.",Negative
AMD,"This seems really premature for the 6000 series cards.   The 5000 series I can kind of get because they lack the ability to do RT and weren't *that* popular.   But 6000 series production only ended what, 3-4 years ago?   The rx 6700 and up are still very capable gpus.",Negative
AMD,"That's disappointing, looking that Nvidia just ended support to cards released between... 2014 and 2016.",Negative
AMD,"It's insane to me that AMD are cutting adrift graphics cards from 2 generations ago (6000 series).  On the CPU side they continue to support AM4, and word is the next generation of CPUs will still work on AM5.  How does this company not have a coherent company-wide philosophy for legacy product support?  This isn't even hardware.  It's software.  There is no technological reason for them to stop supporting these GPUs--only greed and laziness.",Negative
AMD,Ah yes.. the same AMD who's first dedicated card comes in at *#29...* on the Steam Hardware Survey and who's LATEST GEN Cards arent even registering on the Steam Hardware Survey at all (I know about the bug but they arent even caring to fix that either).  I understand you cant maintain tech forever.. but this seems stupid if you are trying to retain/encourage consumers.  Look at Intel. Forcing people to get new Mobo/CPUs every 2 years drove their customers to the multi year platform of AM4.,Negative
AMD,"4-5 years is unacceptable for game driver support on the RX 6000 series. If Nvidia can give game support to the bloody GTX 1660 Ti & RTX 2060, why the hell can AMD not be bothered to give it to cards like the RX 6700 (Which is the bloody PS5 GPU) or RX 6900 XT. Reeks of laziness.",Negative
AMD,"This is such a shit move by AMD    I guess no matter what GPUs we decide to buy, we still will get fucked by the corpos",Negative
AMD,"Seriously? wtf AMD   How to fuck with consumer trust in one simple step. I wonder when they will do the same for 7000 or 9000 series cause imagine buying such card for 3 or more years of usage for pottentially having been cut from features (or worse, drivers if they decide to fuck us even further)",Negative
AMD,"I bought a Waterforce 6900XT last year because it was on sale, my 2080TI crapped out, already had a water block on it, and I wanted to take advantage of resizable BAR with my 5800X3D build.  Well this sucks.",Negative
AMD,Wow! And here I was floating my next GPU decision between AMD and nVidia. If AMD means I'll need to buy a new GPU every 4 years I'll just stick with the folks still updating my 7 year old 2080.,Neutral
AMD,I love how all companies trying their best to make me quit this hobby.   My 6700xt will be the last gpu from amd. I may ditch my cpu too.   This gotta be one of the scammest things i have ever seen in my entire life.  Ill gladly to stay away from this company for good.,Negative
AMD,"Nah, I just got 6750xt and was talking about how well it runs 1440p, telling my friends to switch from green team. Not anymore",Neutral
AMD,"We were receiving new features? As far as I know even rocm still isn't supported on my card.   > new features, like the latest Battlefield 6 update    Oh, they call the bare minimum of maintenance a feature. Fuck amd why did I give them the benefit of the doubt after buying a fucking buggy rx5700xt before.",Negative
AMD,Makes me regret buying my 9070xt now...  This is absolutely insane. The card came out recently and can still run modern games. Huh?,Negative
AMD,"Because this offended the mods elsewhere for who knows what reason:  Not that I'm team this or that (I don't give a fuck about any of that, I go where the performance is for whatever I'm shelling out at the time) but this definitely pushes me more toward a certain other team.  Because, what the fuck is this? My card (6900 XT) will only just turn 5 in December and it's already being relegated? Meanwhile, Nvidia is still supporting the 900-series cards for the next three years, albeit only with quarterly updates — full-time support ended, what, this month? 11 years of support and this is getting relegated after 5?  Fuck off. Properly.",Negative
AMD,"I get not supporting older cards. That happens, though this does seem a little premature. The 6000 series was released 4 years ago. And on the other side of that, we have the Nvidia 10 series that stopped receiving update earlier this year. They were released 9 years ago. Pretty big difference.   But disabling the USB C port is insane. What reason do they have for that? Just let people use it as a standard USB C port, or continue to use it for DP over USB C for VR if they already are.   Cant wait to see all the AMD fanboys in PCMR flock here to try and justify this one.",Negative
AMD,So what does the practically mean? How long until games won’t run on 6000 series cards or they have issues with operating systems?,Neutral
AMD,I have a 6800XT and I haven't seen any updates for game compatibilities in more than a year... so this changes basically nothing I guess?,Negative
AMD,"So this is from AMD's Duscord channel about the USB Type-C on the Radeon RX 7900 series GPU: We’d like to inform you that the release notes for AMD Software Adrenalin Edition 25.10 2 posted included misinformation that has since been corrected. There is no change to USB-C functionality on the RX 7900 series GPUs in the 25.10.2 driver. There was an incorrect line in the originally posted release notes that has been removed, and the release notes have been updated.   We apologize for any inconvenience.",Negative
AMD,This is really bad right? People were irritated that the 10 series was losing support earlier this year and the 6000 series is like half as old even the 5000 series is not particularly old.,Negative

AMD,"Ok what the actual fuck i have a 6700xt and can run any game pretty decently and most of them at 165fps stable, why they will stop receiving features? Those GPU are more than capable on 2025",Negative
AMD,"We got Nvidia cranking the damn prices to oblivion and we got AMD dropping support for less than 5 year old GPUs that are still in tons of builds.  I can't believe I'd be saying this, but Intel might be the future of the consumer GPU market if they make the right business moves in the next few years and capitalize on this.",Negative
AMD,Wondering how much I could get for my 6700xt and grab a 5070.,Neutral
AMD,"Think I might just pay the nvidia tax next time I upgrade my GPU. Still won't do that until games become literally unplayable for me, but yeah, pretty bad look to axe driver support after a measly 4 years.",Negative
AMD,If prior cards are any history the Linux kernel will keep them supported for a few decades.,Neutral
AMD,Well that puts the nail in the coffin for me. Only Nvidia cards for me from now on. I have a 6800xt that works great and it's not that old.   Trash behavior.,Negative
AMD,"Yeah these fucking shitstatins can go fuck themselves that's for sure.  My laptop gtx 960m which released in 2015 and is based on a gtx 750 ti is still getting updates, but my 4 year old 6700xt isn't going to be getting shit now?  These fuckers truly never miss an opportunity to miss do they.",Negative
AMD,"So not only do they essentially end support for 5, 6 series, this is a guaranteed nail that it will not receive FSR4. I got my 6600 in 2022. So 3 years and it originally dropped in 2020? I think. So 5 year support and instantly dropping it.  At least for me.. I'm not sure i want another amd product. Prices have been higher than msrp, drivers are pretty ass, still tons of bugs. They take months! MONTHS! To release stable drivers with bug fixes everyone's been asking for. The program itself is buggy, slow. It constantly kills itself and you have to restart it. Generally all of this is excusable for products under msrp and is within its product limits of hardware.  Yeah big yikes amd... not too sure about your future.",Negative
AMD,"Even as a 9070xt buyer this is absolutely infuriating. Confirms that AMD won't be pursuing long-term support of their products, massively decreasing their resale value. Damn!",Negative
AMD,I bought my 6900 XT as a birthday gift with my new job in 2022.  It's already getting dropped? Why??,Negative
AMD,What about the Steam Deck?,Neutral
AMD,"What does that mean for the USB port?  Can you still use VR headsets?   (I never owned one but, AFAIK, this is the use-case for it).  I would be glad that someone explains this to me.",Neutral
AMD,Haha good thing I didn't spend 300 dollars on a used 6000 series gpu then haha....,Positive
AMD,I guess this kills any chances of an official FSR4 version for RDNA2 and RDNA3 GPUs. Booooo!,Neutral
AMD,I paid £600 for my 6950XT in June 2023 and I don't even get the BF6 update?  My shits lagging af from a memory leak and is unplayable - not sure if that's a driver issue or game issue but I'm quite annoyed over this. It wasn't cheap.,Negative

AMD,"No way, only 4.5 years after release 6000 series lose driver support for new games.  This is akin to nVIDIA abandoning 3000 series cards, meanwhile Rx 6000 series are even 0.5 year newer!  People would not let NVidia live that down! There would be crusades.",Negative
AMD,Oh okay so between still being on AM4 and using a 6700 I'm double fucked.   Anyone interested in some hairy feet pics? /s,Negative
AMD,I thought my RX 6800 (non xt) was gonna carry me through for a long time. Like the RX 480 and 580.   Does that mean the shelf life for the 7000 and 9000 will last for another year and a half?  Gotta say I'm bummed to buy anything new.,Negative
AMD,"What bastards, what the fuck",Negative
AMD,"I bought an expensive card specifically so I would have less to worry about in terms of upgrading. Do I just turn off updates and hope for the best, or lose my USB-C port?",Neutral
AMD,"Oh I bet this is how they weasel their way out of giving RDNA2 INT8 FSR4 despite modders having literally shown it works and reviewers like HUB testing it out. Dicks, my 6950 XT I bought two and a half years ago and it only released 3 and a half years ago ffs.",Negative
AMD,"Don't get too comfortable, AMD",Negative
AMD,"Me, still on a RX580...  Soooooo do I need to upgrade?",Neutral
AMD,People shit on Nvidia for cutting support for 7 year old cards. This is even worse,Negative
AMD,"AMD really wants to move from their prior gen. As quickly as possible.   They underestimated the market when it came to AI and now realize they can’t ignore it.  The problem is they have been ignoring it for too long and now have prior generations of products that really don’t have a path to fit in with their current model.   Nvidia on the other hand was laying the ground work starting with 20 series and why they can STILL have some carryover support for new features and keep things going. Their whole line up has a single trajectory and don’t require different teams and feature sets because their products are scattered all over the place. It’s why some features DLSS4 went back to supporting 20 series.   AMD can’t do that because they never laid down that groundwork. They’re JUST NOW starting to work the their current gen 90xx cards, that means they need to back away from prior gens as soon as possible to focus on this and future generations.   5000, 6000 now, 7000 probably isn’t that far off either.",Neutral

AMD,"Wait, my 7900XTX has a USB-C port??",Neutral
AMD,"Not sure i understand why tf they would disable the usb-c features. I mean, what did it hurt them to just leave it as it was? Seems kinda like when they nerf a character in a game because they think its too OP. However, nerfing a product that youve paid for is bs. Also, what exactly is “maintenance mode”?",Negative
AMD,Geezus AMD has never been good with GPU support... Kepler got like 13 years of game ready drivers,Negative
AMD,"At this point it's not even worth recommending AMD saying that they have 16GB compared to a 5070, since if they last 2 years of support with 12GB maybe for 2 years you can still play at 1440p, clowns",Negative
AMD,Is this the AMD FineWine I keep hearing about? They keep making me regret going with them for my last gpu,Negative
AMD,FML just built a second PC for living room with a 6800XT. This stinks.,Neutral
AMD,"AMD seriously reconsider, you'll hurt future GPU sales with this move. Can they open / community source it or something so people don't regret supporting them?",Negative
AMD,AMD decided to make the GPU and CPU parts of the company polar opposite for some reason?,Negative
AMD,"That's really bad, like wtf amd?",Negative
AMD,"So I have an odd question about the disabling of the usb-c port on the 7900 series. So does it fully not work to display on, say, a usb-c dock at all now?",Neutral
AMD,From what I've heard Nvidia works right out the box no tweaks yess some have less v ram but the same performance as amd if not better and on the other hand with my personal experience both my cards the rx580 and the rx6800 have crashed my pc multiple times unless I tweak setting this is with 3 different PC setups so imo if this is all true fuck amd cards in the future and watch that end of their company fold just as they were doing pretty well maybe they are just going to focus on cpus and new architecture but to end support for these cards this soon while still selling them new seems like a huge scam,Negative
AMD,"Shit, c'mon AMD do better. If they're going to be like this my next card I will be going back to NVIDIA. My GTX 960 on an old machine just got another update.",Negative
AMD,"Damn, I guess the wine went off...",Negative
AMD,"Ah, that OpenAI deal really made them stop caring huh. Alright then, we will remember this.",Negative
AMD,That's a dick move.  And they're still selling those cards??  What tf is that?   As much as everyone bitches about Nvidia.  They at least stick by their products and support them for the long haul.,Negative

AMD,Lesson learn; bought an rx 6700 XT two years ago after quitting Nvidia.  Never again ! It's such a sh.. move to your customers.,Negative
AMD,"I had my 6950xt for almost 3 years now, i was always so fucking happy with how well that purchase turned out as i skiped a 3080 for this card.  Turns out fuck me i guess i should have gone for the 3080 for 100 bucks more, at least I would still have gaming driver updates.   I'm running this card until i can upgrade and then never toching another amd card ever again, fucking bastards.",Negative
AMD,"Hopefully intel can start really competing soon with gpus, amd and nvidia are both so shit lmao",Negative
AMD,It’s not like the GPUs stop working after that,Neutral
AMD,There is a lot of hysterical over-reaction to this. The 5000 and 6000 series cards are still going to be supported. The worst that will happen is that they will miss out on very minor tweaks that are added to drivers for later cards - additions that will make no significant difference to most users.,Negative
AMD,"Yes. It won't receive support for new games.  From the driver announcement directly: ""New Game Support and Expanded Vulkan Extensions Support is available to Radeon RX 7000 and 9000 series graphics products.""  https://www.techpowerup.com/download/amd-radeon-graphics-drivers/",Neutral
AMD,"It will be fine. Just because they aren't adding new features doesn't mean that the existing ones won't be supported. Most ""new features"" are very minor tweaks that make very little real-world difference anyway.",Neutral
AMD,"I bought an used 6700xt just this week, chose it over similar priced Nvidia models cause of the 12gb vram, thought it'll age better. Shit luck I guess.",Negative
AMD,"They've clarified it as a bad press release.  Game ready drivers, bug fixes, and security updates will still be issued but new features won't be backported to 6x series and below.",Negative
AMD,"This is great idea, because this gpu have to cost less now. Also never heard about GPU can't play games because there are no support. Radeon 580 is abandoned 5 years ago and works great for 70$",Positive
AMD,Its fine if you can get it cheap.,Positive
AMD,Depends on what games you play. Most games will run fine. Its mostly about new games and special features. Still isnt great though and id consider this evaluating a price.,Neutral
AMD,"I have an rx 6750 xt released 3.5 years ago, support cutoff is too early.",Negative
AMD,"The USB-C port is a VirtualLink port that provides 27w of power to anything plugged into it, a DisplayPort (iirc 1.3 or 1.4?) connection, and USB 3.1 support for data transfer. This means you cannot use it for fast charging/Power Delivery, or acting as a regular USB-C 3.1 port once its disabled. It will only be able to drive a montor with DP if the monitor gets power from somewhere else since its now been disabled on the VirtualLink port.  Its a cool little port that could do loads of other things like support and power an external drive bay but unfortunately it died off because VR didn't hit as mainstream as companies liked and valve/htc never managed or bothered to make a Virtual Link adapter that would handle all of your headsets data, display, and power needs. iirc only the PSVR2 makes use of its intended purpose which came out 5 years after we first saw these on the RTX 20 series GPUs",Neutral
AMD,"AMD stated on their discord it was an error and that line doesn't show anymore in the change log, not sure if it's true or not because I cannot test it",Negative
AMD,"First time I heard about them having a usbc port, I have an XTX spectral white and mine doesn't have it, nor did any of the ones I saw when looking up prices.",Negative
AMD,Just speculating but most probably to prevent unofficial firmware updates in the future.,Neutral
AMD,"I'm pretty sure Steam stats showed that as one of the most common cards out there. Probably why they're giving it the shiv, to get people to finally upgrade to newer cards.",Neutral
AMD,"I was on a RX 580 just a month ago, I wonder how many years of useless drivers I had downloaded lol",Negative
AMD,"copy/paste from another thread  *If you are lucky enough to live in a country with 5 year warranty OR if you bought your 5 or 6 series gpu card, maybe even 7900XTX with the usb-c within your country's warranty limit, go ahead and use it, this is NOT what you paid for!*",Negative
AMD,yup my 6800xt has been treating me very well,Positive
AMD,You definitely got your money out of it. The 9060XT is a pretty good upgrade.,Positive
AMD,I still have mine as a backup,Neutral
AMD,"yes, and I don't consider it is too old, I am still playing alright with it. But saying that they won't implement new feature doesn't mean that they will stop updating the drivers, no? They just stop including new technologies.",Neutral
AMD,I'm on my 6800xt. I'll have to use it for quite some years to come as I'm a student,Neutral
AMD,"Yea same, I love my 6900xt but this is quite a bummer to see. Great GPU with great performance.",Positive
AMD,"You will get game support i believe,thats maintenance, just no new features",Negative
AMD,"It always happens when a company is comfortable with its market position. Zen was priced very well as well as Zen+. Zen 2 had a small price increase but was well regarded as good value. Zen 3 and later increased price a lot and so you're just paying for the performance increase you get.  AMD was in a very weak position coming from years of GCN, so 5000 and especially 6000 series was good. Nowadays they are just copying Nvidia in product positioning with 8GB VRAM SKUs and price it at Nvidia -10%.   And cutting off GPU support early.",Neutral
AMD,"They’re still being sold too, so you’d expect to have a decent amount of life out of them.  This is a bullshit move to show you’re only providing 3 years of proper driver support from their initial release date.",Negative
AMD,Remember how much shit Nvidia got for dropping 1000 series support earlier this year? Cards that are like 9 years old? Imagine if they had dropped 3000 series support.  I can't wait to not see a single tech influencer call this out to any similar degree even though it's way worse.,Negative
AMD,"Heck, the RX6600 was still THE budget card for a lot of markets. It was that or a 3050 for a lot of people if they wanted a new card, or maybe an A580/B570.",Positive
AMD,I had a 5700xt and was planning to build a new pc soon and honestly seeing all this is dissuasing me from doing so,Negative
AMD,"I'm pissed off there's nothing wrong with my RX6950xt ... This was my first AMD card. But if they're only supporting their hardware for 3 years then I'll go back to Nvidia, that's outrageous honestly.",Negative
AMD,"My TUF 6800XT actually has been a royal pain in my ass, RMA'd twice and likely dying as it stands so kinda torn between upgrading or just throwing my 2080 Super back in...",Negative
AMD,"Bruh my friends 6900xt goes toe to toe with my 3090. This is fuckin’ bullshit, that thing should still be playing games at LEAST on 1080p medium-high in another 4-5 years from now.   Hell the 1080 TI is almost 9 years old now and still compares to budget GPUs today.",Negative
AMD,they need more money,Neutral
AMD,I can still run everything with my RX 6700XT on 1080p :(,Neutral
AMD,I bought my 6900xt in 2022 and it runs everything I play flawlessly,Positive
AMD,My 6950xt still has warranty and still is a fucking beast.   This really sucks...,Negative
AMD,"The 6-50 XTs released in october 2022 (3y) and already not supported, while nVIDIA dropped the 1080Ti (a 2017 card) only this year?  Were the drivers too good or what?  GPUs in 10 years will get 1 update on release then become obsolete right after.",Negative
AMD,"Bro, I bought my 6900XT in January... 2025",Neutral
AMD,"I bought my 6800 this year lol, but it's ok, it's only for the new games that will be released from now on. And even if it has no ""support"" you will still be able to play them, people play games on rtx1050 still......",Positive
AMD,"Same here. Man everywhere I turn there is a corporation or some politician saying ""fuck you, what you going to do about it?""  Like this in particular doesn't strike me as the biggest deal so long as the card is still usable for years to come, but it's just yet another unwanted plunge in the behind when I just want a day off from being completely fucked.",Negative
AMD,"copy/paste from another thread      *If you are lucky enough to live in a country with 5 year warranty OR if you bought your 5 or 6 series gpu card, maybe even 7900XTX with the usb-c within your country's warranty limit, go ahead and use it, this is NOT what you paid for!*",Negative
AMD,Got my 6900xt in 2022. This is such a bullshit move by AMD. Wtf.,Negative
AMD,"Last time they did this, they dropped all Vega-based GPUs, while still actively selling mobile CPUs with Vega iGPUs.  It's not like they're supporting the consoles either, the console manufacturer gets complete control over the chip there - it's Sony and Microsoft who make new optimizations for them.  EDIT: Oh, it's even worse. This drops RDNA2, so once again, an iGPU that they're putting in new mobile CPUs for next year. The ""new"" Ryzen 3s and Athlons will launch without GPU driver support from day one.",Negative
AMD,Yeah I was still hoping for it but... yeah...,Neutral
AMD,"You have like me (7900xt) the int8 FSR 4, which is a massive upgrade from FSR 3. Its easy to install with Optiscaler.",Positive
AMD,"Fsr 4 isn't even coming to the 7000 series. You can get it to work because the leaked code/software, but even then, on the 7000 is doesn't work as well as 3.1 because of the overhead.  But yeah, this situation is fucked man, they should've given way more support to these cards.",Negative
AMD,Lol exactly the same: My Rx 6700 XT is 1 year old and it is losing support same time as my 7 year old GTX 1060 6gb.   Also Bf1 randomly started crashing on my PC for no reason. Lovely stuff.,Negative
AMD,I literally just bought a 6800xt to replace my 2070.. might return it for a 7800xt.. just didn't want to spend £75 more for a card that doesn't out perform the 6800xt.,Negative
AMD,"Actually, the 1060 6GB gets support for new games like Battlefield 6 and Bloodlines 2 that the 6800 XT is NOT getting support for.",Negative
AMD,Another reason to accept Nvidia tax. At least they don't fuck you over after just 4 years like AMD,Negative
AMD,I will never understand why people downgrade to AMD.,Negative
AMD,"If you are lucky enough to live in a country with 5 year warranty OR if you bought your 5 or 6 series gpu card, maybe even 7900XTX with the usb-c within your country's warranty limit, go ahead and use it, this is NOT what you paid for!  I am lucky enough to live in a country with 5year warranty, if AMD is ending driver support to my XTX within the next 4 years i for sure know the store would have to honour a warranty claim.",Negative
AMD,>And i dont understand why this isnt getting more traction than it currently is getting  Too busy calling NVidia the devil for cutting support on their 12 year old graphic cards.,Negative
AMD,"Yup, I'm buying a Nvidia card next. I keep my PCs for too long to deal with this.",Negative
AMD,Well AMD is known to do this. They don't support their GPUs for long compared to Nvidia.,Negative
AMD,"Lol multi billion dollar company owned by the cousin of Nvidia.      ""Underdog""",Neutral
AMD,The USB C port on these graphics card causes bizarre display issues when used. Ask me how I know…,Neutral
AMD,"Sure, but the 6000 series cards aren't old at all. Nvidia is just now dropping support for 1000 series cards.",Neutral
AMD,Even the 6600 is still very popular as a budget card,Positive
AMD,The 6x50's came out in 2022 and is already being dropped   Next time im paying nvidia tax,Neutral
AMD,"The RX 5700XT was very popular. It's what brought RTG back from the grave, and made money for the development of the RX 6000 series - with which AMD's popularity peaked. That was the single out of ""modern Radeon era"", where they were actually somewhat competitive with NVIDIA. The 7000 while decent, was overshadowed again by the Green Side.   Also, this is a bad look either way. Who's to say they won't drop the 7000 series by next year?",Negative
AMD,"I love my 5700xt but I've had it for 6 years now, it's served its purpose though I wish it could get support for a bit longer.",Positive
AMD,"I have a RX 5700 XT and it's still a very capable GPU despite the lack of RT.  They didn't cut support of the RX 6000 series because the hardware was deprecated, they dropped it for no good reason.",Negative
AMD,"Whilst I agree dropping support for a 2020/21 product is bad, the AM4 platform has been one of the most widely used in history and honestly don’t see them dropping support for another couple of years.",Negative
AMD,The only reason AM4 is still going is as an outlet to get rid of extra server dies. If it didn’t make business sense they probably wouldn’t do it,Neutral
AMD,It's possible that this support has something to do with Windows 10 support as well. The timing seems rather coincidental,Neutral
AMD,"This doesn't mean new games won't start with that card, it means AMD isn't adding new features or updating the drivers to fix bugs for specific games. This doesn't instantly turn your card into ewaste.",Negative
AMD,So AMD historically has had much shorter driver support compared to Nvidia. I'm not really surprised.,Negative
AMD,The last 5000 series model has only recently passed 5 years.,Neutral
AMD,"There's no concrete timeline, but games as recent as BF6 could technically start having issues.",Negative
AMD,Realistically not until support actually ends when they stop driver updates all together. The cards have gone into maintenance for their drivers meaning they will only be receiving fixes and not new features. Games today and into the future should run fine but there might not be any game specific optimisations for small performance boosts on the latest driver version for these cards anymore.,Negative
AMD,"It just means that they won't be getting any new features in upcoming drivers. They're still supported, and driver updates will contenue for the foreseeable future.",Neutral
AMD,"Most likely 10 years. The 500 series, for which support was dropped 4 years ago still does fine in a lot of games.",Positive
AMD,Fuck amd and nvidia they both suck and both do shtty things.,Negative
AMD,Guess I'll wait until mine dies to see what upgrade comes next.,Neutral
AMD,Your GPU will continue to work just fine.,Positive
AMD,The Open-source Linux drivers will keep chugging along unaffected.,Positive
AMD,This is the actual fuck you. If they don't release an int 8 fsr4 for no real reason when I've been running it on the 6000 series that's just a massive fuck you.,Negative
AMD,People praising one corporate over another until the one they trust fucks them over too. Choosing between two evils.,Negative
AMD,this was a very surprising thread to read on r/ amdmasterrace,Neutral
AMD,It will. This article is not saying your GPU will not work with new games starting now. This is honestly a PR disaster and AMD needs to address this.,Negative
AMD,"If its running the games you want, then I wouldn't upgrade, just my opinion.",Neutral
AMD,"The RX 580 is such a champ though, played so many recent-ish games on that.",Negative
AMD,RX470 here 😂 we don’t need to but it does mean our next upgrade is cheaper now 🤷‍♂️,Neutral
AMD,"If you're on a budget, get the 5060/ti . It's a sizeable upgrade from that gpu.",Neutral
AMD,7000 series got screwed worse than any other generation... Took 2 years for FSR 3 then dropped them from future FSR versions 6 months later. AMD is a dumpster fire,Negative
AMD,I have a 5700 xt and I'm with you 💀,Neutral
AMD,"Well the drivers have been open source for a while, but only for Linux.",Positive
AMD,GCN was FineWine because it pioneered GPGPU compute features. With ACE and strong reliable GPGPU performance it keep up with the trend of more compute less pixel blending in latest games.  RDNA back paddle on that front and split from CDNA. This was a direct opposite move from GCN philosophy and this is the result of that.,Neutral
AMD,lol,Neutral
AMD,No it means that next year they will stop updating it and in 2028 they'll stop everything like on that news the bear minimum lol,Negative
AMD,"If this is a pattern, its getting axed from all updates in 2 years.",Neutral
AMD,The 6800XT was considered one of the best cards available for its generation lol,Positive
AMD,Wrong. Thats a great card and was the price performance king for months,Positive
AMD,it seems AMD cards doesn't age as well as Nvidia cards so maybe paying extra is worth it,Neutral
AMD,AMD is at its all time peak now. Dropping support is just an inevitable result for poorly developed hardware.  I predicted that this day would come when I figured out RDNA3 still missing AI matrix execution units that was already on CDNA for years.,Negative
AMD,Don’t say that. It’s just RDNA 1/2/3 were bad products that have short lifespans. GCN cards were super long lifespans and RDNA4 is also promising. You should not buy a 6700XT in 2025 when FSR4 was released and praised.,Negative
AMD,Did you even read this thread? People with AMD cards are pissed and have likely already lost them as future customers.  I got a 6800XT just 2 years ago and was expecting to keep using it for several years. Cutting support so soon is nonsensical.,Negative
AMD,"If it was Nvidia doing it, the sub would be bashing Nvidia. Since it's AMD, this is normal",Negative
AMD,That’s not what that phrase means.  Planned obsolescence would be AMD designing them to DIE at some point just outside of warranty. This is simply them not supporting the cards with newer features because they lack the hardware.,Negative
AMD,The card won't get new features or a game optimisation driver anymore just security and maintenance patches,Negative
AMD,It's great news because everyone thinks this will change something and sell them,Positive
AMD,They can’t. As those cards lacking hardware performance for matrix FMA which is a key point in AI era graphics rendering.  They will have to drop support and focus on new cards or they are dragging themselves down and wasting their new hardwares.,Negative
AMD,You shouldn’t brought a RDNA2 to begin with. A 3060 would runs faster with DLSS.  Fanboys always laugh at DLSS but when AMD dropped FSR4 they just stopped.  They knew the days for older cards are counted.,Negative
AMD,They were never doing good since RDNA1 and this is inevitable. RDNA 1/2/3 was missing important GPGPU compute features that defined GCN as FineWine. They even regressed on int8 support on RDNA1.  I always warn people this day would come when AMD have to make this difficult decision to tell them those card was in fact pretty bad and they have to live on.,Negative
AMD,At least I got 4 years,Neutral
AMD,3080 was a lot faster with DLSS. And it has hardware ray tracing while 6950 only runs them with normal shaders and texture units.  It should be a no brainer back then but thanks to AMD marketing and slow awareness of mainstream media this is the result.  Even today we still get benchmark with native resolution that nobody would use.,Neutral
AMD,Is this not a bit soon? Like maybe I’m wrong here. I’m not really that well-versed in this world of software updating but aren’t Nvidia still supporting the 20 series which came out around the time of the 5000 series if I remember correctly?,Neutral
AMD,"You got down voted, but that link has put me over the limit for sure. On to the 7000 series",Negative
AMD,"The ""New game support"" is some bunk, because in a technical sense the 6000 hasn't worked for many new games which have Ray Tracing as a requirement vs a little feature you can turn on to increase the power draw on your PSU while also making the FPS drop.",Negative
AMD,Features not game support.,Neutral
AMD,What the fuck ? All the while the current gen consoles use RDNA 2. What is going on,Negative
AMD,are you retarded. It just means its not day 0 support. Its still supported.,Neutral
AMD,there is little to gain in such mature platform  for games tho however its literally the rest that matters especially now that we know fsr 4 can work on rdna 2 it means that they will never officially bring it and im sure if they list nvidia 3xxx cards as compartible there is going to be a nuclear war,Negative
AMD,"In a vacuum, this might be fine. But AMD aren't alone in selling with GPUs.",Neutral
AMD,"Was just discussing this with a friend. Its so recent too, I'm shocked. I was reading about Nvidia updates for their 1000 series bro thats like a decade plus old no? What is AMDs reasoning here  Like these RX cards are the best value for Vram in my opinion, anything 12 or 16 gb is pushing 1000 dollars for Nvidia, but only around 400-600 for a 16 gb 6000 RX Card   Make it make sense",Negative
AMD,I don't have one but I could see it being useful for a monitor that has USB-C in using the DP mode. Single small connector with no adapters.,Neutral
AMD,"Hijacking to get this information to the most people.  If you are lucky enough to live in a country with 5 year warranty OR if you bought your 5 or 6 series gpu card, maybe even 7900XTX with the usb-c within your country's warranty limit, go ahead and use it, this is NOT what you paid for!  I am lucky enough to live in a country with 5year warranty, if AMD is ending driver support to my XTX within the next 4 years i for sure know the store would have to honour a warranty claim.",Negative
AMD,You would think this would lead to lawsuits since they are removing something people paid for.,Negative
AMD,Sooooooo non-issue for everyone except for maybe <1% of RX7900 users?,Neutral
AMD,huh. Always wondered why my 2070S FE had a usbc port but newer RTX gens didn't. That explanation makes sense.,Neutral
AMD,It was ahead of its time when unfortunately. Really sad it died.,Negative
AMD,"This actually affects me, I pass a card through to a VM and use the USB port for a USB hub for peripherals.",Neutral
AMD,kinda funny this happens right around the rumor of Valve's new VR headset being green lit,Neutral
AMD,Is it known if it also disables the USB-C port on my 6900XT?,Neutral
AMD,Why do it now that more headsets support it? It probably also works with the Bigscreen Beyonds and the Vive Focus Vision.,Neutral
AMD,"Well, it can only be disabled if you keep updating the Radeon drivers.   \*wink\* \*wink\*",Neutral
AMD,Oh shit so *thats* what that random C port was lmao,Negative
AMD,"you can't flash anything onto the GPUs via the USB-C port. it doesn't ""connect"" to GPU memory it passes through to the motherboard, and it would be useless when the GPU is powered off anyways. you'd still need a reprogrammer that physically connects to the eprom on the GPU PCB to flash unofficial BIOS if the on-board security doesn't reject it. These aren't like USB ports on TVs or your phone that let you flash new firmware.",Neutral
AMD,What a stupid decision.. highest market share product no longer supported?? Seems like a stupid gut punch to your consumer.  How do you plan to maintain market share at all,Negative
AMD,"Well, it's time to save for a new GPU...",Neutral
AMD,"This actually does the opposite effect since the customer will think that the GPUs only gets 4 years of driver update now, they will switch to Nvidia for better support and long term usage. Not to mention the 2nd hand market value will drop even further when AMD cards are already selling cheaper on 2nd hand market. AMD actually shot themselves in the foot lol.",Negative
AMD,"Looking at the Steam Hardware Survey right now, the Top 10 AMD GPUs right now are:  1. ""AMD Radeon(TM) Graphics"" (2.2%) 2. ""AMD Radeon Graphics"" (1.95%) 3. Radeon RX 6600 (0.92%) 4.

AMD,"They are pushing me to upgrade to a newer card, that's right, however after being an AMD GPU fan for so many years (simply because of cost/performance) I will finally be buying my first Nvidia GPU",Positive
AMD,"Bought mine 2 years ago and I love it, so this is really annoying. I always favored AMD over Nvidia but after this move, that may change in the future",Negative
AMD,"Still a crook move from AMD.  I've seen so many people defending AMD against Nvidia like they were for the gamers, but all in all they're here for the profit just like everyone else, and they're moving in a way they hope people will upgrade their GPUs... I wouldn't with that dick move.",Negative
AMD,"literally just bought a 6800 few months ago, pissed off.",Negative
AMD,It genuinely seems like amd is fine treating their discrete gpus as an afterthought and don't really care about increasing marketshare at all.   They already bungled the whole fake msrp thing with the 9070xt earlier this year.   Might as well just pay the extra Nvidia tax of $50-100 for your card so you know it'll at least get more than 3-4 years of driver support.,Negative
AMD,This this this. I bought a bnew 6600 like a fucking idiot 😭,Negative
AMD,"It's just that Nvidia still actively supports GTX 900 and 1000 cards. There's still gonna be a handful more gpu drivers supporting them.     But yeah, I doubt these threads will reach 1k upvotes or get any media coverage. The underdog can't possibly be held accountable for anything.",Negative
AMD,didn't you get the memo... come on everyone knows AMD is a small startup indie company. That is not only the underdog but is treated like swine by the big players. I mean Intel/Nvidia are totally out to get AMD and do everything in there power to miss treat and destroy AMD reputation every chance they get.   That is why Nvidia keeps support for there cards for so long. Not because there a good company or care about the consumers (They don't care about the consumers but that isn't the point.). They do it to make AMD look bad...   Poor AMD I hope they survive another ten years off there billions of dollars of profit. It must be hard. /s,Negative
AMD,"The double standards from the tech influencers is really disappointing. It feels like they’re too afraid to upset AMD fans to actually tell the truth.  It’s a real shame, because while AMD makes amazing CPUs, their GPU division feels like an afterthought, yet they get glazed to the high heavens. They’re quick to point out any issues or flaws with Nvidia, yet the AMD side barely gets a whisper in comparison.  What’s funny is that despite their rhetoric, most of them use Nvidia cards in their own PCs.",Negative
AMD,"From what I know, Nvidia still has not dropped the support. They will droplater next year. Unlike AMD they just gave a years notice.",Neutral
AMD,My decision between the RX 6600 XT and the A770 genuinely landed me with an Intel card that is being supported for longer. What a wacky world.,Positive
AMD,"I was about to buy an Rx 6600 when the last unit sold seconds before I got it, And I ended up with an arc A750 because a 3050 6gb was almost 50 bucks more.",Neutral
AMD,I got mine last year in February...   ![gif](giphy|qQdL532ZANbjy),Neutral
AMD,mine too. this is a brain dead move.,Negative
AMD,"And the 6750 gre came out in october 2023, so literally 2 years ago",Neutral
AMD,I got a 6700 XT last month lmao,Neutral
AMD,10 was is supported thru this month i think,Neutral
AMD,Well you will be able to play most games but I know some anticheat requirements are newer drivers and who knows if it will allow drivers that are not updated regularly.,Neutral
AMD,No New features. As in new versions of fsr or future technology. Your card will work fine with driver updates,Neutral
AMD,"there's no rtx1050, you might be thinking of the GTX 1050, which still had full support up to this month, and will keep getting security updates untill october 2028.",Negative
AMD,">*people play games on rtx1050 still......*  GTX 10 series (including the 1050) is only no longer getting game-ready drivers after October 2025, so technically the GTX 1050 from 2016 was supported by NVIDIA longer than the RX 6800.",Neutral
AMD,"but what exactly am I going to do, demand return of my money because driver support is over? I'll wait until I heard of someone actually succeeding doing it before I waste my time arguing and not getting anything of it (likely outcome)",Negative
AMD,"Yeah but I'm not going to buy another GPU when the 6900xt is perfectly fine lol...... not looking to upgrade until after the 9000 series.  Edit: oops, misread that reply",Negative
AMD,Doesn’t work in games with anti cheat though right?,Negative
AMD,"Yeah, my 6800XT is 2 years old and already loosing support, I guess I will buy Nvidia in time to play the PC port of GTA 6",Neutral
AMD,Good thing it will never be fixed now apparently!,Positive
AMD,Have a peace of mind and go with Nvidia. Go with the 5000 series gpu and pretty sure the driver support will last a good number of years.,Positive
AMD,"Well...maybe the 7000 series will be next. Looks like AMD isn't going to support their GPUs for a longer period anymore. If you want to keep your GPU for more than three years, your only option might be to go for NVidia.  I always used AMD GPUs before but now that they are going in that direction, I might switch for long term peace of mind.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, after this, I'd rather buy even Intel, at least that is affordable and they have to get competitive on the driver field. I play mostly 5+ year old games anyway but I will buy the RTX 6000 series whenever that comes out",Neutral
AMD,It won't stop functioning will it? Just wont be optimized for new games day 1. Seriously doubt it could be a warranty claim. I am in the same boat.,Negative
AMD,"If AMD gets away with this shit, what do we think Nvidia will do next? This is horrible, and people dont seem to get it",Negative
AMD,"Among other things, they're capable of fast charging. That power draw off a GPU could explain that.",Neutral
AMD,The USB C port on my RX6800 drives a couple of daisy chained displays through a simple USB-C to DP adapter.,Neutral
AMD,"My thinking was it's at least more logical for the 5700xt since it's six years old and can't play some newer forced RT games like doom dark ages (without linux workarounds).   As others pointed out the last 6000 series release was the 6750gre only two years ago, so that's way more of a kick in the dick.",Neutral
AMD,"I know the 5700xt is still usable for 1080p, but there'd at least be some logic to discontinuing drivers for it since it's 6 years old now and games with forced RT like Doom dark ages and Indiana Jones are becoming more common.   Discontinuing support for the 6000 series, where the last new gpu only came out 2 years ago is a serious dick move.   Real shame they can't have Nvidia's track record of long support.  Glad I upgraded from a 6600xt to a rtx 5070 this year.",Negative
AMD,Given how piss poor games are at release it kinda turns them into e waste,Negative
AMD,With modern game optimization... well...,Neutral
AMD,So they should stay useable for quite a while then! Good to know!,Positive
AMD,"Yes, at least in Linuxland we'll get support until the community is tired of RDNA2 (it won't for like the next 10 years) but it's still the shittiest of moves from AMD.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah it's just a shame a number of people don't realize this. This whole ""team red"" was just clever marketing. Nvidia does the same stuff. They are corporations trying to make money, not friends or teams. The only friend and team should be your wallet with whatever product has the value you desire at the time.  Still this driver support, or lack thereof, has certainly made me glad I sold my 7900 XTX.",Negative
AMD,Thanks. That makes sense.,Positive

AMD,"There’s a reason they lost pretty much all of ATIs marketshare, which at time of acquisition was around 45%+.   They never had a vision or path, just played catch up and even did that poorly, to this day.   AMD fanboys are some of the loudest but most delusional group I’ve ever seen on the internet.",Negative
AMD,6800xt is is still great mid range card apple to compete with 9070's and 5070's,Positive
AMD,"The only good thing about this gpu is it's raw performance for raster and the 16gb of VRAM buffer, everything else is mediocre at best.  - Awful RT performance - FSR2/3 is absolute garbage - It had subpar performance on DX11 and OpenGL games for more than 1.5 years until AMD decided to improve drivers",Negative
AMD,It's lack of dedicated ray tracing hardware or AI upscalers was always going to make it age worse than the competition.,Negative
AMD,And you base this on what?,Neutral
AMD,"They’re at a peak when most their consumer base is at a financial low, whereas nvidia did their shitty business practices during the Biden boom, it’s why so many have a 5090.   While the 6000 series wasn’t the best designed, they’re still pretty powerful gaming wise & with my 6950xt, I’ve been able to run everything modern maxed out (minus RT) at 4K at 144hz, the only drawback is that it’s less heat efficient so needs a window open when playing with settings maxed. Dropping it for the 7000 series is also pretty silly, as iirc the XTX has 24gb & is comparable to the 6950XT while being around $300 cheaper.   These practices could mean AMD has done a bad financial decision, they’re cutting staff or they’ve just thrown a massive investment somewhere & need to raise some quick capital. It’s most likely a mix of 1 & 3, as pre-built pc’s aren’t going to keep shipping cards which no longer have new game support, really bad news for that business sector tbh, which will lead to price increases to cover the sudden new stock costs, meaning less consumers buy them, companies buy less new stock, hurting AMD’s revenue.   It’s just such a silly decision, for something that costs peanuts compared to everything else AMD spaffs money towards",Negative
AMD,I wonder what else do I need to upgrade in case I will change to 7 or 9 series,Neutral
AMD,"Ah yeah, one of two times in the past 15 years AMD has competed with NVIDIA seriously and up to the flagship, and it's a bad product now. RX 6800 and up outperform the 9060 XT, no reason to drop support.  Also, RDNA 4 is a carbon copy of the initial release of RDNA 1, 5700 XT and 5700 | 9070 XT and 9070. 5600 XT and 5600 OEM-only | 9060 XT and 9060 OEM-only.  This is 5 year old hardware that's been sold new as recently as 2024 (which is still put into current gen mobile APUs of 2025) being delegated to security updates the same time NVIDIA is delegating Maxwell and Pascal from 2014 and 2016 to security updates.

AMD,"then dont buy amd ever again, problem solved",Negative
AMD,yes,Positive
AMD,But them literally killing a port for no reason is making it obsolete. The guy is right 100%,Negative
AMD,"It is planned obsolescence, just by a different manner/technique. What you described is the traditional way, but if a manufacturer says that we will limit X features only to products A and B, C and D will be shut out, then C and D does become obsolete because if you want those features you will be forced to upgrade.",Neutral
AMD,"You can plan for the product to fail by design or action. In this case they planned to make the cards obsolete with an update. Pro Apple move, they have sold me the last chip I will ever buy from them.",Negative
AMD,In turn intentionally making them obsolete. It's the same outcome. He's right.,Negative
AMD,"Back then and still now i didn't care for dlss or fsr, all i just wanted was rasterized performance beast as i also did not care for RT, so $100 less for a card that had similar and or better raster performance than the 3080 was a nobrainer for me at least, or well until i discover i get no more gaming drivers support for a card i bought 2.5 years ago 🙃",Negative

AMD,"Does feel early considering the hd 7970 was supported from 2012 to 2022, while never highlighted for new games after like 2016, the updates seemed to add access… to me this points to a radical shift in gpu design coming up, trying to support as few structures as possible",Neutral
AMD,It doesn't matter too much tbh. I've used drivers from years ago and have no problems. It only matters if there is a bug.,Neutral
AMD,"not really. 5000 has no RT at all, and 6000 was there first gen so its half baked. The cards will still work but they are quickly falling behind with modern standards,  also people need to learn to read. they are still getting drivers, just not game specific ones. they are both RDNA cards so they will still benefit from the drivers being released.",Negative

AMD,"Yes, very early, as the 6750 xt was released 3 years ago",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, I edited my comment to include the link. Some people can't be bothered to do even 30 seconds of double-checking, or just got offended AMD is dropping support for GPUs so fast.   The 7000 series can be good, but I'd be a bit hesitant about those as well. They don't have AI cores, which could give AMD an excuse to drop game support for them in a couple years.",Negative
AMD,"I put a 7600 last year in our kids' gaming PC, and this news makes me question that decision retroactively. A 4060 will be good for years to come (at least at 1080p) with Nvidia driver support.   What sucks is that i was looking at the Adrenaline panel and AMD's vastly improved support for drivers and felt comfortable recommending them until this news broke.",Negative
AMD,"It's not getting new game support for two games that DO NOT have RT, Battlefield 6 and Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2.   I'm the biggest critic of AMD's approach to RT and half-hearted ""enabling"" it on RDNA 2, but it can at least run it (you can get a good 60fps+ in Doom Dark Ages with some upscaling and lowered settings, even on the lowest RX 6600, for instance).

There is no requirement for a manufacturer to continue improving the product after selling it to you.",Neutral
AMD,"its a non-issue for most people but I'd still be pissed if Nvidia released an update that disabled the VL port that I paid for on my 2080Ti for seemingly no reason. this is not a good precedent if its permanent even if it doesn't affect you or most people.  If one day AMD goes ""study shows most people dont use more than two monitors, so we're releasing an update that disables all but 1 of your HDMI and 1 of your Display Ports"" would you still be fine with that since you're not personally affected?

AMD,"It’s not game support it’s feature support. Nvidia 20 series still gets latest DLSS support.   AMD slept while Nvidia laid out the ground for AI, upscaling and RT. Some of us saw this coming long ago because you can’t flip a switch and catch up YEARS of development, not in chip technology. AMD was too busy getting pats on the back from their “Raster  and native resolution only bros” meanwhile Nvidia saw the dead end road and the performance demand that software was going to require years ago. We’re seeing that now. GPUs hitting a wall and games requiring more and more raw power that isn’t there and can’t easily be made to be there.   AMD is just now getting off the ground with RDNA4/5, but that means they need to ditch prior gens because guess what, they can’t support what AMD is doing. They just have to cut their losses and stop trying to throw resources at developing new features for prior gen cards. Nvidia doesn’t have that problem because their prior gen cards support some of the feature they are putting out since the arch was being laid out from 20 series forward.   It was always worth spending $50-$100 more for those features and support. Always. Some of us have said that for years.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah looks like it given Nvidia only just dropped 10 series support for cards first released in 2017, the extra $50-100 buys you real value on longevity it seems.  AMD own goal on market share, just as they we’re getting more support from gamers",Neutral

AMD,RX6800 was around half the performance of RTX3080 with DLSS. It never compete with NVIDIA to begin with.  AMD only back to this market with FSR4 aka performant FP8 matrix FMA starting with RDNA4 RX9070 series.  Nobody wants to play games with blurry and aliasing native resolution today. DLSS/FSR4 is a must have feature.  RX9060XT runs way faster than 6800XT at similar image quality thanks to its FSR4 support. The int8 back port of FSR4 on 6800XT is basically showing you how large the performance gap is.  AMD’s marketing team was trying very hard to let people believe native resolution is the king and even sabotaging gaming releases by not allowing DLSS support in their sponsored titles. That didn’t change the fact that AI based TAAU solutions are an extremely useful feature today and AMD finally have to allocate some hardware resources for it and breaking older card compatibility.,Neutral
AMD,"Nice ninja edit. This is what you originally wrote:   > I have not, i specifically wrote this to piss people like you off",Negative
AMD,DLSS is just a part of raster performance. Just like how MSAA was part of raster performance when forward render was mainstream.  You don’t need to care about DLSS but should factor it in when comparing raster performance.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, and like I totally get the criticism and defence here. Nvidia was probably not doing a huge amount of actual optimisation or fixing for these old GPUs but they still got the occasional fix and for some reason AMMD just doesn’t want to commit to that which seems odd to me.",Negative

AMD,"Here's my thought, after 4 years hasn't AMD gotten as much performance as possible out of their architecture? I've never been on top of updates and I don't think I have ever had a problem playing a game. My current setup is 5600X on Asus B350-i Strix with a 6700XT that I managed to snag at MSRP a few years ago. To be fair the newest game i played on it was Elden Ring.",Neutral
AMD,"I would assume that maybe they’re planning on doing something with Redstone and focusing all of their work on this generation but maybe also the last generation since they got so much criticism for that. If the rumoured FSR 4 for RDNA 3 thing happens to pan out it does make sense that they would do this type of thing and focus their work on the generations that actually have the machine learning hardware to use a modern upscaler, but it’s still just a big shame.",Neutral
AMD,"They're still doing bugfixes and optimizing, just not worling with game devs pre-release on optimizing.",Neutral
AMD,"Okay, but aren’t there still some games coming out without an RT requirement? Like battlefield six doesn’t have an RT suite and is purely raster. I’m sure these players on 5000 and 6000 series cards really I would like to have bespoke optimisations for their hardware.   Yes they may be getting drivers but games specific drivers does help quite a bit, or at least small bug fixes for new games or even old games that have some sort of a small problem that the developers aren’t fixing but you can fix on a driver level. Especially if you’re using graphics cards that are in a very much clear minority compared to Nvidia.",Neutral

AMD,Oh I wouldn't dare touch the 7000 or 8000 series at this point. They have been talking about the roadmap to merging datacenter and gaming into one platform.

AMD,It's called a VirtualLink port.,Neutral
AMD,"To expand a bit to what the other person said, they're virtual-link ports that were meant for VR headsets. The plan was for the headset to just need one cable connection for data transfer and power which is the usb c port on those Gpus. Unfortunately a lot of the headset manufacturers decided to use separate cables for everything combined that with VR not taking off nearly as much as companies thought, the port is being sunset by AMD now. I believe Nvidia stopped even adding them after the 20xx series so it's hasn't been a thing on team green for a while now too.",Neutral

AMD,"Yeah, the “raster only, native only” people were insufferably smug and now they have to eat their own words.  It was obvious that physical limits on GPU tech were reaching their zenith. You can only improve things so far with native rendering, and process nodes are about as small as you can get. Graphics are already photo realistic so the easy gains are now longer there.  Now is the real time for raytracing and DLSS tech, and as you said Nvidia has been laying the proper groundwork since the 20 Series. The 30 Series saw a huge step forward, and the 40 and 50 Series have begun to perfect it, making games look and run more fantastic than ever.  I love my 4090, been using it for over 2 years and the technology it has is incredible. I don’t need to worry about it losing support next year because Nvidia actually plans ahead rather than playing tribal politics to score brownie points.  Honestly this debacle shows you why it’s important to properly plan out and develop these technologies with the future in mind. DLSS and RT are the future for graphics technology and Nvidia are miles ahead of the competition.",Neutral
AMD,Is this the one where you get massive fame stuttering as the game loads new textures?,Neutral
AMD,Ooh yeah I misread the reply.   I'm aware if the INT8 option. Just a shame they've dropped RDNA2 like this lol. I do understand it lacks the hardware but it's still a punch to the balls - i could have a 3080 back then but decided AMD because everything else i had was AMD lol.,Negative

AMD,Yeah! And it's good for Linux too lmao,Positive
AMD,No it doesn't. It computes ray intersections on the shader cores. Even RX7000 only has ray accelerators. Worse RT and only having a not great upscaler was always going to age the card.,Negative

AMD,I did not write that,Neutral
AMD,"MSAA is not part of raster performance, what do you mean? It is just an anti-aliazing tool which has its own benefits and performance costs.  DLSS is AI upscale technology, saying it counts towards raster performance is just an oxymoron. It's literally not the original image, but an upscale version of a lower resolution version.  Also on a personal note i fucking hate that even as recently as dlss 4, any game still get blurry whenever there's any amount of movement, of course is it not as noticeable as when it first came out, but it still noticeable enough to annoy the hell out of me whenever I play on a friend's computer and they have it on by default.  If they ever fix blurriness on movement fine i'll use that technology, otherwise i will never take it into account when buying a card.",Negative
AMD,Yes. AMD also supported some GPUs really long. But now they make this weird choice. I expected it to be better with more coherent series starting with RX 5000.,Negative
AMD,"> for some reason      Money. The reason is money. Not worth it for them to spend money to support the <1,000,000 people still rocking a 5000 series.",Negative
AMD,It depends on which part of the GPU stack youre looking.  In the past 7 years. The top end GPU has improved on average performance 326%. (5090 vs 2080ti)  If youre talking just RT with new much improved transformer denoiser and upscaling that hits 2000 series hard. the difference is well over 400% or 4x better.  There is a much more than negligible performance increase its just that not all parts of the GPU stack improved at the same rate.  A 2060 vs 5060 is only about 80% better and doesn't come with a massive vram boost like a 5090.  But at the same time 60 class cards have been getting cheaper each gen. Not even including inflation since the 20 series much cheaper including it.  A 2060 launched at 349$ which is 450$ today while a 5060 is 299$,Positive

AMD,"I honestly have no idea. My initial thought was that there's a problem with it, especially since they directed users to a significantly older driver version (25.3.1 from March 6th 2025). Maybe they found something in newer drivers that could cause crashes or damage? But if that's the case, I would have expected at least a brief explanation in the note (i.e. ""Disabled USB-C power deliver on RX 7900 products, due to to the risk of damage to connected devices"" or something like that.)   I really hope it's not just a decision to disable the feature because they don't want to support it anymore. But unfortunately, that seems to be their motivation for a lot of decisions, lately, like dropping RX 5000 and 6000 game support. AMD has a history of this, they dropped game support for Vega APUs a while back while they were still being actively manufactured and sold. Nvidia, on the other hand, supports their GPUs for far longer. Their latest driver still supports GTX 900 series Maxwell cards, although that's expected to end this month along with GTX 10 series support, probably with one final driver update today or tomorrow.",Negative
AMD,"""...I never used the port"" - that's the reason, right there! It was designed in the hope/expectation that VR would really take off. It didn't and they won't bother ccontinuing to support a feature that nobody uses.",Negative
AMD,"But don't you see this is a precedent for the future? It doesn't matter if it runs well rn. BF6 is already well optimized, one of the few games released this year that are. But most games have been horrendous recently. The 6000 series is now effectively obsolete if you want to play newer games.",Negative
AMD,"I mean, they're not going to brick your card so ofc you can still use it to play new games. It just won't have driver support for those games.",Negative
AMD,"This is what I was wondering. I’ve had the 6700xt for 2 years now I think, and was like oh shoot do I need to upgrade already 🙄",Neutral
AMD,For me it was back when the Oculus Rift came out people had so many problems with the USB and power delivery.  The idea of having both video and power coming from the GPU seemed like the solution we have all been needing.,Neutral
AMD,"VR Headsets tend to require power delivery, data AND display all in one cable.  Old school headsets had a thick ass cable like the HTC Vive that usually had 3 cables in one and were expensive to replace and limited by power delivery.  A single cable would have been cheaper, but even the current cables are pricy, as they were with Valve Index which blackboxed the cables into one.  Instead Meta's Quest Series of headsets basically made the requirement for cables moot as the wireless display protocols caught up quickly. While not beating the performance and the clarify of wired play, many more folks preferred it as a convenience and wire-free play for room scale experiences at the cost of requiring headsets to be standalone and have a battery making them unnecessarily heavy.  Modern Ultralight headsets like the Bigscreen Beyond are still however cabled up, but still have ""blackboxes"" that combine everything into one cable, but due to this requirement the everything out of a usb-c  port feature kinda fell on the wayside.",Neutral
AMD,I’m also Norwegian. I really don’t se komplett accepting this as a reason for return. If they do I’m returning my 7900XT and buying a 9070XT instead.,Negative
AMD,"RDNA1 already stopped working years ago on new games that require RT and mesh shaders, and if you tried to make a warranty claim because a product that never supported certain features continues to never support them I bet you would be laughed out of the store.  RDNA2 will continue to function on new games for the foreseeable future. Game-ready drivers were never necessary to run new games and in the DX12/Vulkan era their impact is negligible.",Negative
AMD,"To be fair, I think you can still use it on the 20 series which is different from what AMD is doing here.",Neutral
AMD,"AFAIK VR works better with nvidia anyways, one person i know ended up selling their 9070xt and going back to nvidia because of complications with VR and simracing",Neutral
AMD,"Eu tenho uma 6800xt, depois dessa noticia. vou ir para nvidia, nunca mais AMD. minha 6800 tem 4 anos.",Neutral
AMD,"AMD has always had a VERY loud (but smaller) fan base. It's always been like that ever since I got into PCs back in 90s and it was no different when AMD acquired ATI in 2006. In fact, I'd say it's only gotten louder when it comes to Radeon GPUs, sadly they haven't had much to show for it besides just hating on Nvidia and yelling louder. All they did was enable AMD to become complacent.  Heck just look at this sub or any PC sub here lol (or any influenreviewers on youtube, where most people here get their info from). Still as delusional as ever. There's a difference between supporting a product/company while still being critical of their poor choices and decisions...don't think AMD Radeon division saw that much, even as their market share dwindled from near 50% at acquisition to measily 6% now.  One thing I've noticed is that say 8 out of 10 people buy Nvidia... most of the time the 8 people will install their Nvidia cards and move the F on while the 2 AMD buyers feel the need to get on Reddit and tell the world about how they are now Team Red and how much Nvidia sucks. That's bassically how it's been and why real world markets don't look like Reddit PC subs.",Negative
AMD,The features supported by the rdna4 cards are more than halfway decent. FSR4 is great and the frame gen is fine if that's your thing.,Positive
AMD,"Well said.  People love shiting on Jensen and his jackets but the guy's been there since day 1 and when it comes to looking ahead and making the right calls, he's been spot on most every time. Yah he's still a corpo and runs Nvidia like a greedy corporation but you can't deny the fact that not only does he know what he's talking about (as an engineer) he knows what the F he's doing.  AMD can't even figure out how much to sell their cards for lol.",Positive
AMD,"Yes, but it never goes away. Using an older driver doesnt create the issue though.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah thats something that comes with pc gaming unfortunately, but without new drivers you may not find a fix, and only being able to really confirm after troubleshooting everything else, good times",Negative
AMD,"It still has HW RT.  It has transistors on the die that handle RT  The tensor cores don't deal with RT, it's the ""RT cores that do that""  Tensor cores deal with denoising like ray reconstruction, and DLSS",Neutral
AMD,"The thing is, most people don't like the newer frame gen. Ray tracing performance improved tangibly but that's about it. I'm talking raw raster performance. I have a 4080 and I still play with RT off when able because the performance penalty is never worth it.  4k performance on the 2060 is only like 5% worse than the 5060. 1080p performance is a starker difference but isn't that much more significant. And comparing the 2080Ti, a 1000 card to a 5090, a card you can't even get for MSRP at 2k, is odd, when it's performance difference in raster is definitely not 326%.  Ultimately my point being that the 2080 Ti especially can play anything including Cyberpunk at ultra (at 1080-1440p) at over 100fps",Negative
AMD,It will work the same as before. Maintenance mode likely just means they'll fix issues as they arise vs looking for problems or optimizations.,Neutral
AMD,thanks bro,Positive
AMD,Probably because it was designed for a standard that never got off the ground. The whole reason it’s there is for powering VR headsets but I think only a handful actually can do everything over USBC and don’t require additional hookups or power.,Neutral
AMD,"I hope i dont get jumped on for this, but i dont think AMD's GPU department are in the best position right now.

AMD,fair play,Neutral
AMD,Most of the recent games that have been poorly recieved because of performance issues have been bad on ALL GPUs. Monster Hunter Wilds is a good example. This is because they have been rushed to market rather than properly tested prior to release.,Negative
AMD,"No, you don't have to. You don't ""need"" driver optimizations specifically for every game. The AMD driver will work fine more likely than not. I've gone years before without updating graphics drivers before and still could play what I wanted.",Neutral
AMD,"7900xt have not lost anything as of yet, so no case. But if AMD is not getting enough pushback to change their decision on this moving forward, its only time before both you and me lose support, if that happens within 5 years we have a case indeed.  >I really don’t se komplett accepting this as a reason for return.  I dont see how they cant.",Negative
AMD,Its is 326%  Thats on the low end actually.   https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-2080-ti.c3305  Techpowerups performance data base uses 1080p for cards slower than the 3080.  And comparing 4k for a 2060 vs 5060 is rather dumb when both will be choked to death with vram constraints and perform the same. At 1080p the intended res the difference isn't massive still but its about 80% faster.  And cyberpunk did launch right after the 20 series launched in 2019? Or 2020. So it makes sense they'd kill that game without using RT.   using RT though. Even a 3090 at 4k doesn't give a good performance with dlss performance.   While a 5090 hits 4k 60 with rt ultra natively,Negative
AMD,"Speaking from personal experience (I have a 7900XT and a first gen oculus quest), I never used the port on my GPU, I used my case's front USB-C, and it worked fine for all of my PC VR shenanigans.",Positive
AMD,"Sure, but (a) it's still a feature that's being explicitly removed from the card with (as of yet) no explanation, and (b) USB-C power delivery is useful for many things besides VR, such as driving a small portable monitor.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, that's what the driver release notes said, it's just affecting the charging functionality. Still, no explanation given is not the way to handle this.",Negative
AMD,"Ah I thought you meant the usb c port support. If they enter legacy mode within the next 4 years it’s a win for us no doubt. That being said it’s such a dick move from AMD that id be pushed back to Nvidia, where 6+ years older gpus are still somewhat supported.",Negative
AMD,ah cool big non issue then really i guess? well for most people im sure.,Positive
AMD,I mean I’m not saying removing it is a good thing. I’ve never used the one on my card but I’ve been told they weren’t particularly stable anyway. And also it seems like a pretty rare scenario that you’re running both a high end card like a 7900 XTX and also a portable monitor so if it’s the kind of thing that already isn’t working great I can see how they might just drop support rather than spend time and money keeping it up to date. Losing features is almost always bad but I also understand the idea of pulling support for something that only exists for a very niche section of users. The classic pre-proton “why isn’t this being released on Linux” problem of if you can fit everyone who’s doing the thing into a Best Western conference room it’s probably not cost effective to continue support and not supporting it while still keeping it active on the card is selling people a product that might not be able to do the things they assume it can do. It’s kind of a “no good options” situation.,Negative
AMD,i agree with that sentiment,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah the usb c port is more of an edge case, i agree. That would be a weaker case, but losing the ability to play newer games, i really cant see how anyone could be refused a warranty case as long as its within the warranty and the consumer protection laws are on par with EU or better.  >That being said it’s such a dick move from AMD  Yeah, im actually fuming here.",Negative
AMD,Do you have a thermal limit set for the CPU in BIOS? is it downclocking because there's an 80ºC limit on the CPU?,Neutral

NimeZ/R.ID is already a start, the community will take care of these cards.  This isn't a new practice for AMD, and it wasn't uncommon for ATI back in the day either. Terascale support for instance, also dropped way too quickly, not to mention those final drivers were actually crap, unlike what AMD rolls out these days.",Negative

AMD,"I was thinking of finally making the switch to AMD, after years and years of being the “better than no GPU option”, their RT and upscaling were finally on a competitive level but after these news? They can go fuck themselves. This is like if nvidia said they were dropping support for my 3080 laptop which still runs all games out today fine.

Dropping driver support =/= them getting new features.  Nvidia, however, dropped game ready support entirely for the 10 line this month. They are only getting ""security updates."" Which is what everyone, for some reason, is thinking AMD is doing right now, probably because people, like OP, are deliberately misconstruing what they said.  The AMD cards are just not getting new features.  Yall are so over reactionary. And deliberately misconstruing what they say. They all do this, this always happens. Cards eventually stop getting new features. This is a nothing burger.  I guess being honest and true with words just doesnt get upvotes?  But get the pitchforks out I guess?  Edit: People are misunderstanding what I am trying to say. Im not comparing the 6000 and 10 series. Im comparing what happened to them driver wise. The 6000 series stopped getting new features, which is what happened to the 10 series when the 20 series dropped. The 10 series had all driver support, outside of ""security updates"" meaning no more game ready driver support AT ALL, happneded this month. People are thinking what happened to the 10 series, is whats happening to the 6000 series. It isnt. The 6000 series is still getting game ready driver support, they JUST arent getting new features.

(edit: and at a slower cycle!)  \-> This is NOT *support* worthy of a big name vendor  Such piss-poor level of software support is like coping several years with an expensive noname android phone that only got two updates and then zilch  6000 series is dead period, AMD are screwing us.

AMD,I also think it’s too soon to put RDNA2 in legacy maintenance but Amd always does this.  I remember them being even worst back with HD6870 last final driver on 4 year and half was a beta driver.  Then on middle of pandemic abandoned the R9 300 series while some R9 390 were still good enough. Open drivers in linux from community even give it newer Vulkan driver 1.3 unlike Amd abandoned it on 1.2.  Now i see Amd doing same thing with newer gen of cards.  As customer you have choice though.  If you want longer driver support and keep Amd card use linux.  Or for longer windows driver support switch to nvidia.,Negative

AMD,Right now people can buy used 6600 or 6600 XT for around $100-135 in the US on the Marketplace and considering FSR and good performance at this price it is an entry budget card at the moment because not many can go and buy new 5060 or 9060 for around $300.

AMD,You guys haven't been paying attention. They still sell brand new Polaris cards in those lost drivers support several years ago so did Vega. AMD's driver team is much smaller and doesn't have the resources to focus across multiple lines they usually drop driver support for cards much sooner than Nvidia does this is normal for them. Hardware on box has been around long enough to know this so the fact they want to behave this way just makes no sense to me unless they get upset every time.,Negative

For the build the 750W unit is more than enough. However it is worth noting that the price gap between 750W and 850W units is exceptionally small at the moment and it may be wise to just get the similarly priced 850W unit for more optionality if you choose to upgrade in the future.  > Is the B850 mobo really needed? Or is a B650 (E?) enough? I see contradictory information on that  A B650E mainboard is pretty much as futureproof as a B850 but a normal B650 does not support PCIe 5.0 GPUs.

AMD,"**Answers:**  **What do you think of the build? Is it solid or has it flaws?**   The CPU + GPU combo is rock solid. I’ve got the same setup and haven’t had a single issue running new titles on ultra settings. My 1080p monitor is the only bottleneck now 😅  **Is the PSU enough for the build (9070XT more specifically), or would a 750W PSU be OK?**   750W should technically be enough, check the GPU vendor specifications just to be safe.  **Is the B850 mobo really needed? Or is a B650 (E?) enough? I see contradictory information on that.**   I’m using the MSI B650 Plus and it works perfectly fine. Unless you need advanced PCIe 5.0 support or beefier VRMs for heavy overclocking, B650(E) should be enough.  **For the 9070XT, I mostly see Sapphire and XFX at lower prices. Are these reliable brands? Or should I prefer Gigabyte or ASRock, for example?**   I went with Sapphire—great cooling and no issues so far. If you're not into overclocking, Sapphire or XFX are solid picks. For more aggressive tuning, you might want to compare thermals and VRMs across brands.  **Do I need to buy thermal paste separately?**   I didn’t. My cooler came with pre-applied paste, and I run my CPU at 105W mode. If you’re planning to push beyond that, investing in a good thermal paste could help.  **Do I need a GPU bracket/support/holder?**   Yes—definitely recommended. The 9070XT is a heavy card, and a bracket helps prevent long-term sag or stress on the PCIe slot.  **Do I need anything else that won’t be provided with any of the components yet?**   If you’ve got a modular PSU, make sure you have all the necessary power cables. Also double-check for case screws, standoffs, and Wi-Fi antennas (if your mobo supports it).",Positive

AMD,"Thank you very much!  I was initially going for the 9600X, but seeing the price of the 9700X getting lower and lower, I just thought the extra € was worth it. It reached that price on Aliexpress (tray version) in SEP with the promo codes + shipping from a European warehouse.  Indeed, 750w and 850w PSUs seem very close in price. But I'll keep an eye on the 750w promos, in case I could save a few bucks there and invest them somewhere else in the build.  Just checked the price of B650E mobos and it seems like the price difference with the B850 is decreasing quite a bit. Looking at the prices, it seems the B850 would def be a good deal.  Noted for Sapphire and XFX!",Positive

I've read about at least 2 issues where people would use the cables from the GPU box, and it was recommended to use the cables provided with the PSU instead.  Do I understand correctly that I must use 2 PCIe (8 PIN to 6+2 PIN) cables, and only use 3 6-PIN ends, and not use the 4th 6-PIN from the 2nd cable ?  And noted regarding the other things to keep in mind! 👌",Positive
AMD,"You don't need to look into that much detail, if a PSU is rated 750W then it will definitely work.   I went for a non modular PSU so i didn't had to worry about cables.

AMD,"How is it not close? It's a 10% difference at best, usually even lower, also the last few resident evil games performed slightly better on AMD than usual so that could be the thing making up for the small gap between these 2 cards.     Also it's very likely they actually chose the GTX 1660 card as a reference for minimum settings first and then tried to find the closest AMD competitor after that which left them with no option other than 5500XT, I guess RX 590 is close too but that card is a generation older than both.",Neutral

AMD,"After thinking about this for a bit, I think I am starting to understand (not sympathize nor condone) AMD's actions here. As they spoke about in multiple keynotes, they are looking to merge datacenter and gaming into one platform. By doing this, and the fact that they aren't as big of a company (gpu wise) as Nvidia, they don't have the man power needed to support these cards in a bug fix capacity while supporting an all new hardware platform.  I mean.. Think about this for a minute. Nvidia has pretty much always had the same platform across the entire stack from 50 series all the way up to Titan/90 series. The main difference was in features either added or subtracted, but not an entirely different platform. And that's what AMD is dealing with here. They are going to be bringing out, yeah maybe a familiar but together an all new platform of video cards and it's going to take a lot of support.  Do I think AMD should have dropped bugfix support? Hell no. It's always been a thing that you support something at least a few years after it's end of sale... You can STILL buy a 6600 new... And even on Amazon, not only is it new, it's from a board partner.... It would be one thing if it was joe shmoe selling new/used or salvage or something but... You literally still can buy a 6600... Today... From a board partner's website.  That's appalling...  At first I was thinking, ok, well, no feature updates sure, but you get security updates which should contain bug fixes right?...  Noo...... This does not contain bug fixes. So if a game doesn't work with a 6600 today? It'll never work... EVER.. Maybe with Linux OSS drivers but that's still appalling to think 'meh, the fans will deal with it for free'.  I second guessed buying a 3080 multiple times when the 6800xt was cheaper and in raster, faster. The 6900 was borderline feasible compared to the price of the 3080 at times, while carrying much more vram.. I swore I would buy AMD's card of the time when it is time to walk away from my 3080... But no... I buy a video card as an investment.. An investment into time of fun, games, work, learning, etc. Not for a company to just up a few years later and go 'oh well, tough crap'..  No thanks AMD... I love your processors (and always have shout out to my AMD 486 133mhz OG folks!) but Video Card wise AMD can kick rocks.",Neutral

AMD,"I have rarely regretted any of my purchases, when it comes to my own PC. There is one exception, where due to the lack of paying attention, i bought a worse pair of RAM sticks, at a higher price than a better, cheaper one. Quickly solved it through a return/exchange. That's it!   Well, that WAS it, until i bought my first ever AMD gpu. As i wrote before, in different threads, i do love this piece of hardware. When it works properly, it shreds and i can see a sliver of hope for its future, given proper software support and implementation. Yeah, it's a power hog but fuck me, you only live once, right? Wrong. I am one of those who still has constant driver crashes, Adrenalin settings reset to their default values and whatnot. Did everything i could to make sure that there's no mistake on my end (from clean DDUs to clean Windows installs and everything that was in between). Still no luck.   Another thing that i've noticed is how rare i get a software update for the Adrenalin suite. Back with the 3080ti, i would have a new Nvidia driver almost on a weekly basis but now, if i get one in 3 months, it's a miracle. And i know i don't need them but given how many games are launched, daily, you'd expect AMD to at least try and make it look like they're putting some effort in it. Some optimization down the pipe for the sleuth of games that are being pumped out like it's Christmas Day in '89.      One of my siblings has an older 2070 that still gets more updates and trickled down features than my own GPU gets. It shouldn't be that way! The difference in price, between these 2 gpus (the 7900xtx and the 2070) is staggering but i feel like i'm the one with a lower, entry level model and she's the one with the flagship. Remember Apple? Hardware is only half of the package, software being the other half. Good, state of the art hardware is useless if the software lags behind it and that's why this is my first and last AMD gpu.",Neutral
AMD,Typical PCMR though.   top comment is a defending AMD and straight misinfo.,Neutral
AMD,AMD has actually been pretty consistently scummy since 9000 series launch.  The fact they didnt put FSR4 on 7 series is crap.  It was a move to push units.  This is all about $$.  They are also now getting big in the AI space so hold on while they become Nvidia but worse lol.,Negative

People are more or less pushed to change phones every 2-4 years. Cars every 5-10 years. Appliances somewhere in that range too.  And for what? Just because a company wants you to consume more.",Neutral
AMD,">The AMD cards are just not getting new features.  Yeah, we know, moving it to a legacy branch doesn't means it's getting no support, but less support, which is ridiculous, hence deserving of backlash. They're still dropping support for the cards, just not entirely.  I've been saying this for years that AMD has worse driver support than NVIDIA. It's not just that they drop products faster and push older ones to legacy branches, they also have worse driver feature support, even when they're still on the main branch.  Every time AMD releases a new radeon software feature, it's always locked to the newest cards, or the second newest. RSR, SAM, AFMF, RIS 2, Anti-Lag+, etc  I remember when RSR came out and NVIDIA responded with NIS for feature parity, and it worked on every GPU they still updated. AMD then claimed Anti-Lag+ couldn’t run on older cards, only to prove themselves wrong by adding support through Anti-Lag 2 in games using those same GPUs.  The reason why is because in games, AMD needs as many compatible cards as possible to convince developers to integrate their features. On the driver side, there’s no such pressure, so they use feature restrictions as a way to push upgrades.  That’s why I switched to NVIDIA. They’re just better when it comes to long-term driver and driver feature support. Getting things like RTX HDR, Video Super Resolution, DLDSR, and more on older generations is nice.",Negative

AMD,"AMD supported GCN for a *very* long time. But the way they drop support is always questionable. The HD 7000 series continued to get driver support until June 2021. That's almost 10 years of driver support since the first card released at the end of 2011. Adversely, AMD cut support for the 200 & 300/Fury series that same year - released between 2013 & 2015 respectively - less than 6 years of driver support for the latter. Meanwhile, the RX 400/Vega series do still get driver updates but at a much slower pace, and these cards released between 2016 & 2018.   AMD is very hit-or-miss with their driver support and it's honestly mind-boggling. The only reason why later-gen GCN (Polaris/Vega) receive support still is because Polaris was very popular budget option back in 2016.",Negative

Satisfactory was so totally playable on UE4. But then they listened to one group of idiots who asked them to move to UE5 because “lumen” and “nanite”. Game became borderline unplayable after the move because the whole screen will have flashing and static bursts as if the GPU is dying (it isn’t, only UE5 games has this issue on Vega cards). The solution given by AMD was to force the game to run in DirectX 11 mode, which performs exponentially worse, or turn off FSR, which causes massive frame rate issues that gives me motion sickness.

Future driver updates with **targeted game optimizations** will focus on RDNA 3 and RDNA 4 GPUs.”",Neutral
AMD,"It seems that what other new features are not supported by the cards physically.   I mean we all know that certain fuctionality have dedicated hardware to run. Probably the new features needed newer inbuild functions that both card bios and driver cant emulate or translate for the said feature.   But as long the hardware still run and the updates it still recieves dont brick it, we got nothing to worry about.   Edit:   And being not supported an issue, then why people still buy rx580 8gb and gtx 1070/1080ti in the used market? Hell even old components?   Sure it's cheat but it still works, it works.",Negative
AMD,"This...New features that require newer hardware ex. FSR 4, redstone, etc.  The 4xxx series didn't receive new feature support such as multi-frame gen and the 3k series never got frame gen support at all.

AMD,keep commenting the same thing you schizo,Neutral
AMD,"I appreciate the tip but it doesn't really help the situation. Lossless scaling doesn't have access to game data the way that DLSS or FSR do and as such, it's not preferable to use it when superior alternatives are available. My problem isn't so much that I can't use upscaling on RDNA2, it's that I can only use FSR3. Optiscaler is free and allows FSR4 to run on RDNA2/3 through the INT8 path, it's the best current solution. RDNA2 and up already support frame gen, btw.",Negative

AMD,"7000 isn't that far off either since it also lacks  the support they need going forward. They just don't want to spend time/money on supporting prior gens that aren't cross compatible with their current/future AI focused generations.  Nvidia doesn't have that problem because they've been laying th groundwork for AI features since 2018 with their 20 series, it's why they can push some of their current DLSS4 features all the way back to 7+ year old arch. AMD can't even push any of their FSR4 feautres to 1 generation old cards (7000 series), they'd have to develop and maintain a different approach or new ""comparable"" features that wouldn't be moved forward to current or future cards, no business sense in continuing to support such products apparently. Same reason they are disabling the USB-C port, underused now, no longer used in current/future products and requires continuted support....best they can do is just ditch it.  Simply put, AMD missed the bus years ago and now they're trying to catch it. Some of us were saying that they need to get on baord pronto but people were too busy knocking down AI, DLSS, RT. Apparently AMD and their fanboys thought native res and raster was where it was at, all while Nvidia saw the challenges and limits on continuing to increase the raw power needed to keep up with the ever growing demands of software/games.",Negative

AMD,"I do and I worry this legacy thing is the exact excuse AMD will pull to give RX 7000 the INT8 FSR4 officially but lock it out for us on RX 6000. After all no more feature updates is also part of this and guess what is meant to come soon? FSR Redstone, and what was leaked recently? A verison of FSR4 that works on not just RDNA3, but also 2 as long you downgraded the driver to avoid the bugs it had. But AMD has conveniently ended driver feature support just before their Q4 target for Redstone is meant to happen... funny",Negative
AMD,They were still manufacturing and selling the damned things as of the end of last year. A GPU losing support within a year is not something that's been happening since forever. You are talking utter bullshit.,Negative
AMD,"Those ""game specific"" driver updates are sometimes the difference between game running or not running at all.",Neutral
AMD,"Going into maintenance mode and only pushing security updates might as well be dropping support. Nvidia does the same thing, but for much older cards. If the hardware can handle an Nvidia feature, it gets it. I can load up a rig with a seven year old 2060 right now and get access to the latest Nvidia features outside of frame gen, and Turing is older than RDNA2 is.",Neutral

AMD,"these day 1 optimizations dont really bring too much on the table.  lots of times, i forgot to update drivers, played new games, and i didnt have any meaningful performance or stability increase. even on my nvidia cards.  day 1 optimizations are a hoax, no matter which company you go for.  as long as they still do bug fixes (which they apparently didnt announce to drop support for), its totally fine.",Negative
AMD,"No, Op is a liar.   Vega had been moved to legacy support when the UE5 update of satisfactory came out.    This is not AMD moving the 5 and 6000 to legacy support. The 5 and 6000 series will keep getting all the normal driver updates.",Neutral
AMD,"yeah, but AM4 5000 series getting new releases after this many years is kinda fucked, if you think about it  they either held back and sat on the high-bin chips and are just now selling them, or are repackaging leftovers with a slight change in clocks.",Negative
AMD,"But a verison of FSR4 that works on RDNA2 already leaked, AMD is literally withholding a valuable feature away from us because they'd rather push sales of RX 9070s and whatever.   Also 3K and 2K series still got DLSS4 upscaling and Ray Reconstruction when 50 series released this year, that's a new feature updates for many years old GPUs. Yeah shame about frame gen, people don't like Nvidia withholding those either but AMD is actually worse here because WE CAN SEE FSR4 WORKING ON RDNA2 VIA MODS, yet AMD wants to discontinue driver updates before they put it out so they don't have to. At least Nvidia gave the 3080 and even the old 2070 DLSS4",Negative

AMD,"No, but the game-ready drivers DO offer some improvements. And we've also seen that RDNA2 is able to run some sort of FSR4. Why should we miss on both of those features?",Negative

AMD,"Yes, you get barely any better performance with those updates, but there are often bugs and crashes to fix.",Negative
AMD,I got a R9 390 in 2016 (came out in 2015) and dropped support in 2021. Stuff like Sea of Thieves was 100% unplayable on it later on due to updates because it required a newer driver. Meanwhile the GTX 970 was still getting updates at the time and that came out in 2013.,Neutral
AMD,"Indeed, performance enhancements are small. However, there are numerous instances where newly released games experience frequent crashes until GPU manufacturers implement specific adjustments.

AMD,No. Neither is stopping adding new features on cards that cant really physically support them anymore! The cards are 5 YO and two generations behind.

AMD,"even without these optimisations, you should be totally fine.  even on nvidia they dont bring too many improvements, if any that can be seen by the average user or even poweruser.",Neutral
AMD,"Solid points, although it isn't exactly the same FSR 4 but pretty close and a lot better than previous versions.  The future will tell. Could be the reason they made two different drivers for different gens. I think the pitchforks are out a little early is all. Hopefully another statement and clarity can come soon.",Positive
AMD,"You seem to be carrying water for amd. It's clear what AMD is doing and this has been done before. As others pointed out, nvidia still does day 1 support for older gpus such as the rtx 2000 series.  But AMD clearly said missing out on day 1 optimization. There will be delays to the rx 5000 and 6000 series on windows.  With that, we have already seen this before and it's a case of history repeating itself. And it's clearly artifical seeing as how even older gpus work just fine in linux and get support to play titles it otherwise can't play on windows.",Neutral
AMD,idk welcome to reddit ig,Neutral
AMD,There might be a limit.   Sure RDNA2 can run some of FSR4 features but the next iteration might be too much for the RDNA2 to properly render smoothly. RDNA2 might be still be able to render it but the frame drop and/or delay might too much to be implemented.,Neutral
AMD,"Maybe on the GPU side, but there are still a lot of compromises you would have to make it you're buying an intel GPU, so they don't have much choice I guess.  And honestly the CPU division spent so long squeezing every drop they could put of the market, whilst delivering as little as possible, that it's hard to overlook that.  Edit:  If course if intel release a viable mid to high range GPU, with reliable driver support and software at a competitive price, I'd consider it.  No good choices anymore it seems",Negative
AMD,They have to keep validating it every driver update. That’s one more thing to keep checking to verify it works with what it’s supposed to and how it’s supposed to.   How often do drivers get updated for TB Ports on laptops?,Neutral

AMD,Why do you insist on deliberately misunderstanding what's going on here. Is Nvidia paying you people? (They've done that before)    As I already tried to explain but it seems I need to be more explicit:  Nvidia might still include those older GPU's in their day one drivers but they didn't invest any resources into optimizing for those older architectures. Which is how it's worked for decades already.   The only difference is that AMD is explicitly stating that.,Negative

AMD,People just have PTSD because last time AMD gpus entered this “maintenance branch”  they only got security updates and not game ready drivers for new games. Which meant some games not playing or if they play would have issues because they wanted latest driver.   Now AMD is saying they will continue with game ready driver for them. So lets see if thats true. Because if it ends up being just security drivers till they EOL them next year i would be a bit unhappy too.  I have one mini pc with integrated RX6600 and I was hoping it would have game ready drivers for longer time. Only had it for two years and sounds like it’s about to EOL soon.  While I am aware it can be used longer with W11 or possibly linux  it does suck that Amd gives up on driver support earlier than Nvidia.,Negative

""**market needs""** is very subjective and can honestly mean anything they want so we'll see what happens.   As a linux user this wouldn't really effect me, but I think people on windows should take this into account when buying amd gpus in the future. Giving anything less from full support to gpus that were released from 2020 to 2023 is unacceptable when the competition is bringing nearly every feature (except frame gen) to older cards (rtx 2000 series from 2018 and newer), and has full game support and sometimes even new features to cards from 2014 (maxwell cards and newer)",Negative
AMD,"Textbook straw man argument.  Nobody was saying games won't work on day one.  But AMD did say yesterday they wouldn't put out new features for 5000 and 6000 which includes game optimizations, so today's statement directly contradicts yesterday's.  This isn't a clarification.  Instead, it's a clear course reversal if they now truly intend to keep publishing game optimizations for 5000 and 6000, or actually obfuscation (see ""market demands"") if they don't actually intend to do so and are just giving us lip service.

You might see your games running at a performance penalty because the driver developer will not look into how to optimize older products for newer games.

I assume they know that very few people use the 5000 and 6000 series cards considering AMD’s generally sad market share and those users weren’t really going to care about a few percent lost performance that driver optimisations could deliver, but they forgot that players are perfectly happy being angry on someone else’s behalf.",Negative

AMD,"I’m in the same boat and I concur. I bought this card day one for $1200, and I haven’t even got 4 years of full driver support out of it.

AMD,"Sure, even the 7000 series doesn’t have FSR 4 (though it is rumored to come next year). Imagine if the 40 series didn’t get DLSS transformer model upscaling?  That being said, they have a legitimate technical reason for this. AMD basically bet on ML upscaling being a passing PhysX style fad and not a fundamental component of modern gaming and with the lag time in hardware they likely couldn’t get anything good going until about now.   They do have platform agnostic FSR 3 and frame generation which is laudable, but they could benefit from helping their own users a bit more.",Negative

AMD,They did?,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah that's not fucking good enough, I hate these AMD fanboys trying to claim problem solved and attacking the tech channels that originally called out AMD.

AMD,They didn't. So you.,Neutral
AMD,Well we know it works and works well on INT8 cards and they have developed it so if they don't then they are showing their true colors.   Fact is some 7000 series cards would outperform the 9000 series cards with int8 fsr4 and that'd piss off the people who bought the shiny new 9060xt and 9070xt. The 7900xt with Int8 fsr4 runs with the 9070xt easily.,Neutral
AMD,"Sorta, but nothing official yet so I wouldn't consider it as counting.",Negative
AMD,"EXACTLY, a the backtrack would be putting RX 5000 and RX 6000 onto the main driver branch again. As long it's ""maintenance"" mode support is not what it should be",Negative
AMD,I had so many problems with my 9060xt I returned it due to poor performance(i suspect driver issues) on a brand new am5 system. Got a used 6800xt that works better and is faster in every game I play.  I suspect that's why they don't want to support the older cards because they're damn near just as fast as the 9000 series crap they're peddling.,Negative

AMD,"They specifically told a news outlet that they were done doing game optimizations on RDNA2 and would only do security fixes. So no, it was not hyperbole or anything. Either they made an incorrect statement before or are clawing it back after the backlash.",Neutral
AMD,"Because that's what their fav youtuber told them. By the way, the same youtuber earlier admitted to be working by Nvidia's guidelines, hence in their extensive DLSS 4 video there's no DLAA footage, and the massive AA issues of DLSS 4 DLAA aren't even mentioned - so you're expected to buy Nvidia card, notice that pixel garbage, and then be gaslighted by HUB/Nvidia fanboys online. Sticking to leaked INT8 FSR 4 Native AA on my 2080 Ti, because it actually does remove aliasing and shimmering and doesn't break with any sort of motion.",Neutral

AMD,i dont think they have enough brain power to light a 60 watt bulb,Neutral
AMD,I always think of the GPU division as that mistake... that no one is willing to admit was made.   Thats sorta why they just throw it in a corner and let it do what ever.

AMD,"Radeon makes a ton of money in mobile and console graphics though. Every Xbox since the 360 and every PlayStation since the PS4, plus every Steam deck and most of its competitors and a ton of mobile SoC's like Samsung's Exynos line use AMD GPUs.   Part of the problem though is that Radeon division (formerly ATI) is pretty freaking small compared to Nvidia. AMD as a whole is taking on Intel and Nvidia at the same time with far less resources than either, and it makes sense right now to support the one that's winning.",Neutral

AMD,That's not very nice,Negative
AMD,Why would AMD care? They didn't manufacture the cards even if its a founders edition. Then on top of that. The manufactures can't guarantee driver upgrades. As long as the card works with current drivers people aren't entitled to updates period of any type.   We expect updates we should be entitled to updates on a 2-3 year old card. Warranty wise we aren't.,Negative

AMD,"to be blunt I agree, but AMD sorta got a reputation of blundering along as much as possible.   Guessing a lot of people don't remember this but AMD first big kick to Intel was the socket 754 and 939 processors. They took the world by storm and were some of the first mainstream x64 processors on the market. AMD was basically printing market share and money.   They took the money they made and invested it in ATI. Which was already failing and had atrocious drivers. They offered way more then ATI was worth they bought ATI for like 5.6billion when the companies revenue was only like 2.4 billion and they were seeing a profit of like 16million.   Yea AMD always been really good at putting there foot in there mouths or sinking there own ship. There have been other questionable investments and dealing. I not mistaken there was a lot of uproar about 3d now processors back in the 90's.   Basically me and I am sure others are just waiting for AMD to destroy Ryzen some how. Not because we want to see AMD do poorly but just because its what AMD does. They get something become successful then do something hyper stupid.",Neutral
AMD,"The difference is that Intel was stagnant and complacent.  Just look at the strides they have made when they went to a better process node. Intel aren’t as out of the fight as people think, but compare them to NVIDIA who are still constantly innovating and developing their technology suite it just isn’t a good comparison.   NVIDIA still make incredible GPUs only really losing out on value, but with the arguable exception of the 9070 XT most AMD cards still are just Nvidia -$50 which can be worth it for some, but DLSS 4, ray reconstruction, and multi frame generation are still better than their AMD counterparts if there even are counterparts.   Not to mention that AMD has been raising prices on CPUs and GPUs due to relying on expensive TSMC nodes with usually larger than NVIDIA dies. Radeon likely doesn’t have great margins already.   It is hard to justify losing money on graphics cards in order to grab market share that would just mean making people more mercenary about what cards they buy, so if AMD raises prices for the next generation and NVIDIA doesn’t those users switch back to NVIDIA.",Neutral

I had an FX back then, ran like a 3 legged dog in games sometimes 😫  Sure they can fuck up and blow up their love child, but my money is on them coming out with something actually worthwhile in 2 years.

AMD,I am personally hoping AMD continues on with there success and that Intel raises from the grave gets there act together.  I am sure from my post history lot of people would think hate AMD and its not the case. I just want there GPU division to be competitive.   Consumers lose when any company doesn't have competition.   Nvidia has proven that with the price of things  Intel Proved that with not only the years of laziness but also the fact they blundered so hard on design.,Neutral

AMD,"My first GPU was an AMD 9700/9800 Pro. I may have gotten a few more after that but I never turned back after my first 1060. The driver support from AMD was horrendous. I tried a 7700XT this year and still had issues with software. And now they do this... Yeah, i'll stick with my overpriced Nvidia GPU's thanks.",Negative
AMD,WHAT  They did NOT just drop my 6700XT!!!!????  I haven’t even had mine for 3 years!,Negative
AMD,Got to be honest as 7900 XTX owner feels like as soon as AMD released the 9070 xt they abandoned us. Like 7900 XTX buyer were early adopters. Took AMD whole year to fix VR perf on 7900 XTX. AMD never gave clear answer on FSR4 support for 7900 XTX. My next gpu prob not going to be from AMD.,Negative
AMD,"As someone with a 6800XT that's still going strong for me, and who is someone who doesn't update their drivers too frequently, this still saddens me. My brother has been eyeing up and new pc and I've been considering looking into one myself and the points made in this video do put me off.      I was already looking at the 9070xt vs the 5080 and while I know they're not directly comparable as AMD has already lost a little bit of favour from me with them admitting they want to stay ""mid-range"" with their flagship, this driver choice is making think team green again as my current card feels like it could go for another year or two easily.",Negative

AMD,"Its not like they are supporting new games anyway some new games have random driver timeouts like cyberpunk 2077 or the last of us part 2 was not playable without random driver timeouts on release just got fixed, thanks AMD but should be on day 1.  Or Hell Divers 2 that had issues at launch, or Dying light 2 that had RGB laser show bug outside the Radeon boost issues the game had for 1 and half year or so more or less.  As well as some unity based games having random driver timeouts on least RDNA3 due those games not handling the high clock speeds that well on stock.  They may be dropping support, but they never properly supported these gpu's to begin with and now RDNA3 we just waiting for games to be playable, by the time it gets fixed it wont matter anymore, i could not play wow for example during the entire Dragonflight expansion and wasted 200+ euros on a game and subscription that i could not play for almost entire expansion, so i am happy i can finally play it again.  Hopefully i can as well during midnight expansion which has its first beta on 11 november now.  The attitude AMD often has oh its just hardware issue 99% of the time its a driver issue and their vanguard program users unable to reproduce issues, simply due lack of information required to fix these issues, because sometimes its not easy to reproduce however for those having issues, avoiding the issue is as simple as simply not playing the game with the issue, as much that sucks.  And there is the Radeon tax you pay you only get to play what the vanguard program users like to play, you want to play that latest game that AMD has not enough users playing well tough luck and sometimes its also because NVIDIA simply makes the game unavaible until launch so AMD can only fix it as soon as its released, so NVIDIA wins by default because AMD cannot support the game to begin with at launch.     So yeah that AMD is just straight out saying they putting RDNA1/2 in Maintenaince mode not supporting the latest games really pisses me off, but its not like they doing that right now anyway even RDNA4 suffers from issues with games at launch.  But i will compliment AMD for finally working with game devs these days they been doing that for over a year or 2 now and probably longer, but they have to figure out how to do things better, because this is not acceptable.  I could litterally spend time making memes out of these driver issues and actual proof that these issues are actually real driver issues, but i do not like a burnout or work for free, which is why i rejected joining the vanguard program few times in the past, alto i have cooperated with some users figuring things out even testing things, but AMD should honestly do this them self.  But i am still avaible to do so eitherway if i am able to do that, but as some one hat has no job AMD could really do something about it and start hiring people for these type of things, so they can actually fix things rather then ignore these issues.",Negative

AMD hasn't dropped driver support for RX 5000/6000; there simply aren't any more specific game optimizations for RDNA 2/1. Therefore, your cards won't become unusable overnight.

AMD,"This approach is often referred to as **""cutting corners.""** You really can't compare AMD and Nvidia directly. If AMD truly wants to improve and be innovative, they kind of have to cut corners in some areas.  It certainly stinks for the people who own older GPUs, but I think most people won't notice a big difference. I had an RX 6950 XT myself and didn't update that card regularly. That doesn't mean other people didn't have problems, but speaking from my point of view, there isn't that big of an improvement from the Day 1 updates. At least, I didn't really notice it.  Ultimately, it's the developer's job to optimize a game. Everything on AMD's side that causes games to crash and not start will still be fixed. They'll just stop with the **Day 1 optimization** efforts.",Negative

AMD,"I am not an AMD fanboy, or have any allegiance but I am somewhat understanding of their decision.  Providing game optimization for 2+ year old, previous generation, GPU's requires a lot of work and expense.  AMD has to constantly be releasing new tech, at a ridiculous pace just to keep up.  Thus, cutting off support for ""old"" products is not unheard or, or unreasonable.  The RDNA 1 and 2 generations are nearly 5 years old.  While they did release new product within the last couple years, it was primarily for the Chinese market.  Furthermore, this announcement is likely being driven in part by game developers who are frustrated with the demand to release higher levels of game performance, and yet still capable of running on older GPU's.........Besides, is this the excuse we're all looking for to justify that next purchase?",Negative

AMD was widely praised for using 16GB of VRAM in the 6000 series specifically because it would likely allow the cards to age well as VRAM became a larger consideration, by cutting driver support to maintenance mode they've now done they exact opposite.      The bigger issue is that this may hint that RDNA2 cards will not be receiving official FSR4 support, which would be a massive blow to customers with those cards because FSR4 is a significant improvement on previous iterations of the technology and we have proof, albeit unofficial, that RDNA2 cards can support FSR4 natively and gain significant benefit from it.",Negative
AMD,"Because people are fucking stupid, and act as if their cards suddenly just blew up. Reality is, AMD cards run games fine without day 1 drivers or anything. RX 580 of yours can even run software ray tracing games like Silent Hill f.",Negative
AMD,Agreed. This is more headline catching than actual impact on PC gamers. A lot of these cards are mid at best as he pointed out.,Negative
AMD,I would get occasional crashes in some games with my Vega 64. Otherwise not that big of a deal.  But why wouldn't you get a card with better long term driver and software support if you can? I was on a Vega 64 till two weeks ago but finally jumped ship to an Nvidia 5060ti 16gb for $400.,Neutral
AMD,"For what it's worth, the Open Source side AMD very much do have a hand in it. They're the original contributor of, and continue to be by far the largest ongoing contributor to the Linux amdgpu module.  Valve also contributes quite a lot though.",Positive
AMD,On the driver page: AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition does not include support for handheld gaming devices.  Users should check with the OEM for device specific drivers.   We're users typically using these drivers on windows handhelds?,Neutral
AMD,">Valve are using open source stuff      Not just using. They write it and maintain it.      But, to be fair, Valve is also known from abandoning things they no longer care about, like Team Fortress 2.",Neutral
AMD,not handhelds... AMD still release new products with RDNA2 which makes this even more ridiculous.,Negative
AMD,"At least up to par with the competition, that is, 7 years? A new rdna2  card was released around at this time in 2024",Neutral
AMD,There were quite a lots of serious problem with drivers for 6000 recently. Many games had game breaking bugs (Last of us part 2). Using AMD card is not like using my previous Nvidia card and this change doesn't convince me its about to change tbh.,Negative
AMD,but I like snake oil  no seriously calm down people,Negative
AMD,"This is the real problem.  In a vacuum, maybe it's just a bad look and AMD could get away with it.  But trailing a distant 2nd in the market, supposedly trying to gain market share, AMD absolutely cannot burn customer goodwill like this.  If Nvidia didn't use those cursed power connectors, I'd consider them too.  I feel dirty even saying that, but this is what happens when a company shows such disregard for its existing customers.",Negative

AMD,I'm seeing a higher price on 3080s 10GB around here than 6800XTs. It's not a huge difference but it's there. The 3080 also lacks VRAM so currently it's worth a lot less imo.,Neutral
AMD,"I bought a 7800XT for only 480CAD used the other day. A 4070S would have been at least another couple hundred bucks (although I doubt that’s are any for sale), and a 3090 would have been even more. I’ll be able to game on this thing for <100 bucks/year after I flip it for a 9070XT in a year or two; not sure who’s buying Nvidia at those prices lol.",Neutral
AMD,Nvidia GPU's always held their value. Not surprisingly when even a Nvidia card from 2018 has better features than AMD cards 6 years newer...,Positive
AMD,"That's up to you , it launched in 2025 , by this standard and showed  it won't get good driver updates from 2029 or 2030 on anymore.",Negative
AMD,I’m sorry this is cope. The RTX 20 Series from 2018 has all of the latest features it can actually support architecturally (other than FG) as well as game ready optimisations,Neutral
AMD,they added new feature to 20 series last year like rtx video and all the latest dlss 4.0 upscaling features are all supported on these cards from 2018. It is just false.,Negative
AMD,"That’s not the point, Nvidia’s Maxwell GPUs from 2014 still get day-one Game Ready drivers included in the same package as the latest Nvidia GPUs, while AMD cards that are only four years old and still being sold new have already lost that support.",Neutral
AMD,Nvidia supports stuff way longer. And their drivers are higher quality even now in their state they usually don't have texture or shader issues which need a day 1 fix.,Positive
AMD,> Just consider also that NVidia does exactly the same thing just silently.  Yeah I'm gonna need some receipts here chief.,Neutral
AMD,"If your GPU is few generations old you're more likely to fuck shit up by updating drivers than improve anything.  People who think that there are actually any optimalizations for old architectures besides checking the checkbox that driver is compatible with said GPU are delusional. Might help by accident if some improvements for new generation also happened to help the old one, lol.  The Battlefield 6 compatible driver caused the Adrenaline to recognize the game as Elder Scrolls Online, fucking lol. Previously I was on 25.8.1 and it was fine.   That's literally the only change between 25.8.1 and 25.10.2 i've noticed and due to that Elder Scroll bullshit I actually regret updating. Should've stayed on old driver.  To be fair I don't know if anything changed performance wise since I didn't actually do any benchmarks since I can't be bothered.",Negative
AMD,"Some games need driver updates. I keep my drivers updated, so it's never an issue for me. But my partner doesn't do that, and had multiple issues last few years where a new game didn't work properly. And where ""did you remember to update the video driver"" was the fix.",Negative
AMD,"A card being cheaper is not an excuse for less driver support. NVIDIA, AMD and Intel should support their cards for at least 6 years. NVIDIA only dropped support for GTX 700/900/1000 series this month, which is actually quite impressive.  They are generally cheaper because they are generally slower. It is just the truth. DLSS (especially Transformer vs. CNN) is superior to FSR, NVIDIA GPUs are generally faster, greater software support, etc. AMDs only major benefit if I recall is greater memory capacity.  AMD and Intel to their credit generally crush NVIDIA with more generous memory capacity. Unless you buy a \*\*90 card, NVIDIA want your card to struggle within two-three generations (so 4-5 years).  I truly want to see a compelling AMD GPU that I want to buy immediately, but I haven't seen one since the RX 480 (and I already had a GTX 970), at least for my requirements. I usually already have an NVIDIA equivalent by the time AMD announce it a year or two later.",Positive
AMD,"Me too, already put my 7600 for sale to get a 4060 ti instead",Neutral
AMD,Nvidia hardly respects gamers either. They would throw us all under the bus to sell more AI chips to enterprise tomorrow if it was as simply as flicking a switch.  Currently the state of the GPU market if you want to at least try to do the right thing is picking the least worst option whoever that is for you. None of them are loyal to us.,Negative
AMD,"Evil is still evil.   I just bought a 9070XT knowing what AMD did and I don't care, it's the best upgrade I could get for the amount I paid.  I paid 730$ for it, a 5070 Ti here costs around 900$ for the base models.   No way in hell is virtually same performance worth 160$ more. DLSS4 is tempting, but not for 160$.",Negative
AMD,"I lost count of games I have preordered, crashing due to documented AMD driver issues. FSR4 not available for RDNA3 made me sell my XTX and finally switch to Nvidia.  And I enjoyed my XTX, despite the insane heat and power draw required to match a 4080S in performance. While sucking at RT, No Upscaling, No Reflex, broken DSC implementation and the list goes on. Adrenaline would crash on startup on fresh windows installs for months, until they \*finally\* fixed it. Their overlay crashing Helldivers entirely, games not detected, settings not applying on reboot.  R9 270, RX 480, 6950 XT, 7900 XTX. Not even one of these cards did not not have issues. And not like Nivida, oh the grass won't display well in that one game. No, 23.10.1, 23.10.2 and even 23.11.1 broke Hardware Acceleration completely. Edge, Steam and Discord in foreground would freeze the entire PC for seconds.  And I kept it all clean, updated, Windows, BIOSes, you name it. Meanwhile the 5070 Ti I got as a replacement has been no less than flawless. I work 6 days on 7, I have no time to waste on troubleshooting due to their incompetence, not even once a week.",Negative
AMD,"You forgot the fact that they paper launched their cards up until the 5060 and had the gall to allow Asus to make a US$10000 solid gold 5090. Honestly if anyone were to flaunt that card in front of me they’d be in for a fucking black eye. I don’t even want the card, but the thought of it existing enrages me.  Also I have completely dumped windows for Linux now (mostly pertaining to how I cannot control windows update when it comes to drivers, it seems to ignore everything I throw at it short of a group policy, even now I can’t do that because Microsoft disabled my pro key over the petty reason that they no longer allow upgrades from windows 7, 8 and 10 to 11. Never mind that the key has been used to upgrade to 10 and later 11 before and therefore should remain valid. And guess what? AMD cards are not only flawless but works better with Linux (RT support for Vega and Polaris by repurposing the compute cores? Yes please!)",Negative
AMD,Physx is legacy tech.,Neutral
AMD,"I find that kind of argument always a bit weird          If you look at the Linux market share on  steam you will see a higher percentage than for a GPU like 9070 XT, RTX 5090 (0.29% last time I checked) and a lot more yet talking about those isn't a problem",Negative
AMD,"Linux market share, according to Valve, is around 2.7%. Macs are about 1.8%.",Neutral
AMD,"I see more people moving to Linux distros like nobara and bazzite, with Microsofts force-feeding windows 11 shenanigans the past months.   Personally, the only thing I didn't get working yet is steamVR. Other than that I have no need for windows, at all.",Neutral
AMD,About to be in that % hence why I bought AMD cards recently for that exact reason. Will maintain copies of Windows for when needed.,Negative
AMD,well here the difference is more like 250-300€,Neutral
AMD,"Yes I saw that, it probably does means that they wont get game specific drivers but it doesn't *explicitly* say that. It says they will focus on RDNA 3 and 4, but that doesn't mean they wont get them at all, it just might be later. That's why I'm saying it might've been better to wait and get **clarification** before dropping a video that will rile people up without knowing for a certainty.",Neutral
AMD,Day 1 drivers are mostly marketing but they do occasionally fix bugs in the game that you will encounter without them.   It’s not a big deal though.,Neutral
AMD,"And still, RDNA 2 will still get updated driver but probably not as frequently.   I think that once UDNA/RDNA5 comes, people will mostly forget about RDNA2 regardless.",Neutral
AMD,"It doesn't matter. It is much easier, from now on.  Does a GPU have AI capabilities? Yes = full support, No = half support.   (I am talking about FP8 or better. Not just INT8)",Positive
AMD,That global decision is from now on.   AMD and Nvidia doing it basically at the same time.,Neutral
AMD,GTX900 1000 so call support are just bug fix,Negative
AMD,"Nvidia doesn't do this for their 3000 series, I think the 900s had 9 years of support or something like that",Neutral
AMD,Agreed. And they’re even worse.   I have a motherboard with an Nvidia chipset that can never work on windows 10. Installing win10 causes the board to try to install two separate GeForce drivers side by side until the registry becomes corrupted.,Negative
AMD,It's in maintaince mode. So no day 1 or day 1000 games optimisation. Please learn the meaning of maintaince. Only security and bug fix.   So stop spreading misinformation,Negative
AMD,No day one optimizations no new features. That's cutting support,Neutral
AMD,"They didn't reverse anything, it was right in the release documentation.  HUB lied and made rage bait headlines for revenue.  This isn't the first time this has happened.",Negative
AMD,Not saying anyone is right or wrong here but when was the last time someone absolutely needed the game ready driver for a game to work at all.   Battlefield 6 just dropped and you can play it with almost any driver in the last 12 months and still get the expected performance based on benchmarks. The scope of dropping these optimizations for older cards doesn't seem as outrageous as it would be on Nvidia where games frequently have severe bugs or don't work without the Day One driver update (EX: Final Fantasy 16 on Nvidia).  I do forsee a problem though where if RDNA1 and 2 do not receive updates on a regular basis they might get gated out of launching a game with astonishingly lazy driver detection (like Warzone).,Neutral

AMD,"They didn't walk back anything.  This is what happens when you listen to techtubers and randoms on the internet.  until you all understand this below there is no point.  Maintenance mode implies ""No new features"" not ""No support"".",Negative
AMD,"Because they're still releasing driver updates, just not giving them day-1 performance patches (which might I add, is almost always a failure of optimisation on the developers part). They will still get driver updates.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm on 2080 Ti, and using FSR 4 Native AA. Somehow this youtuber didn't mention that DLSS 4 is completely broken in DLAA mode.",Negative

Ryzen mobile 7840HX and 7940HX both released in January 2024, both also have RDNA2 based GPUs.  You should be judging these decisions based on the LAST product release in the generation, not the first.

Not a fan of the 12vhpwr connector nor NVidia's power design for the 5090, but it's extremely rare that they fail.  And indeed it doesn't happen on any of their lower powered cards at all. People just love being sensationalist.",Negative
AMD,I'm assuming you didn't try to do any GPU based work. I was literally forced to use the cheap college lab Nvidia cards because AMD cards are so useless at anything except video games. And somehow they're still worse for gaming unless you're on a budget.,Negative
AMD,"hehehe, I wasn't baiting  I can see the issue with new releases. we're talking of losing bit of performance in new AAA games.  but people here are reacting as if their cards will suddenly implode into the nothingness, or if existing optimizations will stop working.",Negative
AMD,Crashing or not playing would be a bug and continue to get addressed as it was said. I think people are reading too much into this.  Its mostly about minor perf improvements and feature support which the older cards cant do or at least not do well like AI.,Negative

AMD,They weren't involved in vulkan driver though.,Neutral
AMD,"Check with OEM.....  Feels like a ""eat a bag of dicks"" comment from AMD lol. But yeah the vendor usually provides the drivers for handhelds, at least from my experience.   Presumably the OEM gets drivers from AMD and then customises for their devices so if AMD aren't going to do any updates we might as well get told to get fucked.   Advanced Marketing Disasters, lol.",Negative
AMD,"Yea no OEM is providing the level of support that AMD was themselves. As a follower of the PC handhelds since GPD's first launch in 2016, watching AMD move into this scene was like a drunk bull in a china shop.  OEMs do not want to write drivers for your hardware, they make little profit as is per machine, and long term support is not in their best interest. You will get a few drivers throughout the year if you are lucky, but their support is not going to be on the level of what AMD could provide. When the 780m came out from AMD, i was an early adopter in the form of the GPD Win Max 2 and many of the smaller OEMs had to battle AMD to start maintaining their drivers for their product as they did try and rug pull everyone with that ""OEM maintains drivers"" for a product none of them had architectural knowledge of. Over a few short months AMD took over maintaining them which was good, and its laughable their GPU side even considered releasing a product like that considering the demographics they were aiming for.",Negative
AMD,TF2 is almost 20 years old. It's hardly an apt comparison.,Neutral

Or let say if you play game as a service (fortnite, warzone, war thunder etc.) and let say two years down the line they have big overhaul to the engine, a game you played and enjoyed with no issue with your current GPU might not work well all of a sudden, even though it still has the capability to run the game well.",Neutral
AMD,"We do know, because the whole premise is nonsense. AMD doesn't have cashflow issues, they don't need to cut corners.

Also, what support for what card, up till they ended support are you talking about?  If it's the VEGA 56/64 driver support had very few problems over all.  You just had to turn off fast start up to avoid windows BS from screwing stuff up.  Most problems people had where user error.  Of course we are in a generation where people want to blame everything else. Heck my Vega 64 is still running strong in my granddaughter's computer.  She's happily playing sims 4 and other games with no issues.",Neutral
AMD,"Also means any bugs or visuals in the game due to AMD’s existing drivers.   But like I said, there isn’t much else you lose. The old GPUs work but new games may be hit or miss. I think people are just angry that this is a product AMD sold as recently as 2 years ago with refreshes and that it is now effectively just dead for optimizations and game bug fixes.",Negative
AMD,"It's more than that. Example: I have a Vega 56, so I am on the same maintenance driver branch as your RX580. I could not play the BF6 beta - the client flagged my GPU as having an old driver version. Now, I don't know if that changes for the retail release - BF6 system requirements list RDNA 1 GPUs as being compatible, but now they're only going to get maintenance releases and they won't be on the current driver branch either. My point though is that ""optimizations"" is understating what is happening for being able to play new games at all",Negative
AMD,"Theres a lot of problems. For one, if there's a game where it refuses to start on older drivers (which is more common than you think), it means you're effectively SOL on playing that game. This is especially bad on RDNA2 iGPUs like the 680m (and apparently even the 780m is affected by this which means new game support is going to be unoptimized as shit on Windows handhelds) which can be touchy at playing some of the newest games without the latest drivers.",Negative
AMD,"> so you're effectively losing a bit of performance in new games. what else?  Imagine you're buying a new GPU by observing the FPS benchmarks for *Game #1*. And then the sequel called *Game #2* comes out but your GPU performs weaker than it should, not because it lacks raw power but because AMD or Nvidia simply did not prep the driver to fully utilize your GPU.  If we're talking about an older card, I kind of get it. If we're talking about a 2-4 year old card like the RX6000 series, I think that's a huge blunder.",Negative

AMD,"For what it's worth, Nvidia was doing real driver optimizations for Pascal for a **long** time (see Alan Wake 2), far longer than AMD could have been bothered for GCN 3, for example (don't get me started on my experience with my Fury X). Mainstream RDNA 2 support being dropped when there's **a lot** of laptops being sold right now with RDNA 2 is ridiculous.

AMD,It has not even been five years since they launched the 6900XT for $999 🤦‍♂️  Nvidia can support the ancient GTX 10XX series for some nine years with day one drivers but AMD can't even support the 60XX series for five years. Certainly helps drive the gpu business into the ground. When Lisa Su became CEO AMD had 25-30% of the dgpu market and these days  more like 5% if they are lucky.,Negative

AMD,Things like the steamdeck are RDNA 2 as well,Neutral
AMD,"Overwatch 2 does shader compilation every time you launch the game for the first five minutes or so on Radeon cards. After that it should run fine. If it doesn't, check if it somehow switched to the much less performant DX12 API in the game.",Neutral
AMD,Same. Was perfect before this.,Positive
AMD,"It's being updated but stuff like day 1 support for games would be delayed and they would focus on RDNA 3 AND 4 first, but it would be still be updated.",Neutral
AMD,"Optimizations I can understand because there are architectural differences in the hardware from each vendor. There are cases where things take different amounts of time or resources depending on the hardware. And each vendor wants the best FPS number in the day one reviews for AAA games.  But how do glitches occur if the software is written according to the API standards, and how is it AMD's responsibility to fix them if the software is glitchy because it didn't follow the standards?

AMD,Do you have a ram issue?,Neutral
AMD,"Just to clarify, Linux drivers are a separate ecosystem from Windows. RDNA2 cards get feature updates and optimizations through AMDGPU/Radv/Mesa (although recently radv and mesa combined) independent of Windows ‘Game Ready’/maintenance mode. Even the Steam Deck will keep getting Vulkan/driver improvements. So ‘maintenance mode’ on Windows doesn’t mean Linux support is frozen, the open source stack evolves on a different schedule and often keeps older cards performant for years. i.e the HD 7000 (from 2012) series is still receiving game patches on linux.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, on my previous cpu (ryzen 5 3500x) I had like no fps in the first 5 minutes, but since I upgraded to ryzen 7 5700x, it takes no time to load the shaders and I can play with 300+ fps. Now after this driver update it's around 150, and doesn't improve, not even after 30 minutes. But I will check again later today.  To be honest I had a lot of issues with this gpu and I'm really fed up with it. Thinking about switching to nvidia.",Negative
AMD,"Mine is actually crashing my pc on wake(just monitor shutting off). I even reverted to the previous driver and I am still having issues, multiple DDU as well. Absolutely no problems prior.",Negative
AMD,Games are built with the generic APIs and hardware agnosticism in mind. A hardware vendor like AMD can always look at its driver to see if it can improve its interaction with the game to get additional performance out of it or if the game's implementation is conflicting somehow with the driver then see if it can be improved. In the vast majority of cases this doesn't result in big improvements but there have been cases in the past where driver patches greatly improved the performance or reliability of a game.,Neutral

AMD,"Yes, but that's been an extremely low bar considering how broken Nvidia's were (AMD has been seesawing between terrible and fine depending on generation, with RDNA 1 and 3 having major issues, and RDNA 2 and 4 generally being fine).  Your timing is also kinda bad seeing how 25.10.2 is causing hard crashes and reboots due to driver issues with 9070XTs when computers are left idle.",Negative
AMD,Irrelevant if they only last 3 years before entering maintenance mode...  Edit: Clearly this didn't land as the joke it was intended to be following the controversy earlier. I will take my leave.,Negative
AMD,"I mean things definitely aren’t ideal. NVIDIA’s drivers have been dog shit all year long as well.

AMD,Well i am for sure happy with my 9070xt. Does its work for less bucks than nvidia,Positive
AMD,"There isn't any more ""full support"" left to do. These cards are fully optimized and operating near theoretical performance peaks.  For 2027 games the difference between ""full support"" and ""maintenance support"" will be 0 FPS.  For 2029 AAA games, RDNA2 GPUs aren't going to be able to reach acceptable frame rates regardless of full support or not, because they lack the required hardware for the level of raytracing and upscaling that the games will have as minimum requirements.  Whether or not this was done this year, next year, or in 2027 is just optics, it doesn't chance anything.   There hasn't even been much optimization done in the last year anyway, so they've basically been in defacto maintenance mode.",Negative
AMD,"I can't explain in a more simplified way.  Nvidia started with AI GPUs earlier, thus more AI GPUs left to support.  AMD started late with AI GPUs, thus only RDNA 3 or better, to support.  It is a global decision made by both Nvidia and AMD. It just happened recently, they decided to do it in 2025.   Nvidia did it in July 2025, AMD did it now.",Neutral
AMD,"I'll play devil's advocate for a bit.  Nvidia is 13x bigger than AMD, and is almost exclusively focused on GPUs. Yes they do some CPU work (it's mostly ARM chips) and some networking (high GBe NICs), but their core is exclusively compute.  Meanwhile AMD is so much smaller, and their money is split between CPU and GPU divisions; with the CPU side being much healthier financially.  Not defending AMD's move here, but it's a miracle they're even competing at all - anywhere - with Nvidia, given the orders of magnitude less resources they have.   It *LITTERALLY* is David vs Goliath in terms of resources available to get shit done. Hope this at least puts things into context.   TL;DR: Which is why I don't think comparing to Nvidia is fair.",Neutral
AMD,"No. FP4 support is for 5000 series only. They could say that they're not supporting 4000 series anymore for new features.  Well, no, they just aren't phrasing it that way because it would drive away customers.  Meanwhile, AMD casually drops that shit.",Negative
AMD,"Does nvidia specify which gpu are not on there priority list? The problem is AMD announced they are just not putting RDNA 1 AND 2 on there 1 day support anymore but they are still supporting the drivers, Did nvidia do that?  Nope it's a problem with AMD release note that broke it that way.",Negative
AMD,"Thing is my plan was to continue using it for a long while, I knew support would decline *eventually…* but only after *two years* of owning a card that only released a year before I bought it? It’s inexcusable regardless of anything.  As I said in a different comment, there is always something new: Power, VRAM, Raytracing, and now AI.  It’s simply not an excuse.",Negative
AMD,half/slower support...,Negative
AMD,"Yeah it's becoming harder and harder to sell with each passing second as the news go out.  Other than that maybe one of the 13 people that use linux might buy it lol, it'll be supported there",Neutral
AMD,"I don’t think they did? The correction is pointing out that it wasn’t changed and the patch notes were just incorrect.   Maybe it was something that was supposed to go out but got pulled cause someone was like, this is pointless it’s a tiny portion of cards and the code isn’t doing anything bad but never got removed from patch notes. Happens sometimes",Negative
AMD,Oh is this a known issue now? I’ve been having this for a long time now,Neutral
AMD,"is it? If the drivers are good, games work, performance is good, is truly such a travesty?",Positive
AMD,"C'mon, it's mostly 4-6.25 year old GPUs.  Only a handful of 3 year old ones, which would have the same level of high optimizations anyway.  There just isn't much more work to do here, there is basically zero value for game-specific optimization at this point. And if there is a significant issue, we will see a patch for it for at least the next 2 years.  The industry is undergoing a technology transition and RDNA2 is going to be left in the dust for next-gen games, but Nvidia's 20XX series was farther along on the required hardware.",Negative
AMD,"NVIDIA drivers have certainly been pretty sub-par this year. I now and again get a black screen on one monitor (I believe it is related to a VRR bug) in a certain game, only for it to instantly turn back on.   Toggling HDR in Windows sometimes makes both monitors go black, only fix is a reboot.   And I'm on 40 series, and it didn't become an issue until the 50 series launched lol.",Negative
AMD,"Sure, but just feels like the PS5 has barely gotten off the ground and it is on its 5th year already. Very few games that stand out in comparison to the previous genration, no wow factor at all.  Kinda feels the same going from GCN to RDNA. Sure it is better, but it hasn’t enabled for new gameplay concepts that would not be possible on GCN.",Negative
AMD,">Does your GPU have FP8 or better(AI/ML) capability?   Yes = Full support, No = half support.  and  >It is a global decision made by both Nvidia and AMD. It just happened recently, they decided to do it in 2025.   Nvidia did it in July 2025, AMD did it now.    This has nothing to do with Nvidia and Nvidia made no such decision. They still support all RTX generation back to the 20 series which doesn't support FP8 at all. The ""AI specific"" formats introduced and supported are:  30 Series (Ampere) = BF16   40 Series (Ada) = FP8   50 Series (Blackwell) = FP4  Nvidia announced the ending of support for Pascal and Maxwell GPUs, but the first ""game Ready"" driver missing support for those is still not out.",Neutral

How is any of that equivalent to AMD screwing over R9 Fury X, Radeon VII, VEGA iGPU, and now RDNA 2 handheld owners with at best 1/2 the driver support of their main competition?",Negative
AMD,"It may be David vs Goliath, but from the customer's prespective, that doesn't really matter. AMD was the ""FineWine"" buy. Seems to no longer be the case, which makes AMD seem less apealing than they were before.",Neutral
AMD,"This argument would maybe make sense if Intel, the complete newcomer to dGPUs, hasn't been regularly rolling out updates to Arc multiple times a month since 2022, and their iGPUs have been supported since forever. I think their older iGPU driver branch STILL gets updated.",Neutral
AMD,"To counter though whether they want to or not they have to compete with what’s in the market. The issue is investment into the team.   Profits arent good? Why? It’s because they aren’t competing well against nvidia? Ok let’s make another product to compete and add more resources.   They shouldn’t be letting the team be that small due to profit margins. That would lead to a bad cycle of releases lacking support.  I will say the 9070 xt is awesome though and I have one, but the driver support definitely has room for improvement even on their newest card. If they want to stay in the market they need to grow not stagnate with same size team and stop showing to investors every 5 seconds, but that is wishful thinking for any company perhaps doh.",Negative
AMD,"Let me put it into customer context: there is no point in AMD doing GPUs, they just have zero benefit compared to Nvidia. AMD just seems almost glad for that to happen",Negative
AMD,"AMD is smaller, but not as you make out. From a quick Google search, AMD stands at around 28,000 employees, NVIDIA 40,000.  Yes, I admit, NVIDIA probably have far more dedicated to their GPU division than AMD, but AMD is still a massive company.   You HAVE to compare AMD to NVIDIA because they are direct competitors. This isn't a fantasy world, they are competition. You can't let shit slide because the competitor is so much bigger. I wouldn't buy an AMD GPU as it stands because of many reasons, but this driver support stuff sure as hell convinces me I won't.",Neutral

AMD,"OK I didn't explain myself properly. I was talking about specific hardware in GPUs.   There is a reason they switched naming from GTX to RTX, for example Tensor cores. All actual ML features released for RTX20+.   The only ""weird bird"" is the GTX 16 which is based on Turing but lacks Tensor cores, I guess it was just lucky enough to stay the course, unintentional ""support"".

AMD,Nah I am a firefighter.,Neutral
AMD,"> The GTX 750ti is running October 2025 game ready drivers 11yrs later.  Yeah, but how many fixes / optimisations for games are actually being commited into those drivers for that gen of cards?  Not defending AMD here but ""support"" is a really wooly term.",Neutral
AMD,Lol you think a 750ti with only 2Gb of ram is getting day 1 game ready drivers for something like bl4 or bf6? Would you like a cantilever or suspension?,Neutral
AMD,"Just because it's a Game Ready Driver, doesn't mean that GPU is receiving a single line of code for any games.  Those cards have likely not received any significant optimization for like 7 years and probably zero optimization for 5 years and are likely just checked for bugs and security on modern OSes, aka ""Maintenance Mode"".  The only reason they're finally being deprecated now is that they won't be able to run the next waves of games because that will require tensor cores or equivalent.",Negative
AMD,"GTX 750TI longer support, because it is based on Maxwell(GTX 900 series).  And for example GTX 16 is a Turing based GPU just like RTX 20 but lacks Tensor cores(hence the naming GTX vs RTX), it falls right in between and was lucky to stay the course thanks to RTX20, sooner or later Turing full support will be dropped too(I bet GTX 16 will be sooner).

FP8 is a number format and not something you use to describe hardware components.  >There is a reason they switched naming from GTX to RTX, for example Tensor cores.

Yes, the older, ""pre-RTX"" cards is what they are dropping support for, specifically the Pascal (2016) and Maxwell (2014) range. It has nothing to do with FP8 format support. The Turing (2018) cards (RTX 20 Series) don't support any of the specific ""AI"" formats (BF16, FP8, FP4) and still have support.",Neutral
AMD,"There is *always* something new, first it was just raw power, then ray tracing, VRAM, and AI. That don’t excuse premature software depreciation.",Neutral
AMD,"I'd bet there have been 0 optimizations applied for the GTX 750 Ti in the last 5 years.  And I mean, that thing is way below the minimum requirements for games that you'd need to write optimized code for anyway, so it's a bit ridiculous it's even listed as ""supported"".",Negative
AMD,"Of course the 2GB card isn't going to be able to play BF6, but the GTX 980ti 6GB based on the same architecture and below game min specs can sure do 1080p60fps low settings with FSR-Q or 70-75fps with FSR-B. The main concern here is how CPU intensive it might be while paired with an equally old CPU.  https://youtu.be/wF0bG3LmGRA  .....  BL4 barely runs on an RTX 3060 12GB at 1080p. Day 1 patches for older/slower hardware won't change that fact that the game runs like ass.",Neutral
AMD,"I mean, you aren't getting any meaningful game optimizations on a fucking iGPU of all things.",Negative
AMD,"No, Intel stopped supporting their old iGPUs a while ago. They just recently ended active support for 11th-14th gen iGPUs (1st gen Xe iGPUs), which are only 2-4 years old (and 14th gen is still very popular for laptops and desktops).",Neutral
AMD,Right but my point is also they should add more resources to the team which in theory could be utilized for driver support and try to work more with RDNA 2 vs tossing it to a separate release branch and also resources for better GPU support with new stuff as well. So fix the driver support team in general is what I mean.   Whether they like it or not this act looks bad compared to the competition. So we can’t be too fair to them with team size vs Nvidia. AMD should fix that problem not stick with it and just have a smaller team.,Neutral

AMD,Welp time to move to Linux since I cannot afford to move out of my RX 6700 XT. Good job AMD!,Positive
AMD,"BF6 already feels smoother! Before I was still getting 120 fps ( locked I don't want or need the extra frames, can't hit a consistent 130 anyway) but it didn't FEEL like I was getting anything more than 100.  Now it actually feels and looks like 120 fps with the added bonus of reduced to almost non-existent stuttering and micro-freezing. I think I gained a few extra frames as well but still can't hit a solid 130 so I'll stay locked to 120. Frame timings have definitely been improved!  Super happy with the update so far, will continue to monitor and update you all!  Edit 1: Ran a game of Conquest on Mirak Valley and two rounds of RedSec, I could INSTANTLY feel and see the improved frame timing and smoothness overall. As stated above, also noticed little to no stuttering or micro-freezing that I was getting on 25.9.1. Will continue to update!  Edit 2: Had my first crash, tried to alt tab back into BF6 RedSec in the waiting room and my whole PC locked up ( could still hear my friends on discord though). Swapped over to borderless and haven't had any issues.",Positive

AMD,"Every time I ever saw pixel corruption like that it was because of RAM instability. And unfortunately RAM is fickle and hardware vendors take shortcuts.  It's not uncommon for RAM to be perfectly stable at X voltage and Y temperate, and very unstable just a little bit outside of that. It's not uncommon for MB makers to supply more voltage than they claim, because it generally helps with stability which reduces the cost of their returns and warranties. And it's not uncommon for instability to appear in only one specific place when your intuition tells you it should show up elsewhere too.  So my advice is test your RAM in cold and warm scenarios.

AMD,Hopefully it fixes bf6 crashing that's a big issue rn,Negative
AMD,Unless you use specific DX12/Vulkan extension that is introduced by particular driver version ;),Neutral
AMD,Intel drivers are by no means better. They seem to be since they add performance in more titles (compared to Nvidia/AMD) but that's more due to them being terrible at first and Intel working to fix those issues.,Negative

I recommend running like prime95 stress test for at least an hour and it should come back with zero errors. If it comes back with any errors, that means any video driver issues you had, could have been caused by CPU/memory problems.  (Correction: I had one strange issue with Minecraft (Java) and Complementary Reimagined 5.5.1 shader, where \~5% of the time when I used a bed to sleep, I would get a driver timeout, but I assumed it was a bad combination of mods and the shader I was using.

AMD,"I don't know what lying gets you \[[1](https://www.neowin.net/news/nvidia-drivers-confirmed-to-cause-bsod-on-windows-pcs-without-certain-cpu-instructions/)\]\[[2](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/556316/bsod-with-the-latest-versions-of-the-nvidia-driver/)\]\[[3](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-confirms-it-is-investigating-rtx-50-series-bsod-and-black-screen-troubles-no-timeline-for-a-fix)\], is quite clear on everyone who is copping.  Plus I didn't spend any $1000, the RX 6950 XT cost me 600€ and I getting 60FPS at 4K max settings, thank you for your unwarranted concern.",Neutral
AMD,ACC is UE 4.26. You can launch it in DX12 by adding -dx12 as a launch command. Let me know if it works and if it becomes less CPU bound.,Neutral
AMD,"So if I go into Adrenalin and restore the factory settings, it will revert to the previous driver, which in my case was 25.9.1?",Neutral
AMD,"I wasn't criticizing you, but rather the effectiveness of the bug reporting process and the apparent lack of fixes over the years that I've observed. Here's the same Cezanne that you said you tested. In five minutes, without leaving the spot, the performance degrades from 120 fps to 58 fps.     All drivers updated to the latest available version.  https://i.redd.it/k443c4kkq4yf1.gif",Negative
AMD,This makes sense from a marketing perspective. But ending standard support in 5 years is still too short for dGPU.,Neutral
AMD,"Thanks for the reply man, saved me logging in to only get more annoyed myself! Arc raiders for now it is!",Positive
AMD,If I go nvidia it's 5090 or 6090 only so yea too end onlys,Neutral
AMD,i know... as i said i tried most of this stuff. it exists but it might as well not. the performance hit is even worse than just running dx11.,Negative
AMD,"No, you do a clean install for 25.10.2. If you want to go back to 25.9.1 use DDU or the AMD tool and then install the 25.9.1.",Neutral
AMD,"are you making use of the recommended mods like large address aware? The last time I played through, I remember having to also use a reworked directInput module as the game would respond horribly to mouse input otherwise.  Looking at it now, EchoPatch seems like a recent development (or at least one only recently recommended), though seems to offer a comprehensive solution across many problem areas experienced when running on contemporary operating systems.  E: One other thing comes to mind, are you running this from Steam or GOG? I've only ever ran this through Steam (requiring the above mods). Looks like F.E.A.R. Platinum is in the GOG Preservation Program (thinking i should pick this edition up anyway).",Neutral
AMD,"He's not doubting that it occurs but there's known problems with FPS drops over time on modern systems that happens that happens regardless of vender so a driver can't fix it. Also assuming it's a driver issue without actually testing another vendor or at least older versions of drivers is a bit silly.  Oh and don't post screenshots as gif, it's disgusting (waste of bandwidth and hurts the eyes)...",Negative
AMD,"They aren't ending support, but you should expect some features not arriving to RDNA 1 and RDNA 2. (I wouldn't expect RDNA 2 to have FSR 4 officially)",Neutral
AMD,"If performance drops in DX12, then you're GPU bound and not CPU bound. Then your options remain upscaling and/or Frame Gen.",Neutral
AMD,But why would I have to do a clean install of 25.10.2 if I'm already on that version? Wouldn't it be easier to just run DDU and switch to version 25.9.1?,Neutral
AMD,"It's the Platinum version, from GOG. By installing the echo patch, performance increases to 200fps+, and degradation takes much longer to occur, but drops still happen, going down to 30fps.",Neutral
AMD,This Reddit only allows posting images in .gif format.,Neutral
AMD,"This also applies to Polaris and Vega if you think they are still supported. They do get Vulkan 1.4 on Linux, but end up with Vulkan 1.3 on Windows. RDNA1/2 suffered the same fate.",Neutral
AMD,"but how then 9070 xt and 5070 ti are basically equal performance in other gpu bound games, but in these even a 5070 does better....",Neutral
AMD,"That's neat, I'll need to pick up that GoG version to check in with. I've only ever used the Steam version on win10 and 11.  The Cezanne system I have has been dutifully running Fedora for a bit, will need to see if I have a spare m.2 NVMe disk to throw windows on. Can you tell me your windows build and in-game gfx settings?  e: Interestingly, there's an old [GoG forum post](https://www.gog.com/forum/fear_series/fear_fps_fix) from 2017 detailing the exact same issue you've described, with a link to a fix.",Neutral
AMD,Make sure you do the 4GB patch that Vik suggested. I'm playing through FEAR on my 7800XT and it runs perfectly after doing all the suggested pathes/tweaks from PCGamingWiki. https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/F.E.A.R.#4_GB_patch,Neutral
AMD,"https://i.imgur.com/UxevhaL.png  Can't you upload to an external site?

AMD,There are games and games. Plenty of games where AMD GPUs punch above equivalent tier Nvidia GPUs. It's not all 1:1.  7900 XTX matching 5080 in DOOM The Dark Ages that uses RT for example.,Neutral
AMD,"The slide also states a Zen 6 release in 2026 for the ""Venice"" Zen 6 EPYC.  And a planned release of openSIL Firmware for Medusa Zen 6 in the first half of 2027.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm happy about openCIL, I think transparency and collaborating with others is the key to reducing attack vectors. Alternatives to UEFI/BIOS like coreboot should benefit from this!",Positive
AMD,Zen 6 in 2027 = my 9800X3D will be king of the gaming hill for a good while yet,Positive
AMD,Nada do redstone?,Neutral
AMD,First half 2027 probably means real late 2027 for the 3D chips as well.,Neutral
AMD,9850x3d enters chat. lol,Neutral
AMD,"well, Intel is dead in the water so AMD is in no rush to release a half baked 3% performance increase.",Negative
AMD,It doesn't say anything about the release date of Zen 6.,Neutral
AMD,"I think with games i play ( not latest ) mmos and arpgs,il perfectly fine on my 5800x3d until 2028",Neutral
AMD,I don't think opensil firmware release date tells you much about the actual CPU release date.,Neutral
AMD,"That's just a 9800x3d that doesn't have one of the overclocking lockouts in place, one that a large fraction of motherboards can already bypass via asynchronous eclks.  Identical hardware and probably 0 change for enthusiasts; a touch better for people who don't overclock or who use the cheapest motherboards.",Neutral
AMD,Zen6% /s,Neutral
AMD,Not with that attitude,Neutral
AMD,"For Venice the plan according to the slides is to have an openSIL release within 3 months of the hardware release, and the stated goal of AMD is to shorten this time gradually until openSIL is released at the same time as the hardware, so I'd assume that for all Zen 6 hardware, the time between the hardware release and the openSIL release is at most 3 months.  While that doesn't really tell us anything about 3D chips, it would put the Medusa release sometime Q4 2026 to Q2 2027.",Neutral
AMD,Likely higher binned,Neutral
AMD,I still need to check if this kills psvr2 on my 7900xt or not - kind of an ass move to kill one of the unique features of that card.,Negative
AMD,\>AMD disables USB-C power on Radeon RX 7900  Isn't this a breach of contract or 'not as advertised' in some markets?,Negative
AMD,They're definitely not backporting fsr 4 to rdna 2 at this point,Neutral
AMD,Killing support for rdna2 this quick is criminal while nvidia is still supporting rtx 2000 series which is rdna1 counterpart... I am glad I got my 6800xt for barely 300$ from a gpu mining farm instead of buying at full price. Can't even imagine how I would feel,Negative
AMD,The USB-C port is the reason I bought a reference 7900 XT! I have a mini-ITX case with a handle and the USB-C port lets me do a quick one cable + power connection on any of my home desks or televisions. I now need to check if any of my unpowered hubs still work.,Neutral
AMD,My 6950 doesn't feel old enough to be pushed out already.  Makes me seriously consider getting nvidia for my replacement with this type of crap.,Negative
AMD,"the USB part is so baffling when you realize that the PSVR2 has an advantage on the reference cards due to requiring only one cable.   and WORSE still. its a catch 20/20 situation, this driver fixes a grave VR issue present for almost a year. but at the same time kills VirtualLink support.",Negative
AMD,"branching off RDNA2, a four year old gpu arch, while nvidia just got around to dropping pascal/maxwell, is...  not cool guys.",Negative
AMD,"This is some bs, they need to reverse this decision, AMD is getting a little too greedy, pulling stunts even nVidia haven't done yet,. There's no reason not to add FSR 4 support for older cards, and no one, unless it's tied to something breaking, should be allowed to disable features after release.",Negative
AMD,Man was gonna eventually upgrade to a 6000/7000 series card in the future from a 5700 xt. I fell like there’s no point now.,Negative
AMD,GTX1080 got like 9 years of support. 6800xt got 5years? Sorry amd this is my last card. Now with leaked unofficial support FSR4 that amd just decided not to implement. Im out boys,Negative
AMD,"Jesus christ.   GPUs like the 6800 XT are only 5 years old & being considered 'Legacy' & so thus getting degraded drivers. Meanwhile Turing GPUs from 2018 are still getting frequent full driver support (and so is the 11 year old GTX 980 for the time being). People wonder why people go for Nvidia for GPUs, but things like the official driver support are a very good reason why people go Nvidia, as they give frequent GPU drivers for older GPU series whilst AMD starts to kill them off after 5-6 years.",Negative
AMD,It's sad that amd often kills support or degrades the support faster than nvidia  I plan to upgrade my gpu soon ( my cpu upgrade is a 7800x3d already here ) but I will absolutely look more on the nvidia side.  6000 series isn't old yet and them already putting it on some weird 2nd branch isn't looking great.  I'd rather pay 50 or 100 more and don't have a badly supported gpu in a few years.,Negative
AMD,I hope that the sub-branch only means no AI stuff and they will keep supporting the GPU for at least another 3 years I just bought a Rx 6750xt 2 years ago damn...,Neutral
AMD,"im not so sure about getting a 9000 series now, like are you kidding? 5 years of support only? 20 series of rtx is 7 years old and theyre still getting support and new tech, absolutely pathetic",Negative
AMD,"Damn AMD doing everything they can to fuck over their own products as usual. I literally have a 7900xtx reference, definitely not buying AMD again now. Even NVIDIA still supports it on 20 series cards",Negative
AMD,"okay, i just tested and my HMD works, so does my [mini USB-C/Display doohickey](https://www.shophagibis.com/products/usb-c-docking-station-mini-pc-monitor), so VirtualLink is still working, which confuses me even more, so either they didn't disabled power delivery or they meant a complete different thing.  u/TsukikoChan for now seems that they haven't left us in the dark.  https://i.redd.it/hv1qy5xuyayf1.gif",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah...I have an RX 6950XT, thankfully did not pay anywhere near full price for it. If they're actually gutting driver support for a five year old architecture, one that is powering the current generation of consoles no less? My next card will not be AMD.   I would've begrudgingly accepted it had they done this in 2027-28. Wouldn't have been happy, but could've lived with it. This is just an atrociously short time frame, especially given how in recent UE5 games the RX 6950XT hangs around the RTX 5070 tier without heavy ray tracing.",Negative
AMD,"This is some mayor BS. My 6900xt is 3 years old and no longer supported. My next card will be Nvidia for sure. Thanks Amd, you just lost a customer.",Negative
AMD,"Very bad behaviour, now i'll think twice before buying a card that eventually will be dropped in a couple of years. Meanwile nvidia relased dlss4 even on 2018 hardware, at least this happened before i bought the 9070xt, i'd rather pay 100€ more for the competitor insted of buying a card that will eventually be abbandoned in less than 3 years.",Negative

AMD,I’m an old AMD fanboy but man it gets hard to stay one when they do this repeatedly of removing support and minimizing function and features of old cards over time. This seems to be a common theme of AMD.,Negative
AMD,"Thank you for making my move from my 6800XT (that could have gone down as one of the greatest cards if you supported it with FSR4) towards Nvidia upgrade so easy.  I hope your expectations for people to upgrade every other generation with planned obsolescence to completely bite you back in the ass.   You will NEVER see my money again, that is certain.  P.S. Fire the clown that came up with this strategy. Good luck.",Positive
AMD,My RX 6900 XT is more powerful than 80% of RDNA 3 cards…why no support!?,Negative
AMD,AMD just lost sooo many customers over dropping 6000 series support this soon... Huge mistake.,Negative

AMD,It’s a little ridiculous considering the 6800 XT is faster than most 4000 series cards like the 4070 but let’s put it  out to pasture. Still plenty of power.,Negative
AMD,"Part of it is that, while weaker, Turing has most of the hardware features of the 30, 40, and 50 series cards. RDNA4 is the first AMD generation to be more or less on feature parity with Turing.

But following this news, I'm going to have to just begrudgingly pay the additional premium to swap back to NVIDIA, so at least I know I can get as many years as I want out of the card without them pulling the rug out from under me by EOL'ing driver updates for perfectly functioning cards.

I actually use it as a ""docking station"", hooked up to an HDMI adapter and one of those ""branded"" USB-C adapter (3 USB-3 ports, a card reader, and I think a second HDMI port).

Or the old AMD-made linux drivers that AMD dropped support for because the Open ones were better in every way.  You do have a couple tradeoffs though... You don't get support for new things quite as immediately, and if you're on a slower moving distro, you might not get it for a while. Stuff like FSR 4 took a couple extra months to work on Linux, for instance. Also, because the HDMI forum is... Well, I don't have nice things to say about them, but they blocked HDMI 2.1 from working on Linux, so on linux AMD card HDMI ports are limited to HDMI 2.0 and don't get VRR support among other things, and AMD is legally not allowed to do anything to fix that.",Neutral

AMD,Rdna 2 don't have AI core and it run very slow with the int8 model,Neutral
AMD,"If i were to hazard a guess, one of the CVEs is probably to do with secure comms or usb standards and amd probably thought it easier to take off the feature rather than get it working under a cve. Another hazarding guess, it probably doesn't follow a standard they said they are, they got caught, and just got rid of it rather than address it.",Negative
AMD,It does make sense. AMD doesn't want you to use their cards for too long. They want you to upgrade every gen.,Neutral
AMD,"Oh, I see. You need that connectivity for the psvr2 to function, so a cheap usbc hub might not do, though passing usbc through a switch and converting to hdmi and so on are quite different things. While usbc to hdmi adaptors are really cheap to get a proper expansion hub is very expensive. I don't have psvr2 but it's not clear to me that that's what required if it's just to add power to the usbc port.",Neutral
AMD,at that point why not just buy the adapter for $60?,Neutral
AMD,"No, that’s different. If I fully disclosed that I’ve locked a physical function behind a payment and someone still buys the product then they’re the idiot. That’d be like if AMD charged $50 to access the USB-C functionality in the first place, but this is the equivalent of BMW offering the heated seats initially and then stripping them via software later (effectively having sold a product with a function and then removed it after the sale).",Negative
AMD,"Also fair, yeah. Nonetheless, I would take “fine wine” over whatever this new shift from AMD is though.",Neutral
AMD,"Its true that what fine wine really meant was that the drivers where not good enough to squeeze out all the performance of the hardware at launch.  But in practice, If I bough a card based on the price/performance ratio at launch, I'm still happy too see it improve over time.",Neutral
AMD,Silly like dropping support for GPUs released under half a decade ago…I could see it at this point.,Negative
AMD,"Same, got it in 2023 I think. And they're still selling them at 300 euros, absolutely absurd.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, “AMD ages like fine wine” has honestly been more true on Linux than windows for a fair amount of time - but that’s just the nature of FOSS when actually talented, passionate people work on it.",Positive
AMD,INT8 version 'leaked' and can be run on older AMD cards while providing much better visual fidelity with very little performance drop compared to FSR 3.,Positive
AMD,Now that's interesting. I wonder how it's emulating that. Is it getting converted to FP16 or BF16 and then doing the maths in that precision?,Neutral
AMD,typically when you split the driver branch its because you're putting one of them into maitenance,Neutral
AMD,I mean we know that android phones could run the newest android versions even with like 7-9 yo phones (rip custom roms 😭),Neutral
AMD,Very much the opposite. Apple used to degrade performance deliberately on only slightly older phones. Get sued for it.,Neutral
AMD,The RDNA 3/4 version of the driver is 900mb.  The combined version with RDNA 1 and 2 support is the 1.5GB one.,Neutral
AMD,Adrenalin 25.10.2 (WHQL Recommended) is 902 MB.  Nvidia 581.57 is 896 MB.  These are very normal sizes for how many features they've added in recent years and how many thousands of games they support with custom code. They're really not growing that fast considering how fast flash storage has gotten cheap. It's like 50 MB/year or something?,Neutral
AMD,The main driver download includes both branches and their separate installers.,Neutral

AMD,Companies 1000x smaller can still support products longer.  Yes. It is bullcrap and not reality.,Negative
AMD,"This is what the AMD Stans can't seem to understand. As someone who's used both Radeon and GeForce stuff, I can tell you... NVIDIA even when they remove support, they just get it right from the beginning. With GeForce you get 99% of the performance day 1. Rather than waiting months for the full performance of my card, NVIDIA gives it basically right away.  The whole FineWine argument makes no sense to me, these cards have a limited shelf life, if the first 6 months you're getting gimped performance, how is that a good thing? These cards are only relevant for maybe 24 months and their support is maybe 6 years of support if you're lucky with AMD and more like 8 years with NVIDIA. If I have to wait 4-6 months to get the full performance of my card, then any money you saved buying AMD is basically mute imo. The extra $50-100 is worth getting the full performance day 1 rather than waiting months for it. Especially if the issue is making the device completely unusable.   Then take into account black screen issues, game issues, multi-monitor power usage and inconsistent driver updates where like you said AMD may not ship a driver every month. I just never understood the FineWine thing... Now I will be fair and say NVIDIA's drivers honestly haven't been the best with Blackwell, but they've been just bad relative to how they were with Ampere, Pascal, Turing etc. They're still a lot better than AMD's worst driver moments the past couple of years and they're no where near Intel's driver problems for GFX. So NVIDIA is still the better choice in terms of driver support and I will give AMD credit, they held back RDNA4 to work on drivers more and it helped them a lot.  Either way, I'm tired of this duopoly and the GPU industry in general, too many people not willing to call out the BS from any of these companies and all of them are just screwing consumers. I honestly wished Intel was going to do better, but they've lagged for three generations now and they're looking like they'll abandon dGPU altogether.",Negative
AMD,I’ll gladly pay Nvidia $2000 for performance that laps everything else if it means I won’t need to worry about driver support being gone after a mere half decade. Nvidia JUST ended support for Pascal (as in they’re doing the same thing for a May 2016 GPU arch that AMD is now doing for a November 2020 arch).,Negative
AMD,"I'm also talking about stuff that happened almost 10 years ago.  But it is part of the reasons my friends and I have avoided AMD GPUs.  We had consistently had bad experiences with it, including driver related problems like this.  And here we are literally talking about AMD removing a feature from a product that released less than 3 years ago that nvidia is still supporting on products it released 7 years ago, and hasn't even included on anything newer than that.",Negative
AMD,"Vega/Radeon VII, RDNA1, and Vega APUs staring at you like Samuel L Jackson rn.",Neutral
AMD,"2 gens doesn't mean stuff , you could say the 7000 series are also 1 gen behind the 9000 series yet in most cases it's only a 5-10% difference.  These gpus are only 5 years old don't defend a multi billion dollar company it's not your friend dude.",Negative

AMD,Nah that has been disproven.,Neutral
AMD,> amd probably thought it easier to take off the feature rather than get it working under a cve  You're probably right. That's exactly what Intel did with undervolting (laptop) CPUs a while back. It made me pretty upset given I couldn't rollback my BIOS far enough to get around it.,Negative
AMD,"Hopefully it's all a moot point and it works for OP anyway, due to needing less than 10 watts.  You're right though, I'm pretty sure there's inline power enhancement adapters for USB-C which would likely cost way less.",Positive
AMD,"Again, this is all on conjecture that's probably a moot point (7.2w should be easy even if PD is disabled), but probably because the adapter is hot garbage, at least so far as I've read/heard.  4K @ 120hz is a hard sell even under the best of circumstances, and being able to bypass any kind of active conversion in display/data pipes is definitely preferable.",Negative
AMD,The youngest GPU is 6750 GRE from October 2023. But there's handhelds that are being sold and released literally rn. Like the xbox ally (non x) for 600$ and base model legion go 2 for 1100$.,Neutral
AMD,I got mine for 250CAD and new ones are now 300+ CAD it’s crazy! It’s a great card and you can play 1440 if you turn down a few settings.,Positive
AMD,"This + when the company isn’t a sole maintainer, they can’t just go and remove some stuff when they feel like it, because that will be contested by others. So the least they can do is not invest anything specifically to improve old hardware, but that mantle will be picked up by others evidently (in this case it’s a Valve contractor)",Negative
AMD,"Interesting. Do you have some articles I could look at? I assume that FSR is powered by some kind of deep learning model and that this is a quantized version of that model.  I have not been using AMD for graphics for a little bit to be honest, so I don't really know what the latest developments are.",Neutral

AMD,It was when battery got down to 80% of capacity. they made that into a function,Neutral
AMD,Good. Punish these clowns with our wallets. I am upgrading my current 6800XT with the Nvidia 6xxx line-up and I threw my plans for AMD 10XXX cards in the garbage.,Negative
AMD,True words,Neutral
AMD,Again you are using performance to judge if it's old or not.  Nvidia gpus get full feature and driver optimization for 5-6 years on average. So amd is not doing anything crazy here.,Negative
AMD,Yep. I tried it for the first time on Outer Worlds 2 and it looks so much better I thought my brain was making shit up.,Positive
AMD,"Wait, that was the fix for plundervolt?!",Neutral
AMD,"It splits the signal, not conversion. Your GPU is doing the same thing over it's USB port.   They both maintain DP 1.4. One does it over USB-C DP alt and the other does it over a DP cable.   The VR2 adapter does what it should do, it's been reliable. The software was buggy in the beginning, but that wasn't exclusive to the adapter. What issues did you hear about?  The hub you linked requires thunderbolt host or USB4 for all the good features. It's an expensive path if you don't have a native port. Add in cards are pricey and didn't work well for me.  The [SUNIX UPA2015](https://www.sunix.com/en/product_detail.php?cid=1&kid=2&gid=11&pid=2146) is an option as well and cost ~$40",Neutral

AMD,"> I wouldn't be surprised to see NVidia going the same route as AMD to cut costs now that the precedent has been set. I'd wager they're keeping a very close eye on consumer discord to see if they can follow suite.  I'm not sure what do you mean by this. AMD cutting driver support soon is nothing new. Ass stated, HD 6000 cards only had driver support for less than 5 years. That happened 10 years ago and nVidia hasn't followed suite.",Neutral
AMD,You are right.  I'm using an old as hell driver for my nvidia GPU because otherwise I run into issues.  And it probably only works for me because I'm too poor to play new games now.

AMD,"I didn't see those articles until I made that comment. Technically what I said isn't wrong. This is a different variant than the official FSR4 as the official FSR4 is FP8.

HP for example has hundreds of models that change by location, store, and just over time. Why do they do that? So you have no choice but to buy whatever they offer you.  It backfires with tech-savy consumers though. I bought a Ryzen system specifically because AMD had an understandable naming convention at the time and Intel didn't.",Negative
AMD,"Ah, you are missing something really important here - what the actual customers want.  The customer for laptop chips is not the end consumer like you or I, but large laptop OEMs .  And those companies want regular rebadged names for the cheaper older chips, as they believe newer names equals more sales.  Hard to blame AMD for making their direct customers happy.    Note how for stuff that has more direct consumer sales like desktop chips they don't do the rebadge game (granted the desktop chips do have some questionable naming decisions, but the same chips keep the same name), likewise for the professional stuff.",Neutral
AMD,"There were SKUs that had a third and even a fourth digit in previous generations like the 5825U (mind you that is a Barcelo part, which was basically a small refresh of Cezanne). But AMD really popularized it and introduced it with the 7000 series to provide ""clarity"" as to what architecture something is. Why did they do that? Because in that same 5000 series lineup they had a mix of Zen2 and Zen3 parts. Like the 5300U which was Lucienne architecture, which was Zen2, but the 5800U was Zen3 Cezanne.  But it's just stupid because with the 6000 series, everything was Zen 3+, so whether you bought a 6800U or a 6600U it was all Zen3+. It didn't matter what you picked and tbh that's how they should have carried on, only make the new stuff the new generation naming.  In the 7000 series though they went back to the 5000 series naming sort of because they decided to mix old architectures again with the new stuff. For example, the 7735HS a Zen 3 chip and the 7745HX a Zen4 chip, that one third digit is supposed to notify you that you're buy Zen4, therefore it was as an indicator as to what Ryzen generation you were buying, but it just confused consumers even more because some people thought a 7640HS was worse than a 7735HS, but in single core the 7640HS beat the 7735HS and in multi-thread both were about even.  In the end, AMD made a shit solution to a shit solution, all of their own making and now they've come up with ANOTHER shit solution to try and ""fix it"".",Neutral

But even before that the 7735HS (which is the former name of the 170) was bad because many people thought it was Zen4 like the 7745HX was because of the 7000 series moniker and the fact it too is a Ryzen 7.

AMD,> it's previous generation silicon  Some of it is way worse than even that. There are _Zen 2_ chips (previous-previous-previous?) implicated here. That is some shamelessly re-badged garbage on AMD's part. These chips are barely even new enough to run Windows 11.,Negative
AMD,"No the real problem is they keep changing it every other generation. Maybe the new one makes more sense than the one before, but then again the one before that was even better. As a customer it is impossible for me to keep up, so the likelihood of me buying something expecting the latest CPUs and ending up with something from half a decade ago is disturbingly high. There is also no guarantee they won't change it again in a few years.",Negative
AMD,"For what it's worth, availability of the Athlon 7120U was **extremely** limited. I should know as I was trying to look for a laptop with that chip that didn't have 4GB of RAM with it, which effectively limited me to some really obscure HP slop box.   It doesn't make it excusable per se, but you'd have to stumble upon one of these completely at random or entirely intentionally to end up with one.",Negative
AMD,"The problem's that the moment these come onto the market isn't the moment every single older laptop gets wiped off the market, especially considering these are practically the same chips being re-released time and time again by AMD. Here's an example:  One customer looks at 5 budget laptops and their processors. #1 has a Ryzen 5 7520U, #2 has a Ryzen 3 7440U, #3 has a Ryzen 5 220, #4 has an older, discounted Ryzen 5 5600U, #5 has a Ryzen 5 40. Place your bets on the best one now.  Where do you even begin to compare these? Well, the Ryzen 5 7520U has a higher number than the Ryzen 3 7440U and the Ryzen 5 5600U, so it should be better, right? Wrong. Both the 7520U and 7440U are 4-cores, 8-threads, but the Ryzen 5 7520U has a 15W TDP, 4MB of L3 cache, is Zen 2-based (from 2019), and has a Radeon 610M iGPU. Meanwhile, the 7440U has a 28W TDP, 8MB of L3 cache, is Zen 4-based (3 years newer), and has a Radeon 740M iGPU. It's going to be an order of magnitude faster than the chip that's a higher number than it. As for the Ryzen 5 5600U? It's a 6-core, 12-thread Zen 3 chip with a 15W TDP, 16MB of L3 cache, with a much inferior Vega 7 iGPU.  Okay... so the Ryzen 7520U is a no-go, and the Ryzen 7440U and Ryzen 5600U are kind of up for debate if you have a dGPU in these laptops (though absolutely pick the 7440U if the iGPU is the only form of graphics onboard). Well what's up with the Ryzen 5 40? What generation does that fall under? If the third digit of the 7000 series was architecture, and the first digit of the 5000 series was architecture, is the Ryzen 5 40... Zen 4 based? Well no, you're not supposed to know that, you're supposed to just believe it's a new chip. Well we know it's a Zen 2 4-core 8-thread with 4MB of L3 cache from the article, but this potential customer doesn't. They'll find it out if they research it, but by this point they're probably getting sick of researching CPUs when the vast majority of people know barely anything more than an Intel i7 or Ryzen 7 being good, and an RTX graphics also being good. They most likely don't know anything about cores, architectures, TDP, or L3 cache, and probably just want a working laptop.  What about the, uh, Ryzen 5 220? That seems... probably a fair bit worse than the Ryzen 3 7440U and Ryzen 5 5600U going off the name and potentially being connected in naming scheme to the Ryzen 5 40, so it's worse, right? Nope. The Ryzen 5 220 is a 6-core, 12-thread, Zen 4-based, 28W chip with 16MB of L3 cache, and Radeon 740M graphics. A clear choice to pick that gets the best of both worlds with regards to the cores & cache of the older chip, and the newer architecture and iGPU of the newer chip.  Outside of this hypothetical scenario now, I want to add an honourable mention to compare to the Ryzen 5 220. I'd like to bring up the Ryzen AI 5 330, which is a Zen 5-based 4-core 8-thread 28W chip with 8MB of L3 cache, and Radeon 820M graphics. It's got less cores and less L3 cache than the Ryzen 5 220 and most likely will be worse in benchmarks [(and as a matter of fact, it is)](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/6616vs6917/AMD-Ryzen-5-220-vs-AMD-Ryzen-AI-5-330), but despite this is a tier above (X20 v. X30) the 220, and very few will catch that the newer chip is worse than the older one. Even chips within this new naming scheme are inconsistent.  When these chips come out, the laptop market isn't going to have done away with the older chips for no good reason. [These chips are still out there](https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-ThinkPad-Notebook-Keyboard-Professional/dp/B0FT3CR5VK), and customers looking for an AMD chip are gonna regret looking for one if they have to compare this kind of shit. This naming scheme's only a year old with the Ryzen AI 300 series, and the previous one (where the architecture was defined by the third digit) lasted two generations from 2023 to 2024. Pre-2023 laptops are perfectly usable for the average person and they're still going to be selling those laptops today, and god help anyone looking for an AMD laptop that has to deal with this naming BS. Intel's not much better with their 200V series but at least it looks like they're going to stay the course and keep using that naming scheme now that desktop and mobile are somewhat unified. AMD's just drunkenly driving off a cliff with their mobile naming scheme and landing on another cliff they'll drive off on in a year or two. Meanwhile, their desktop chips are very easy to understand in comparison. No random digit amount switching, no sneaky third digit signifying architectures, or any of that nonsense. The Ryzen 5 9600 is faster than the Ryzen 5 7600. Easy.",Neutral

But hey there's a 8945HS and that has AI. So does the 9000 series for laptop have AI too? What's the latest too, is it the 300 series or the 9000 series?

AMD,"You can judge a CPU based on if it's a Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5, or Ryzen 7, but that's not really a good idea beyond a generalization. A Ryzen 7 1800X is much worse than a Ryzen 5 7600. An Intel i7-870 is much worse than an Intel i3-12100.  Going past the obvious, a Ryzen 9 9900X is worse for gaming than a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, and Ryzen 7 5700 is worse than a Ryzen 5 5600 (because the 5700 is a special chip - whereas usually chips like the 5600 are based off lower-clocked 5600Xs under the same architecture, the 5700 is based off the 5700G with PCIe 3.0 and much lower L3 cache. This continues with mobile hardware, from my comment above, with CPUs like the Ryzen 3 7440U and the Ryzen 5 7520U. One is two architectures newer, with double the L3 cache, double the TDP, with higher clocks, and a better iGPU. You'd think it to be the Ryzen 5 of the same ""generation"" (7000U) but it's not.  Desktop CPUs are easier (most of the time, there's still chips like the Ryzen 7 5700 though) but what I was saying up above is that AMD is making their laptop CPU naming schemes hard by switching them up every few generations, and it's almost certainly intentional to mislead consumers.",Negative

AMD,"Well AMD is doing a better job right now.   However I actually believe both manufactures have failed the APU market by not focusing more die space on things outside of the CPU core count.   The need for a bunch of relatively slow CPU cores is not what most of us wanted out of an APU.   8 simple fast CPU cores and a robust GPU would have been a better focus.   These days you need plenty of AI acceleration too.  Frankly the latest Strix APU's from AMD are a lot closer to meeting most users needs.   They still allocate a lot of space to CPU's but on the positive side the GPU is now robust and we have AI acceleration.  Of course Intels real failure is that they don't have a low power process which means they never had chips to put into NUC sized machines.   Even if they got the die allocation right, Intels chips would just run to hot.   So yeah AMD.   It would be even better if we had a high performance ARM based solution outside of Apple's.  Frankly Apple seems to know what to do with hardware these days (their software sucks but that is another manner) in a way that the other chip suppliers don't.   For example no hyper-threading but extremely fast CPU cores.   Then they add decent GPU's, AI acceleration and other special function units.",Negative

AMD,"It will, but bear in mind your 9070XT likely has a triple-slot cooler and a higher TDP than this card will. This is dual-slot, in a blower, and capped at 300W. 9070XTs regularly get near 340W. This will also likely get above its rated 2350mhz clock, and it's rated up to 2920mhz. But, Asrock rates their Taichi 9070XT at 2570mhz base and 3100mhz boost. That puts the 9070XT at a roughly 6% advantage if both are hitting their max clocks. Not much and I expect slight driver differences to exaggerate it a bit too. Based on my experience with the W7900DS (dual-slot N31 48GB) I expect this one to maintain around 280W under load and probably sit in the 2800-2900mhz range.",Neutral

AMD,"There are few key differences.  a) First, PCIe 5.0 interface rather than 4.0. So technically double the bandwidth if you DO need to send any data to the card during your wokloads.  b) 32GB VRAM vs 24GB IS a major difference for the use case. You can barely fit 16-17GB model on a 24GB VRAM card once you also count in the context size. But 32GB? Easy.  c) Blower style cooler and 2-slot height, AMD is generally speaking expecting most target users to be buying **two** of these. It's going to be hard with 7900XTX.   d) a bit lower power consumption.  Honestly it's not a bad value proposition at it's price. Yeah, you are paying double for the same specs as 9070XT, just twice the VRAM. But as far as AI premium goes it's genuinely pretty reasonable compared to most other options.",Neutral
AMD,Still slower no matter where you put it,Negative
AMD,Given it's not far off the 5080 in price depending on where you are (+$135 over the FE near me) the price actually seems downright reasonable for a 32GB card. I'm mostly interested in this as a CFD card where Vram capacity is king. For $1300 this sure as hell beats the 5090's value and having twice the memory over a 5080 is very attractive. Biggest competitor in my book is either a pair of B50s or a B60 Dual.,Positive

AMD,"You can use riser cables for 7900XTX if you cant put two next to each other. A really fast ssd reads at 14GB/sec, so not much advantage from PCIe 5.0. You dont load models that often, typically you load one and start using it. With 3 fans and better heatsink, gpu can use more power and boost clocks to give you most performance when you need it. Huge price increase for just 8GB extra, is not worth it. You could go with 48 or 64GB if you really need it, there is always going to be a model that you cant fit in vram.",Neutral
AMD,"My thoughts exactly, more V-ram for cheaper/same price = more better.  Now that real-time rendering in games is a debate between 140 fps or 130 fps (ignoring the dumpster-fire games that run at 30 fps wether you like it or not, despite looking like someone rubbed vaseline all over the camera, those failed tech demos don't count in my books) the V-ram has become the real selling point of the card. Not only does it give you more versatility in productivity scenarios, but it also makes games run more smoothly at the same time (and in some instances, makes the difference between a game even running or not at all).  Honestly would be nice if we could swap out our V-ram, or had unified ram and could use our M-board ram for the GPU as well.  Or better still, dedicate 2 ram slots to the CPU, and the other 2 ram slots (which are usually empty and useless since you lose performance running 4 sticks in most scenarios nowadays) are dedicated to the GPU as MOAR V-RAM.  That would actually be epic and massively increase the adaptability and versatility of each individual GPU, which would also increase competition too (meaning cheaper GPU's that are also significantly better).",Positive
AMD,Each compute unit is significantly faster on RDNA4 and far more versatile for ML workloads. Memory bandwidth comparisons are meaningless as they’re different architectures and RDNA4 is more memory efficient than RDNA3.,Positive
AMD,">A really fast ssd reads at 14GB/sec, so not much advantage from PCIe 5.0  It's 64GB/s vs 32GB/s (at x16 speeds). I am not saying you should stream data from your **SSD** into a GPU. More like RAM -> GPU. In some situations it will double your results. Admittedly for LLMs inference PCIe bandwidth is not THAT important (x4 4.0 so far seems to be sufficient) but it could make a difference in training.  >gpu can use more power and boost clocks to give you most performance when you need it  For LLMs it's primarily memory bandwidth that matters. Higher boost clocks mostly increase your electricity bill. It also means more heat and with a triple fan design bottom card just blows all the air back into your system.  >You can use riser cables for 7900XTX if you cant put two next to each other  You can if you have a massive case or are literally plugging video cards outside of it. On the other hand, consider a relatively cheap TRX50 board:  [https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/TRX50-AERO-D-rev-10](https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/TRX50-AERO-D-rev-10)  You can shove 2-3x R9700 without any fiddling.  >Huge price increase for just 8GB extra, is not worth it  If you are after 24GB cards then you shouldn't buy 7900XTX either to begin with. You go on ebay and hunt for 3090s. Arc Pro B60 is an option too if you find it at a reasonable price.  32GB is a different story. Right now this is the cheapest card offering this much. Whether you personally find it worth it or not is a different story but as far as workstation grade hardware goes... honestly it's not **that** much of a markup. Just look at how much you pay for a consumer grade 5090, let alone an RTX Blackwell.",Neutral
AMD,"I definitely agree on wishing vram was upgradable by the user. Perhaps in the future something like LPCAMM could provide that suitable interconnect. A 128-bit interface per module would mean that even the biggest modern busses only need to fit 4 of them.  As for unified memory, I don't think many people on these forums will like the road that takes us down. Like it or not, the future (at least near future) of that path is things like Lunar Lake, Apple Silicon, and Strix Halo. Those are all very impressive SoCs, but you may have to trade the ability to upgrade your GPU separately from the CPU to get your upgradable unified memory.  As for dedicating certain slots on the motherboard to each side, CPU and GPU, that gets you the worst of both worlds in some ways. Your memory is no longer unified, the full bandwidth is not directly accessible to either in most architectures, but you can upgrade it. If you are going to go down the route of integrating the CPU and GPU to use the same memory and connections, give both access to all of it in full bandwidth.",Neutral
AMD,"Isn't AI memory intensive? Doesnt bandwidth matter? You can have faster compute units, but they can be memory starved. Also 7900xtx has more compute units, this should make up for some of the speed gap.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm with you on this. At 32GB+ your options are slim right now. The B60 Dual is the only other thing I find particularly attractive that is somewhat near this, though that is 2x24GB per card rather than a single 32GB. The W7800 also offers 32GB on a 256-bit bus, but this card is substantially faster than that and currently cheaper.",Positive
AMD,"How have I not hears of LPCAMM until now!?  Yeah, in an ideal world you would have M-board that has 3 separate chip sockets, one for your CPU, one for your unified RAM, and one for your GPU chip. It would probably look something like 3 CPU sockets.  Which would also make cooling very easy and scalable, something our current M-board layout didn't account for. They did account for development add-on cards however so it was a necessary step and an integral part of computer design history. However now that we've optimised general use computers to CPU, GPU, and RAM (ignoring storage, keeping that scalable with addon slots is definitely the way) I do definitely feel that new layout standard is due.  Of course that's an ideal world where CPU, GPU, and RAM manufacturers all agree on the same socket, we'd probably need some kind of modular M-board that allows the use of whatever Intel, Nvidia, AMD, etc.... GPU, CPU, and RAM sockets each company invents, otherwise you'd get stuck in a closed ecosystem where you're at the whim of the manufacturer of wether you're allowed to have more RAM or a more powerful GPU or a more efficient CPU or not.  Though it's nice to dream of a more optimal computer layout (of course my personal take is to have the CPU and GPU on opposite sides of the M-board, that way they each get their own separate airflow, and also the backside of each socket/slot can get some extra passive cooling which would help with the higher and higher clock speeds our chips are now reaching).  It is the worst of both worlds, however it is highly scalable and if the GPU had it's own dedicated memory controller then it could work as an alternative where you have double the memory, but each chip only sees half of that memory. I imagine in high-demand dynamic workloads where the CPU wants more RAM one second, then the GPU wants more ram the next, that having separated RAM for each chip could become a benefit and act as a safety margin. Though I do agree that it's probably not the best idea and would require just as much of a redesign as unified RAM would.  Unless you just put RAM stick slots on the GPU (probably a really good use case for LPCAMM as that would allow you to maintain the same backplate clearance standard current GPU's are built to) then independent scalable RAM would just be a direct upgrade to our current layout as-is.  Though I definitely want discrete chips on an M-board with unified memory (and probably some extra silicone chip, hell you could probably split the traditional rasterisation GPU chip and the RT/AI/Tensor/etc... chip into separate sockets) cause that would mean having 3-4 AIO's on your board with nothing else and that would just look too cool imho.",Neutral

AMD,"No doubt ""about"" it.",Neutral
AMD,"Not in the context of VRAM. You have two boxes 32cm long. Can you fit 45cm long figurine? Answer is no, it will just hit the side of one of the boxes. You can however fit two 32cm long figurines.  In ""AI"" world it works kinda similar. 2 cards of 32GB each can sometimes act as 2 devices with 32GB, can sometimes be used as 64GB with caveats OR actually behave as a 64GB VRAM pool.  For instance image generative AI has very dense, linear models. They have to fit in full. So for their purpose you have 2 GPUs, each with around 640GB/s bandwidth and 32GB memory each. You can produce twice as much AI slop by running 2 applications at once but you can't speed up producing a single one or use a really large model that exceeds 32GB.  In order to treat it as 64GB you would need to go over PCI Express bus instead and transfer data back and forth between cards. Which at x8/x8 configuration would be 32GB/s. So you can but it would absolutely slaughter your performance. Cards have to constantly communicate as each does the entire workflow.  But LLMs are different. You can split a 64GB model into 2 chunks of 32GB each. Card #1 does part of the workload, then it hands it to #2. They don't actually talk nearly as much. So for the biggest part 2 cards of 32GB = 64GB, they don't rely so much on PCI-Express.  And in the professional world there are also connections superior to PCIe. Nvidia H100 has like 3TB/s internal bandwidth but it also has 900GB/s NVLink. So if you need to stack 2 together - you can and performance penalty is not nearly as much as on consumer grade cards.  So yea, 2x32GB in PC world can sometimes mean it's still 32GB :)",Neutral

They have one of the smallest form factor compared to other ChiNUCs and are bare-bones, which is exactly what I'm after. The question is, does Sapphire deliver in the quality department?  The entire market is pretty overpriced, so I have my doubt that it'll improve even in a year. As for a Strix Halo model from Sapphire, pretty aure that won't happen.",Negative

AMD,"Cool, the bot seems to react very sensitive to politics. Guess I have change my comment. Here we go again.  I guess the possibility for them to branch out is there, but I just don't see it... yet. Especially given that Strix Halo is way past ""embedded"".  The global trading chaos and the AI demand already drove hardware to a long-time high. Seeing the current situation, businesses will likely keep on outbidding consumers by the looks of it. DDR5 SO-DIMM also spiked in pricing since August, costing twice as much on some occasions now. I made a lucky choice though and already bought the RAM and NVMe earlier this year. I'm just waiting for the EDGE AI models at this point.  I'm very much set on getting the Edge AI 370, but I'm still slightly concerned due to the compact cooling. Their reputation in the community comes from GPUs, I just hope that it carries over to their embedded department, I would hate to be wrong.

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance. I’ve shown full system specs and game settings every time, and provided more evidence than any tech site or tech YouTuber ever has, yet some people are still in denial.

AMD,"if there isnt cpu bottleneck your score should be around 135fps, can you give it one last try with sharpness set to 0.",Neutral
AMD,"What’s fake about it? What scores are you getting? Prove me wrong with score screenshots, not with fanboyism false accusations. If you’re comparing score screenshots to OBS-recorded videos, you shouldn’t, because OBS uses about 15% of GPU resources, which reduces the scores slightly. I’ve been talking about this and calling out tech sites and tech tubers on Twitter and Reddit for over a month. Do you really think they’d stay silent all this time if I were wrong? If I were faking benchmark scores, they would have publicly shown their results and shut me up for good, especially since I’ve been accusing them of corruption on a daily basis. Just yesterday Tech power up is the first techsite to block me on X for sharing my benchmark screenshot on their page, cowards, shouldn't they discuss what did i do wrong in my benchmark, then again what are they gonna say AMD paid us too much money that we need 10 years in hard work to make that much.",Negative

AMD,"Intel still trying to sell their already abandoned platform, they should learn something good from AMD and provide support for three generations per socket (and yes, Zen 6 will use AM5, already confirmed by AMD).",Neutral
AMD,"Two things can be true at the same time. Arrow lake has legitimately improved since it launched last year, and Intel is portraying it in the best, most optimal light they can that is probably not representative of a broad spectrum of games reviewed by a third party.   It would be interesting to get a retest of arrow lake now, but I dunno if it is worth the time investment for some reviewer like TPU or HWUB to re-review a relatively poor platform that’s already halfway out the door.",Positive
AMD,"Arrow Lake performs quite well at general compute and power efficiency compared to prior generatons ans even against AMD.  Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU. Ironically the 9070 performance was identical with a 9700X and a 9800X3D.  So it's actually kind of the reverse, gaming reviewers painted Arrow Lake in the worst possible light.",Neutral
AMD,What do you mean by gaslighting in this case?,Neutral
AMD,"The answer depends on whether or not you're a ""next-gen AI gamer"" (apparently that means 1080p avg fps with a RTX 5090).",Neutral
AMD,I doubt they would give false numbers. Those are probably what you get with the setup they list in fine print. Also they pretty clearly show the 3dx parts are faster in gaming. But they have probably picked examples that show them in a good light.   There is nothing wrong per se in the arrow lake lineup. In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all. The issue that destroyed the image of arrow lake is that the previous generation was often faster in gaming. That made every reviewer give it bad overall reviews.,Neutral
AMD,Wait till refresh comes out in December... Memory latency lower and performance boosted. Price also lower... Wish it could come to the old chips but it architecturally cant. :(,Negative
AMD,"generally they cherry pick, so maybe the demo they use is process heavy with minimal I/O (arrow's biggest performance hit is memory movement). if you manage to keep memory movement low core performance is actually really good on arrow lake. it just gets massacred by d2d and NGU latency, which they don't get a pass for but its unfortunate that decent core designs are held back severely by packaging.",Negative
AMD,"there is just no way dude lol  even their comparisons make no sense, 265K = 9800X3D / 265KF = 9700X? lol? how would that even be possible",Negative

AMD,Hardware unboxed isn't a reliable source.,Neutral
AMD,"As a real world example, I upgraded my primary system from a 14700k to a 265k recently. My other desktop is a ryzen 7900 (non x, 65 watt tdp)  Compiling my os takes 6 minutes on the 7900, 10 minutes on the 265k, 10 minutes on a 3950x, and 16 minutes on the 14700k.   That is not in windows, but my os which does not have thread director or custom scheduling for e cores. (So going to be worse than windows or Linux)   All the numbers except the 7900 are with the same ssd, psu, custom water loop.  The motherboard and cpu changed between Intel builds and the 3950x was the previous build before the 14700k.   The e core performance significantly improved in arrow lake.  It’s now keeping up with 16 core am4 parts in the worst possible scenario for it.  If the scheduler was smarter, I think it would be very close to the 7900.   In windows, it’s pretty close in games I play on frame rate to the old chip. A few are actually faster.",Neutral
AMD,"> And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  Yeah, 10% less performance when frequency matched is quite a lot.",Neutral
AMD,Telling people that its performance is better than it actually is?,Negative
AMD,The ones with similar pricing not performance,Neutral
AMD,"True, except AM5 supported all cpus 7000, 9000 and will support the newest one. So not exactly true per se, because you need a new motherboard every time and those on AM5 can upgrade cpu without buying a board. Imagine if someone was on 13400F and wanted to buy lets say 285K? Well, you need a new board. So it depends what “cheaper” is seen as.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep. We all see the patterns here. Gamers nexus, HUB, LTT and most big name they all keep mocking Intel, even when Intel did good job to bring improvements to their products like fixing Arrow Lake gaming performance but those ""tech reviewer"" decided to be blind, they don't even want to revisit Intel chip and benchmark it, they don't even want to educate their viewers.    At the same time they keep overhyping Amd products to the moon like they own the stock, it's obvious now who is the real reviewer and who is fraud reviewer using their own popularity and big headline to spread their propaganda for their own benefits. They are just as worse as shady company!",Negative
AMD,"Platform longevity isn't stupid lol. There's a reason why am4 is one of the best selling and one of the best platforms of all time. The fact that you can go from a 1700x to a 5800x3d on the same mobo for 85% more performance is crazy good value. You can say that all you want but there's a reason why in the diy market everyone is buying amd over intel. People know arrow lake is doa where as am5 actually has a future, which is why everyone is flocking to the 9800x3d in droves.  Zen 7 is rumored to be on am5 as well. Meaning that am6 would come out in 2030/2031. If that's true am5 lived for around 8/9 years.  That's insane value to get out of one socket.",Positive
AMD,Quite common for AM4 in my experience.,Neutral
AMD,"My brother went from 1700X to 3700X to 5800X3D on AM4, so 10 years next year? I plan on upgrading to 3D cpu probably 9600X3D once its out or maybe 7800X3D (something more affordable but still somewhat better). Kinda want better 1% lows tbh, but maybe I’ll just wait for next ones unsure.",Neutral
AMD,"How is it stupid? On one hand, intel sockets used only 3 gens from 12th-14th while on the other hand amd has not only used 7000-9000 but will also be using zen 6. I don't think you realize just how big of a hassle changing motherboards are",Negative

AMD,I originally had a Ryzen 5 3600 and am now on a 5700x3d so it’s pretty relevant I’d say. Of course it’s anecdotal but I don’t think it’s too uncommon,Neutral
AMD,"I agree with you, it’s daft, no doubt about it. But you’ve got to factor in that people can be daft too. Most tend to skimp, only to end up buying another middling CPU the following year, and then again after that. And so the cycle trundles on.  When I buy PC parts, I usually go for the best available. Provided the price is reasonably sane. I picked up a 9900K seven years ago and it’s still holding its own. Is it on par with the 9800X3D? Of course not. But it’s still a very capable bit of kit. Next time I upgrade, I’ll go top shelf again.",Neutral
AMD,"They frequently revisit products and test old hardware, but naturally that's not going to be their focus. Channels with that focus like RandomGaminginHD fill that niche.",Neutral
AMD,Sooo they are in the YouTube space for the money not for the love of tech,Neutral
AMD,"So true. After all they are reviewer, it's their job to revisit something if it's worth to benchmark due to improvements.   Didn't they said they want to educate their viewers? If so then why being lazy? This is obvious they just care about making big headline which makes more money for them. It's BS!",Negative
AMD,"If only the Arc B770 can beat the RX 9070XT with performance and features, then I definitely stay on Intel's side, but RN I doubt it",Neutral
AMD,"Even accepting that as true, I don’t think it changes the main point I was making. Arrow Lake has probably improved versus a year ago. It’s probably not as good as intel is making out. A good third party reviewer would be needed to determine by how much, yet it’s probably not worth their money and time to test it.   So the truth is probably in between what Intel is saying here and what the state of things was 6 months ago.",Negative

AMD,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets).

AMD,"Most commenters are wrong or didn’t read all the articles. Nvidia wants some custom SKUs of server chips to pair with its data center GPUs, and Intel wanted a better solution for pc parts for the GPU tiles.

Profit/earnings ratio of data center is even higher than the 10x.   In my opinion, the only reason for Intel to use RTX chiplets on pc parts is so they can have a few skus for mobile gaming. Lower end laptop chips would still use Xe cores.  This solves NONE of intel’s structural issues - they need, in this order  1. Major foundry customers  2. Regain server market share 3.

It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive. I know they have a lot of tricks up their sleeves still, like designing HBM memory onto the die (how Vega was supposed to be originally) and unified memory (soldered down, see the new AI branded chips).",Neutral
AMD,Ohh noooerrrrrrrrr,Neutral
AMD,"Actually this may be good for AMD and I will tell you why: Open source drivers. Nvidia if they had a say in intels graphics division would make the intel GPU stuff proprietary and locked down and when support ends its gonna hurt. Meanwhile AMD has open source drivers and in the age that linux is gaining popularity will make it the preferred platform for anyone interested in the growing linux ecosystem. Nvidia will NEED to change how they handle things or intel may not be as attractive as they once were, intel has already suffered a massive knock on thier reputation and this may be the mortal wound that can work in AMD's favor.",Neutral
AMD,"I don't see how this means anything at all for AMD in desktop. This is borderline irrelevant for desktop gaming. Most users pick up an Intel or AMD CPU and an NVIDIA dGPU.  APUs don't really exist in desktop gaming.  In mobile? I think most people won't care much. Intel and AMD APUs both offer compelling and reasonable alternatives for everyday usage. Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.  In all other cases I dont see this being a compelling option.",Neutral
AMD,So either a 200w igpu with a 300w intel cpu or an intel cpu with a 5030 slapped on it?  I think amd will be fine,Neutral
AMD,welcome to the Nvidia and amd duopoly,Neutral
AMD,"I’m really curious what the power efficiency ends up looking like here - mobile performance/W has continued to be very good in recent Intel platforms, and Nvidia is the market leader in that regard among gpu IHVs. But until now, Nvidia chips being intrinsically dGPUs has completely neutered any potential mobile power efficiency or handheld capability - but not anymore if such a thing can be a chiplet/tile! Interesting days ahead…",Positive
AMD,"By that time amd will have already made an FSR4 capbable handheld, so no significant change",Neutral
AMD,"It won’t affect either cause on parts that don’t need a nvidia igpu why raise the price with it when arc igpu is really good as is, maybe for the upper end they will have nvidia but what’s really stopping them from shipping one with an intel arc tile, gives customers more options and nvidia s Option may end up being more expensive",Neutral
AMD,a partnership doesnt mean they get free reign over license lol,Neutral

AMD,Why would it?,Negative
AMD,"It has nothing to do with the dgpu product stack. Nvidia makes very little from the diypc market. Way more comes from prebuilts, laptops and 90+% from data centers and other enterprise use. In a very real way, the arc cards are not a competitor to Nvidia.",Neutral
AMD,"Unfortunately no matter what given Intel's current state the division is going to suffer.

AMD,The market for Arc is the same as for Nvidia.,Neutral
AMD,Was that back in the MacBooks having the NVIDIA 9400m paired with a Core2Duo? Those were solid.,Positive
AMD,"No, but it is a reminder on shortcomings to watch out for. The Intel + AMD Partnership with the Intel NUCs several years ago made for some pretty compelling hardware. I still have a NUC8i7HVK in service which works like a champ.  If we are talking about current day NVIDIA with their Discrete Graphics (not the MX budget crap) then their GPUs are obviously smoking anything AMD and Intel. That doesn't resolve some of the Linux problems that still remain with NVIDIA, and that's not going to stop some of the BS NVIDIA does with their hardware around NVENC/NVDEC stream limits.

AMD,"Arc was already not doing well long before. Pouring millions into their gpu division every year with no returns.

Of course I think they also had much rosier projections for their other ventures when they started this journey, so who knows if the GPU losses are still tolerable.",Negative
AMD,Intel doesn't have a current gen A310 competitor either.,Neutral
AMD,Theres no way that nvidia is gonna let intel keep producing entry level gpus that directly compete with their own. I know their deals are in regards to apus and to compete with strix halo but nvidia is not gonna invest into a company with a competitor to their gpus.

AMD,IIRC that wss the AMD Turion X2 + NVIDIA 7300Go laptops. Those were notorious for dying.   I also remember some budget laptops with the Turion X2 + ATi 3200 chopsrt graphics would die due to graphics desoldering off the board. The GPU would sit at the end of the heatsink and burn up.   The 9400M MacBooks I remember would get hot enough to start leaving powder from the chassis on my desk lol.,Neutral

AMD,"They're already at 2, going on 3, generations of losses though (Intel discrete GPU's basically have 0 marketshare, even worse than AMD who are also doing really badly) so even if that were true that isn't a reason to be optimistic.  As a company they also seem to be desperate to get income as well and so there is no reason to assume they're going to tolerate that situation for all that much longer.    I doubt they'll entirely kill off their GPU division, they can still do iGPU's which will be good enough and cheaper than paying NV a royalty, but the discrete GPU line is clearly in trouble.",Negative

AMD,"3D cache will eventually become full of assets and dip, if and onlyif IMC is bottlenecked by random memory access.  - the ability for cache to transfer data from memory, to IMC, to cache has a FPS hit (cache hit-rate). This is due to the bottleneck of a chiplet-based IOD: compromising memory latency with cache hit-rate. Eventually the cache fills and relying on IMC to feed the cores anyway.  You can easily test this by monitoring 1% lows and increasing memory latency (lowering DDR4 B-die clocks/DDR5 hynix and increasing timings) to see how Cache holds up when full of assets while memory is being bottlenecked-   What games need is 10-12 P-Cores and an IMC capable of high speeds.

As for clocks, the core scales to max 5.2ghz (default 4.6ghz), certainly overall slower than Zen 4. IPC is a comparison about throughput at a given clockspeed. Its a give to compare you will need to match the clocks.  Funny you you should mention latencies, considering that core to core (even accross clusters), latencies of Skymont are better than Lion Cove? So if latency is the issue, it has nothing to do with Skymont and everything to do with the trash uncore they have based on the Meteorlake SOC. Even workstation Crestmont on a different package performs better. Furthermore skymont IPC is measured based on Arrowlake. Arrowlake is worse latency than Raptorlake and Zen already.

For the i9 they can have 4 such solitary E-cores that have their own cache and hence do not touch the L3 cache.

AMD,"It's capable of a few things, but the main mechanism from what I've seen is that it temporarily disables three out of four cores in each E-core cluster by forcing them into the lowest power state. The result is that the remaining active core has access to each cluster's full L2 cache (2MB on 12th-gen, 4MB on 13th/14th-gen). L2 cache isn't shared with P-cores (L3 is global), so this can really minimize E-core cache evictions before they're forced into slower memory, and games do love themselves some cache.  It's a genuinely clever way of maximizing available resources and I really wish they'd allow user control over its features, but it seems to be pretty tightly leashed to/by the team that developed it. It obviously wouldn't benefit every situation, such as particularly low/high thread occupancy situations, but it's pretty rough to have the option tied to quarterly updates for one or two specific games.",Neutral

AMD,"I never said it was better than X3D, only that it is useful as a foil.       Remember that Nova Lake will have bLLC, which is the answer to X3D.  But in conjunction with APO, it may give Intel the edge and help them regain the gaming crown in the next cycle provided they can streamline and expand the technology.",Positive
AMD,"Actually, it is better than X3D in almost every GPU/CPU combo where the GPU throttles. Intel 14th gen almost universally wins 1% lows and frequently FPS - almost universally in 4k gaming, but as I said, when the GPU throttles at any resolution, which is almost always, Intel wins.",Positive
AMD,"Eh, they're very good but they benefited vastly from AMDs mistakes and the lessons learned from it. Remember AMD didn't have any ai hardware for their first 2 gens on RDNA and RDNA 3 didn't have enough for FSR4 either. It's not that intel were better at producing a ML upscaler. They just had the hardware for it from the get go so they could implement it quicker.  They did make Xess though which is miles ahead of FSR 3 even on AMD systems (on average. FSR3 is pretty good when modded and can be competitive) so they do have some extremely talented people there. I hope they fund them properly and don't go the AMD route of having Ryzen and Radeon not work together due to pride.",Positive

AMD,Except its THE game devs job to optimize games for multiple cpus and gpus.,Neutral
AMD,It’s literally their job to do so? wtf you talking about?,Negative
AMD,AMD also has Heterogeneous CPUs and even more so ARM cpus.  Devs should start to do this optimizations to schedule the stronger cores.,Negative
AMD,"Will do, I got a 265K. Performance is already great tbh.",Positive
AMD,I love Intel but with how the company is doing right now I’m in a “I’ll believe it when I see it” type of skepticism.,Neutral
AMD,"Sorry I am making unreasonable requests. Can you test the game with APO on, and a few background tasks ? Like a few browser tabs, a youtube video playing, discord etc ? I am interested in the E-core usage, particularly the spread of E-core usage.   Thanks.",Neutral
AMD,"You need to enable it in the BIOS, me ale sure the DTT driver is installed and then download the app from the Windows 11 store",Neutral
AMD,"Which they already do, and are often overworked and underappreciated for.   But sure, it's their fault they didn't optimize the game even more for a subset of already relatively high end CPUs....",Negative
AMD,"You are massively oversimplifying. A lot of games that support APO, like Metro Exodus EE OP used as an example, were released before Intel released CPUs with P and E cores. Expecting studios to rework and optimize old games for new CPUs is very naive.",Negative
AMD,"They should be focusing on optimizations that help the vast majority of all CPUs, especially older/lower end ones.   It's not their job to specifically help one companies latest CPU architectures because they couldn't figure out how to create a core that has both good area and performance.",Negative

AMD,Thanks a lot.,Positive
AMD,> i am not talking about older games. i am talking about newer games.... really dude?  New games seldom have problems with P and E cores. That is why if you took at minute to look at games that APO support you would notice almost all were released before 2022 before release of Alder lake CPUs. Because older P and E unaware games struggle. Don't really dude me if you are this clueless.,Negative
AMD,"APO includes specific optimizations made for specific Intel skus, not general optimizations that help pretty much all processors.",Neutral
AMD,That is not true whatsoever. Games do not properly utilize the p and e cores and unreal 5 is very known for this.,Negative
AMD,Ok…? If there is a specific problem then they need to optimize it for that hardware. Literally a devs job. Still don’t get your thought process,Negative
AMD,"Dude, Unreal 5 runs like crap on pretty much all hardware. It stutters on AMD and nVidia graphics. Unreal 5 doesn't count.",Negative
AMD,"There isn't a specific problem, it still works lol, just not as well as it could on a specific architecture.   They shouldn't be wasting their finite resources/time on optimizing specifically for an already relatively high end and well performing architecture, but rather attempting more generalized optimizations that help all users.   It really shouldn't be too hard to understand.",Neutral
AMD,"Very cool. Cheers Intel! As a 6900XT owner, I use Xess whenever it's available. The DP4A version got very solid once V1.3 hit.  Hopefully more devs implement it.",Positive
AMD,"I like how Intel still support DP4A model. My meteor lake chip gonna love this XeSS2 with FG and LL.  Meanwhile Amd give middle finger to their consumer who don't have radeon 9000 series, FSR4 doesn't works at all on their previous GPU including the flagship rx 7000 series.",Positive
AMD,Did the DP4A version also improve from 1.3 to 2.0?,Neutral
AMD,"I thought it was a mix of both shader model 6.4+ and DP4a, not either or",Neutral
AMD,Okay but why would I want to use that instead of NVIDIA DLSS?,Neutral
AMD,It’s the least you should get after not getting FSR4.,Negative
AMD,You'd use it over FSR if that's available too?,Neutral
AMD,Except you NEVER got acces to the DP4a version tho. Intel cross vendor locked the DP4a path to their igpus and only allowed Shader Model 6.4 version for other gpus.,Neutral
AMD,"I don't want to defend AMD, but 7000 series lacks the FP8 instruction to hardware accelerate FSR4.   On Linux they managed to emulate it using the FP16 instruction, which is available on RDNA3, but it seriously impacts performance and introduces 1,5ms of input latency, compared to the 0,5/0,8ms of latency on RDNA4 with hardware FP8.",Negative
AMD,And they expect people who bought previous RDNA to buy more RDNA,Neutral
AMD,Not by a significant amount.,Neutral
AMD,DP4a only relevant for intel igpus as its crpss vendor locked by intel. Other gpus only get the Shader Model 6.4 version.,Neutral

AMD,It's great news for gpu that can't use dlss because fsr3 is a blurry shitfest.,Positive
AMD,"I mean it gives better image quality than FSR 3.1, so I know I definitely do.",Positive
AMD,Sure. The image quality is generally better. I'd only use FSR if I was trying to squeeze every last drop of performance out of my GPU since it's faster than Xess DP4a. But Xess will be tried first.,Positive
AMD,Do you have a link? Anything I have seen points to the GPU using Xess DP4A unless it's an ARC GPU. So it supports RDNA2 and newer on AMD and Turing and newer on Nvidia.  https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-xess-compatibility-nvidia-amd/  And I do literally run Xess on my 6900XT (currently using it for F7 Rebirth through Optiscaler). So if I'm not running Xess DP4a then what am I running?,Neutral
AMD,">I don't want to defend AMD, but 7000 series lacks the FP8 instruction to hardware accelerate FSR4   Sure, but they can make FSR4 for non hardware accelerated like Intel right? FSR 3.1 is so bad even when compared to Intel XeSS 1.3 DP4A, but Amd refuse to improve it because they want to force people to buy radeon 9000 series.",Negative
AMD,"Amd really all in when it comes to copying Nvidia. Guess what? The more you buy, the more you save!",Neutral
AMD,DP4a is cross vendor.   XMX is Arc only.,Neutral
AMD,DLSS is the widely adopted upscaler in the current market. I'd be shocked if a major game in 2025 releases without DLSS at the very least.,Neutral
AMD,1080ti heard no bell,Neutral
AMD,"You run the Shader Model 6.4 version which i stated. There was a discussiona bout DP4a being cross vendor locked but for the life of me i cannot find it again. The article you linked is from 2021, in early 2022 intel cross vendor locked DP4a. The main article of the post clearly states Shader Model 6.4.",Neutral
AMD,where did amd touch you bud?,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah more and more games are adding DLSS support, so I'm not sure when I would need Xess",Neutral
AMD,"That's true but in edge cases where even the lightest Xess option is still too heavy, FSR may still deliver a better overall experience.   E.g. CP2077 on the steam Deck in Dog Town. When I was testing some stuff out (trying to see how close I could get my Deck to the Switch 2 build) I found Xess to be a unsuitable. Even on the lightest Xess mode, the performance hit was a bit too noticeable. FSR doesn't look as good as Xess but it runs better and you can get away with a bit more upscaling artifacting on the Decks relatively small screen. Just rendering at a lower res and letting the screen upscale was also a solid option in that scenario.  As I say though, that's an edge case where you really just need outright speed. If your GPU doesn't support DLSS or FSR4 then using Xess makes sense in the vast majority of cases.",Neutral
AMD,Are you sure you're not getting the DP4A/Shader Model 6.4 and Arc exclusive version mixed up? DP4a was added to Shader Model 6.4. https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki/Shader-Model-6.4.  There is a separate path of Xess that is better than DP4A but that only works on Arc Cards.,Neutral
AMD,"It's good to see finally Intel working with game developer to bring optimization to Intel platform. This time not only optimization for Arc GPU, but also for Intel Core CPU like proper CPU scheduling for P and E cores to make sure the game runs on the right thread.  I think this also the reason why they never update APO game support again. Obviously optimizing their platform by working directly with game developer is better than doing it by themself.

AMD,"It's not like game runs bad on Intel CPU which has P and E cores, i will be lying if i say that. It's about maximizing CPU performance. CPU demanding game will runs with much higher FPS when it knows which thread should be utilized.    This is why game with APO enable like R6S on i9-14900K at 1080p low settings, it got performance increase up to 100FPS which is massive.",Neutral
AMD,"Most games are optimized for consoles which are natively eight cores, and a lot are ported over to PC and so you basically need eight fast cores in whatever CPU you happen to have, and the rest don't really do much. That's why Intel HEDT and AMD's Threadripper aren't of much use in this regard.",Neutral
AMD,"No, that's because and isn't really better for gaming unless you get their x3d variants. Those have a different style of memory that is better for gaming in particular but can underperform when it comes to workload tasks. Idk why 🤷",Negative

AMD,Wouldn't the 300 series actually be Arrow Lake Refresh?,Neutral
AMD,"Videocardz is wrong      This chip will likely be called ""Core Ultra 5 445k"" it's an 8+16 die with bLLC + 4LPe   (Not sure what suffix Intel will use to denote bLLC SKU maybe ""L"")    Ultra 3 has 4P + 4E + 4LPe  Ultra 5 has the 1x 8+16 tile + 4LPE   Ultra 7 has 8+6 P-Cores and 16+8 E-Cores +4LPe   Ultra 9 had 2x 8+16 tiles + 4LPe tile   Ultra 300 series will be reserved for mobile only Panther Lake and/or Arrow Lake Refresh   Ultra 400 will almost certainly be Nova Lake.",Neutral
AMD,I think this competition will tight up alot in the next gen for both intel and AMD.  Intel has had a superior memory controller for awhile now and AMD will finally address this in Zen 6.

AMD,If latency slightly increases or stays the same due to adopting Pantherlake optimizations and the newer Foveros then that might be enough to narrow the gap,Neutral

AMD,"Yes, but in games, it's the P-cores that are meant to be utilized. Also, more than eight cores or 16 threads aren't really necessary for gaming. The 9950x3d isn't faster, than the 9900x3d.  My point is that the space taken up by the E-cores could instead be used for additional cache, not?",Neutral
AMD,I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it. Anyhow if that's true the large L3 should be even more helpful for things like gaming as it will keep those higher latency hits down.

AMD,Process lasso can let you just designate by task so the E cores can do background and side jobs. People use process lasso on the 7950x3d to make the X3D chiplet run games with those 8 cores and the other 8 core chiplet for everything else.,Neutral
AMD,What issue did you run into with a 9800x3d? It has one CCD and no small cores,Neutral
AMD,"Nowadays there are very few cases where disabling E cores is extremely beneficial, sometimes they are a detriment to performance but more often than not they are useful. Not to mention the E core design team is more competent than the P core team and are quickly catching up in performance.    The E cores in Alder Lake had relatively poor ST performance but in Arrow Lake they are much faster and closer to the P cores in raw performance. Every new generation the gap keeps shrinking and it will make the disabling of E cores less and less relevant.    Sometimes the Windows scheduler will wrongly assign an E core to a ST bound task, even if a P core is available, but it doesn't happen often enough to be a serious issue.",Neutral
AMD,"yes, but not because of windows scheduling - its because you can OC higher with them off - better temps and easier stability - some people disable HT for the same.",Negative
AMD,They don't pay attention,Neutral
AMD,"No. Intel needs to do what Amd did and add seperate bLLC just for gaming. As long as latency is reduced to the L3 cache including bLLC, gaming performance will definitely increase as 285K and 9950x have similar performance in both gaming and productivity with small lead going to Amd. But x3d totally dominates ARL beacsue of the obvious huge cache difference and lower overall latency to their cache implementation.",Neutral

AMD,How do you think they're doing 2 compute tiles if the memory controller is on one?,Neutral
AMD,">I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it.  I'm curious, which leakers have said otherwise?   You could still have mem latency improvements without the mem controller being on the compute tile too, so the situation there can improve either way.   >AMD has always had higher latency due to the same kind of design with a separate memory controller so we have pretty good data on how extra cache can help  Yup, and ARL has higher mem latency than AMD even, so obviously there is room to improve even without having to move the mem controller back.",Neutral

Just a couple days ago we had a [report](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250724PD213/tsmc-2nm-capacity-2028-3nm.html) about TSMC being very aggressive with N2 scale out, and the reasoning here is two fold- first of all, 2026 is technically the 2nd year of N2 HVM, and also because a *lot* of major SOCs, other than just Apple and AMD, will be on N2- demand for N2 is high, and build out will be too.",Neutral

AMD,"Yes but IF Intel decides to do quad channel for AI nonsense at least for flagship model, Amd threadripper will be stomped over as I will definitely buy the Nova Lake part just for the price/performance compared to 9960x threadripper. The motherboard selection alone for Z890 is absolutely amazing and RDIMM prices aretwice as expensive for the same amount of memory. I expect with CAMM2 that max ram capaciity will go for 512GB and maybe 1TB for Nova Lake aswell.

AMD,"I don't recall Intel stating that NVL core chips would be at TSMC, only that some of the eventual package would be... which implies iGPU, to me, and that wouldn't be N2 (possibly N4, since Battlemage is N5, and N4 would be open and cheaper than N3 nodes).  Do you have a source, where they directly claim the NVL cores are coming from TSMC?",Neutral
AMD,"The game is a dumpster fire when it comes to CPU utilization, it hammers even top tier gaming chips like the 9800X3D. I'm not surprised if the E cores can bottleneck the performance even further, most likely some of the game's heaviest threads get (wrongly) assigned to the E cores.    The scheduling in W11 has been significantly improved over the last few years but it's not 100% perfect either. Legacy software in particular, which typically utilizes 1 core, often ends up running in an E core and as a result you can't take advantage of the higher ST performance a P core provides. In that case you need stuff like Process Lasso to fix the problem. It doesn't happen very often but when it does it's very annoying.",Negative

AMD,"Wonder what node such a product, if it does exist, would use for the iGPU tile.   AFAIK, rumor is that the iGPU tile for the standard parts would be on 18A or an 18A variant. However, if this is a flagship part, I would assume they would be willing to pay the extra cost to use N2...   However that would also presumably involve porting the architecture over to another node, which I don't think Intel has the resources, or wants to go through the effort, to do so.   Also wonder if such a product will finally utilize the ADM cache that has been rumored since like, forever.   And this is a bit of a tangent, but I swear at this point in the leak cycle for a new Intel product, there's always usually a ton of different skus that are leaked that may or may not launch - right now we have NVL bLLC, NVL standard, and now this, and a bunch of them end up not launching (whether they were cut internally, or the leaks were just made up). So it would be pretty interesting to see if any of the more specialized rumored NVL skus end up actually launching.",Neutral

AMD,The 7850HS can't compete with the Xe2 igpu because it's bandwidth starved.   The 8mb of memory side cache insulating the 4mb of L2 from main memory allows the Xe2 Arc 140V igpu in LL clocked at 1950mhz to beat the RDNA 3.5 890m clocked at 2950mhz as it only has 4mb of L2 as a last level of cache before hitting memory.

AMD,"The low volume part of that quote is important. If you're making heaps of them, each can take up a little bit of the startup costs for that design. If you only make a few, those costs get concentrated on what you do make.  Low volume also means a single defect is promotionally more of your possible units, and hits the margins harder. You do get more total defects in a larger run, but at sufficiently high quantities of those defects, you start making lower bins to recover some of the defects. If you hardly make the volume to cover one widespread SKU, you aren't likely to have enough to make a cheaper one with any degree of availability. At some point you hit a threshold where it's not worth selling what would be a lower bin because there's not enough of them.",Neutral

AMD,"Even though it's not stacked, I believe it's still going to fix the last level cache latency issue MTL and ARL have.   Ryzen CPUs have lower L3 latency than Intel because each CCX gets their own independent L3, unlike Intel's shared L3. Now in NVL, the BLLC configuration will replace half of the P-core and E-core tiles with L3, so possibly giving the existing cores/tiles their own independent L3, improving latency and bandwidth over shared L3.  But one thing intrigues me. If this cache level has lower latency than shared L3, wouldn't this more properly be called L2.5 or something below L3 rather than last level cache? Will NVL even still have shared L3 like the previous Intel CPUs? I know the rumor that it will have shared L2 per two cores, but we know nothing of the L3 configuration.",Neutral

AMD,"Sooo a few months ago, I helped a buddy of mine troubleshoot a black screen issue on his newly built 9800X3D and RTX 5090 rig, a fairly common issue with Nvidia’s latest GPUs.  While working on his PC, I'd notice a series of odd and random hiccups. For example, double clicking a window to maximize it would cause micro freezes. His monitor runs at 240Hz, and the cursor moves very smoothly, but dragging a window around felt like it was refreshing at 60Hz. Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.  I did my due diligence on his AMD setup: updated the BIOS and chipset drivers, enabled EXPO profile, made sure Game Bar was enabled, set the power mode to Balanced. Basically, all the little things you need to do to get the X3D chip to play nice and left.  But man... I do not want to ever be on an AMD system.",Neutral

AMD,"Now both AMD and Intel chips are “disaggregated “ which means between cpu and other agents like memory controllers, pcie, and storage there is higher latency than the 12/13/14th gen parts. AMD has higher latency due to the larger distances involved on the package.  Also Intel is not really improving the CPU core much. There won’t be a compelling reason to upgrade from a 14700 until DDR6 comes out. At least not in desktop. Nova lake high cache parts will cost $600 or more so value/dollar will be low.",Negative

X3D just performs great out of the box because of the huge L3 Cache. At the very least if you do not like microstutters or frame drops and want consistent gaming performance Intel 14th gen is superior vs current AMD's offering. Anyone with a specific board like Apex, Lightning, Tachyon, or even Gigabyte Refresh boards + i7/i9 13-14th gen with decent memory controller can achieve similar gaming experience.

AMD,"That channel has a lot of videos and even on this specific video it would help if you point the specific time you're referring to.  Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.  So by virtue of their fast memory Macs are easily 3x to 8x faster than PC on LLMs.  The rest is quite different though which is why what benchmark is important.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm highly suspicious, for packaging reasons if nothing else. I'm not going to call it impossible, but that would put enormous strain on the X dimension.

I'm a dev, I want my code to be the fastest on all platforms  I have: - M4 Max so I can optimize on ARM and MacOS - Ryzen 9950X so I can optimize with AVX512 - in the process of buying an Intel 265K so I can tune multithreaded code to heterogeneous architecture.  The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough. So I expect the next-gen CPUs (Zen 6 and Nova Lake) to be quad-channel by default (~200GB/s with DDR5) so they are at least in the same ballpark as M4 chip (but still 2x slower than M4 Pro and Max).  I also expect more soldered LPDDR5 builds in the coming year.",Neutral

AMD,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.  The whole experience is proving to be awful, time consuming, feels like it should be illegal and has completely put me off ever using Intel again, or recommending it to anyone I help spec builds for.",Negative

AMD,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.

Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.

AMD,So what is the QVL list for x299 VROC? I can’t find that information. I can find QVL for C621,Neutral
AMD,"So I was able to download the files from the RDC. Currently when I run        eeupdate64e.efi /NIC=2 /DATA Dev_Start_I210_Copper_NOMNG_4Mb_A2.bin  It says ""Only /INVM* and /MAC commands are valid for this adapter. Unsupported."" This is for three 8086-1531 Intel(R) I210 Blank NVM Device. Presumably in order to program them with device id 1533, I need to run a different command or use a different tool?  Thank you for your help, I feel like it is very close to working.  Edit: I believe it works, using /INVMUPDATE",Neutral
AMD,"[This is literally what I am dealing with.](https://imgur.com/a/WBowyjO)  I'm not even worried about posting this image because please tell me how to get a better photo than this with a regular smart phone, and you can barely see there's anything there.",Negative
AMD,"Yes, I've turned off the system animations, and the blinking cursors.  There aren't settings to switch fonts, to replace thin/faint fonts with bold ones. The folks developing Windows like Segoe Ui, maybe they can read it. There are regedit hacks, but I'm not sure how to do them. There is also Winaero Tweaker, which can switch some fonts, but doesn't work on some older apps with unreadable text. There is MacType, which can bolden text without switching fonts, but doesn't work everywhere either.  There are settings to scale fonts, or scale everything, or reduce resolution. I've tried every combination of these. I've reduced resolution, since it does work everywhere. But I can't go below 1280x720, and I end up breaking some interfaces anyway. There is also the magnifier, but it gives me a migraine.  Here's the thing. If text is too thin/faint, making it 2x as bold will take less than 2x the screen space; making it 2x as big will take 4x the screen space.  I'm surprised how well tweaking gamma has worked. So far it has worked everywhere with dark text on light images, and it's worked very well.",Negative
AMD,I'm now on the new BIOS (with Intel default settings) and the crashing is still occurring on Core 8. Alas... I was really hoping that would fix it.  What are the next steps?,Negative
AMD,"u/Hippieman100 Ah, I see I overlooked that part! Looks like this is the installer version, my apologies for the confusion since we were discussing three different software options earlier.  Alrighty, since you're using the latest version now, how can I help? Are you running into any issues with the new application, or is there a specific feature that's not working as expected?",Neutral
AMD,"u/TheCupaCupa Great to hear it fixed itself! If it happens again, trying Turbo off sounds like a good plan.",Positive
AMD,"u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  You're encountering a common issue, Intel doesn't maintain a centralized QVL (Qualified Vendor List) specifically for X299 VROC at the platform level. Since X299 is a consumer chipset, the VROC compatibility lists were typically maintained by individual motherboard manufacturers rather than Intel directly. The C621 QVL you found is for Intel's server/workstation chipset, which has more formal validation processes. For X299 VROC compatibility, you'll need to check with your specific motherboard manufacturer (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, etc.) as they would have maintained their own compatibility lists during VROC's active period. However, since X299 VROC is now in sustaining mode, many manufacturers may no longer actively update these lists. Your best bet is to search for your specific motherboard model's support page or contact the manufacturer directly, though given the discontinued status, this information may be limited or archived.",Neutral
AMD,Relax 😅 and follow this:https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005609/processors.html,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah switching fonts, I haven't tried it. But in windows settings you can change its size and such. Try looking at the Microsoft community or support changing it. But I am glad that adjusting the gamma helps.",Negative

AMD,"Thank you for the reply. Sadly asrock doesn’t have a QVL for nvme drives in U.2 form factor or enterprise grade drives, just m.2. Let alone a QVL for VROC support. Looks like I’ll be the test subject for this.",Negative
AMD,"That is what I'm following, I provided support everything on that list, including decoding the matrix on the front of the chip but they don't proceed with the ticket until they get a picture of the code on the pcb which is nigh on impossible.  I wound up taking it into the office to use a high resolution scanner thats used to digitise paintings and just about got something readable. I remain firm in my stance that whilst wanting to verify a serial number isn't outrageous, making the process in which you verify said information virtually impossible is.   I simply don't understand how regular people can take such a detailed photo using smartphone technology. My phone is 4 years old and was absolutely not capable (Samsung S20+)",Negative
AMD,u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  **Best of luck with your configuration!** Your pioneering work might just pave the way for others looking to implement similar setups.,Positive
AMD,"u/Danderlyon  **just sent you a message, check your inbox when you get a chance!**",Neutral
AMD,"Just wanted to follow up for anyone seeing this or is in a similar boat. I can confirm that Intel DC P4510 drives will work in a VROC Raid using a standard key.      Not sure if intel support can confirm but it appears the ASROCK X299 Taichi CLX supports VROC Raid across multiple VMD Domains, which is supposed to be locked behind Xeon scalable CPU/Chipsets. I need to buy two more drives and try to add them to my array to confirm.",Neutral
