Intel,Spoiler. Yes is a new variant but it is call B70 arc pro series  Not the B770 we want,Neutral
Intel,"Performance wise, how what nvidia series card will it compare to?",Neutral
Intel,Celestial or maybe even Druid was supposed to be out in 2025 at one point.   https://www.techpowerup.com/292208/intel-targeting-2024-for-ultra-enthusiast-arc-celestial-gpus,Neutral
Intel,"I'm sure B770 will launch as a side-effect if G31, but the real reason is for a low cost (relative) 32GB pro card to target AI. (Called B70?)  If Intel can offer 32GB VRAM on the pro card for $1000, it would be hugely popular within it's specific niche. And it's most important job is to get it into the hands of AI hobbyists to build out software support OneAPI in the open source AI community.  G31 isn't going to revolutionize the gaming market. It won't revolutionize Intel's finances. But it's goal is going to be high-VRAM at a low cost to try and build out alternatives to CUDA.   It's just a shame that it couldn't have come at a worse time from a cost-structure POV",Neutral
Intel,What niche is this going to fill? Battlemage was already kinda iffy performance wise when the B580 launched. It really had to compete with its increased VRAM and low price. Performance is going to be aged even more now. I imagine it’ll lose to a 5060ti or at best a 5070. Obviously price is king but I don’t see this generation being performance competitive.,Negative
Intel,Curious to see if they can actually compete this time.,Neutral
Intel,"Oh, Intel, the *timing*...",Neutral
Intel,"As always too late - it's hard to compete when launching mid-late AMD/nvidia generation. Also curious how CPU driver head will reflect on much more powerful card, because it's still not quite resolved based of B580 tests.  Something like RX 9070 has very good pricing, especially in Europe, then RTX 5070 is very popular too. They would need to price it under 500€, likely closer to 450€ to have decent appeal, and I don't know if that's possible.",Negative
Intel,Wondering when we'd start hearing CES stuff.,Neutral

Intel,With how insane RAM shit has gone. These stock oils were bought long long ago. It won’t be in stock like… at all. Ever.,Negative
Intel,I thought they had given up on higher-end items. Will the die size be as large as the G10 (406 mm^2 )?,Neutral
Intel,"I might be interested in buying one of these, if it's priced right.",Positive
Intel,Id sell my 4070ti super and move to this if it releases,Neutral
Intel,For me the sweet spot would be 5070ti performance with 32gb vram,Positive
Intel,"Watch it end up being AI-focused, without graphics output, and part of the Flex family.",Neutral
Intel,"1.6x the cores, but only 1.33x the memory bus with maybe 5% faster RAM is like 1.4x the bandwidth.   So I'd guess 1.5x the B580 at best.  Which puts it below an RTX 4070.",Neutral
Intel,"4070, 4070 Super at best (5070).",Positive
Intel,"b580 looks to use around 170W, this new card has a TDP of 300W so assuming the same efficiency and it uses the full 300W it'll be up to 1.76x the speed putting it between 4070 and 5070.",Neutral
Intel,This must be the “4080 performance” RedGamingTech has been mentioning since 2020 /s,Neutral
Intel,"1.6 times the number of cores, 1.5 times the power draw compared to the B580. Let's say 1.4 to 1.6 times faster than the B580. That puts it at approximately the 5060ti to 4070 level.",Neutral
Intel,Nobody knows yet  I guess between 5060 ti and 5070,Neutral
Intel,vaguely 4070-5070 ish,Neutral
Intel,"we're not sure yet, its theorised to be around 5070-5070ti or 9070/xt but if intel does what they do with the b580 it'll completely destroy them on value, let's hope the ram issue doesn't kill what was shaping up to be the best gpu in recent time. the b580 is delightful.  intel 140t/v and b580 gained like a cumulative 20% perf boost this year just from drivers alone",Neutral
Intel,People are saying \~4070 at a lower cost. Intel GPUs are still space inefficient compared to Nvidia (so is AMD) so them dumping a lot of power into the chip is probably the best way for them to keep costs down.,Neutral
Intel,"Intel has so far shown to match Nvidia regarding RT performance per dollar but not ""real"" performance per watt against AMD.  As their last flagship was kinda matched into AMD 5700XT and Nvidia RTX 2070, but like 5 years too late.",Neutral
Intel,5060 Ti 16gb to 4070 Super range.,Neutral
Intel,That roadmap was always laughable.,Neutral
Intel,> If Intel can offer 32GB VRAM on the pro card for $1000  If you can even find the card.  It’s bad enough that I just went with an AMD R9700 instead of waiting for the B60 or its 48GB dual variant to show up.,Negative
Intel,"Realistically? None. This is a long-term play for Intel. They know the real money's in datacenters, but the ramp up to get there now is a decade+ with how complex modern GPUs are. They're just putting a few consumer products out there to establish the product line along the way.",Neutral
Intel,It'll be priced in the 5060ti range but offer better performance. AMD doesn't offer a product at that price.,Neutral
Intel,"Where are likely a year and a half to the next Nvidia consumer cards releasing.  Assuming things like memory shortage goes away at that time, or else they might even Delay it even more.",Neutral
Intel,"To be fair, if the Nvidia super launch is cancelled then this could maybe fill a place for the 5070 super",Neutral
Intel,"> because it's still not quite resolved based of B580 tests.  And it probably never will be, since a large part of it is architectural.  AMD never solved the GCN single thread bottleneck in DX11 either.",Negative
Intel,"Not sure how it is mid-late this cycle, new Nvidia cards aren't expected till 2027, with AMD *maybe* releasing late 2026. We're really not even halfway this gen.",Negative
Intel,"Rumors were that it wasn't gonna come out. Something changed in the market to make Intel resume releasing G31.   And I'm convinced that's the fact that B70 could disrupt the market *(the market being the relatively small but growing home AI market - don't underestimate the impact this market can have on software stack support in professional environments)  As for the gaming side of things, I guess we'll find out if the driver overhead is a fixed amount or one that increases with the card's performance.",Neutral
Intel,"Maybe, if it comes out soon it will be a better value than both potentially.",Positive
Intel,Nvidia released RTX 30 Series in 2020 on a variant of Samsung's 10nm.,Neutral
Intel,All about price points.,Neutral
Intel,"Aside from the architecture not existing back then, the tech is a lot cheaper now than it was then. Not using bleeding edge hardware is a good thing for a budget card.",Positive
Intel,"You’ll end up with the same performance on the games Intel optimized the drivers for, worse performance on everything else, and no DLSS.",Negative
Intel,Why? You already have a superior GPU.,Neutral
Intel,The 4070Ti Super is literally a beast of a card. It's between the >RX 9070 and <5070Ti in rasterization and a cutdown of 4080/S,Positive
Intel,"No way in hell it'll be anywhere near that with only 32 Xe cores, it's looking like 5060Ti at best, and only if they can get it to scale well",Negative
Intel,That'd be a weird thing to show off at CES.,Neutral
Intel,Flex was killed.,Neutral
Intel,"That’s the relatively unobtainable Arc Pro B60 24gb and its unicorn tier 48gb dual model, save for the lack of Flex branding.",Neutral
Intel,It's not going to be linear with power. Core count and especially memory bandwidth are not scaling to that degree.,Neutral
Intel,"that would be an excellent sweet spot for sales. more than most anyone needs to play games, but not excessive.",Positive
Intel,Haven't seen them on my youtube feed in a long time.  I prefer to get all my fake rumors from MLID.,Negative
Intel,That was a rumored XE3 card. Not sure if it'll come.,Neutral
Intel,The rumor when B580 was coming out was that this should be a 4070 competitor. Don't tell people this will be anywhere close to a 5070ti lol; that'll undermine any chance of Intel having success with this card real quick.,Negative
Intel,\>5070ti or 9070/xt   Absolutely and utterly out of the question,Neutral
Intel,They can probably just make the money back for launching the larger die from cranking out 32GB professional cards.     Wouldn't be surprised if what they launch for consumers is a slightly cut down version.,Neutral
Intel,isnt that to prove one being reliable GPU maker to datacenter client; they have to let their product out in consumer market long enough to build that reputation?,Neutral
Intel,"Because ""that price"" is iGPU range.",Neutral
Intel,Intel will also end up being a year and a half out of date shipping another non-competitive entry level enterprise card.,Negative
Intel,"And by the time B770 drops, gonna be April / May. It's gonna be mid-gen as fuck",Negative
Intel,"Fuck, it's already been half a decade.",Negative
Intel,And apple launched m1 mac on tsmc 5nm in 2020,Neutral
Intel,If this can match the 4070ti super (>5070) in any gpu bottlenecked game that would be a huge success. Probably impossible given that this only has 32 Xe cores,Neutral
Intel,"My guess is that'll outperform 5060ti at higher resolutions, but trade blows and maybe even be slightly slower at lower resolution.",Neutral
Intel,Local llm focused COULD make sense. But yeah not ces likely,Neutral
Intel,Exactly why I think it's more likely than them releasing a B770.,Neutral
Intel,Been waiting for the B60 to be commonly available here and it’s more rare than the 5090 FE,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, depending on the price it could be the perfect 1440p card.",Positive
Intel,"b770 has shown up in benchmarks with 16gb gddr6 and double the CUs so that's why i gave a range, it means it is going to fall between those probably with lower spec being realistic and higher optimistic.  itd possibly be better for the consumer if it was 5070 spec and 16gb since it would be a killer affordable 1440p card with potential to do entry 4k and the community needs value right now.  if it competes with high mid range it will probably cost a ton. if they can do this card under 500 its going to be insane value. my wife and i think it'll be 500-600(msrp) but of course scalpers will do their thing",Neutral
Intel,Really all they need to do is provide a better card than the 9060xt and the 5060ti. If it's $370 it will crush the competition.,Neutral
Intel,AMD's iGPUs on the high end were like 4060 equivalent last I remember hearing. But the price was also reflective of that.,Neutral
Intel,That's because only Apple  has early access to TSMC most advanced node.,Neutral
Intel,I’d bet that equivalent generation Quadros or Radeon Pro cards are far easier to find at any price much less near MSRP or even introductory MSRP.,Neutral
Intel,"I mean honestly a 5070 is fully playable even at 4k,",Positive
Intel,I keep wondering if Apple will get everything together to actually make a gaming alternative.  They are throwing enough die space at it seemingly.,Neutral
Intel,"The total worldwide gaming market is $400 billion, about equal to Apple's yearly revenue, and only 4x Apple's yearly profit.  They will invest the minimum in the one gaming cash cow they have (iPhone) and ignore the rest, as usual.",Neutral
Intel,"Apple iPhones run games better than Android. You will need to manually tweak your Android device a lot to match performance. I doubt they can compete against laptop gaming, both in terms of price and performance (battery doesn't matter here), but they are better over Android in that space.",Positive
Intel,"They make excellent gaming devices, that's more on developers avoiding them for whatever reasons. The closed shop nature doesn't help either, they really should keep the closed stuff as a premium brand and release a new brand of more open arm hardware. They could probably make a killer handheld at a minimum.",Positive
Intel,Apple is a large player in the *total* gaming market through iOS,Neutral
Intel,I was thinking of proton on macOS that correctly uses metal.  Maybe that could happen?  Granted it adds x86 compatibility to the mix but it’s not like they did not already address that….,Neutral
Intel,"Interesting results. If this is representative for consumer laptops, Panther Lake is a much bigger upgrade than most here, including me, expected. But it almost seems too good to be true somehow.",Positive
Intel,is Geekbench a CPU or a GPU benchmark?,Neutral
Intel,"Is Intel just ""squeezing the toothpaste"" again ? Even a low-frequency single-core 288V gets 2,700+ on Geekbench, while the 285H gets 2,600+ in single-core and 14,785 on multi-core. Therefore, TL;DR: I don't see Panther Lake being a huge improvement over the current Alder/Arrow Lake pairing. We will have to wait and see the power consumption, though.",Neutral

Intel,How does this compare to the Snapdragon X2 Elite?,Neutral
Intel,"I have carefully compared the various models across Geekbench, PassMark, and the differences between Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake. If my judgment is correct, the theoretical peak performance of the 484 in Cinebench R23 should reach around **24,500**; the 285H scores **22,500**. Compared with the 285H, it should be easier for the 484 to achieve high scores because its power requirements are significantly lower than the previous generation built on TSMC N3B.  Its peak performance will not be extremely strong because the frequency is not high. IPC is likely improved by around **10–11%**, but clock speeds drop by about **6%**. Overall, that means single-core performance should only rise by **4–5%**.  The improvement will be most noticeable in Geekbench. Since PassMark single-core also shows gains, the IPC uplift and resulting single-core increase should be quite certain. If Geekbench were the only source, it would still be questionable, but PassMark is more solid and has higher reference value.  Overall, in terms of peak performance, the uplift is average—around **10%**, close to that figure.  However, the real key is the **efficiency gains**. I believe they will be excellent. Compared with the 285H, which requires **65 W** to reach **20,000** points in Cinebench R23, I estimate that the **388H** may only need **40–45 W**.  I also estimate that the Cinebench R24 score should fall around **1300–1400**. Compared with Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 at **1950**, there is still a significant gap—but the two products differ drastically in scale.  Overall, Panther Lake’s greatest achievements lie in several aspects:  1. **Energy efficiency** — likely the best among all x86 products. 2. **Performance per mm²** — excellent. For example, the 484: if you look at its die shot, the total area of the CPU (including the CPU tile’s 4P and 4 LPE cores and all caches) is essentially equal to the die area of a traditional monolithic 8-core design. That means the 484 uses the same silicon resources as past 8-core chips, yet **no AMD mobile 8-core processor surpasses it**, either in raw performance or efficiency. 3. It also offers better performance-per-area than Qualcomm’s processors. The X Elite 2 has **18 cores**, including **12 “very large” cores**—similar in size to Intel P-cores—and **6 large cores**, each larger than Intel’s E-cores. The die area of this chip is **2.5× larger** than Panther Lake 484’s.",Neutral

Intel,"Geekbench’s scaling has always been problematic, and the differences between architectures are huge. The benchmark is very friendly to ARM and least favorable to AMD.

The only valid reference is **same-generation, same-architecture comparisons**, such as between the 285H and 388H.  Based on the actual results, the improvements are about **9% in single-core** and **21% in multi-core**. Given that the 285H scores around **22,500** in Cinebench, I estimate that the 388H should be able to reach roughly **24,000**.  But the key point is **power efficiency at lower power limits**. For example, if the 285H needs around **80W** to reach 22,500, then the real question is:  * How much power does the 388H need to reach 22,500? * How many watts does it take to exceed 20,000?  This is what really matters. If the 388H can achieve 2**0,000 at 35W**, **22,500 at 60W**, and **24,000 at 80W**, then that would represent massive progress.

Intel,"It’s obvious that this is the viewpoint of an outsider. Professionals would never look at it this way. Professionals first evaluate a processor based on its specifications, features, and process technology. Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake are *not* using some outdated process — they use TSMC’s then-most-advanced N3B node, Intel’s first time adopting it. Meanwhile, Panther Lake uses Intel’s own **18A** process.  Based on the current benchmark results, Intel’s 18A appears to outperform TSMC’s N3B by at least the same margin that **Intel 4** trailed behind N3B — which is an astonishing result.  Every day you hear people saying how much TSMC has advanced, how far ahead its processes are, how “outdated” Intel’s nodes are, how AMD’s processors using TSMC have excellent efficiency. These kinds of statements have been repeated endlessly over the past decade.  Yet today, Intel is using its newest process node to **clearly surpass** TSMC’s top process from just one year ago.",Neutral
Intel,"Good question. I have carefully examined both sides as well. The 388H corresponds to the 484 configuration. From the die shot, the total CPU area — including all caches — is almost the same size as a traditional 8-P-core design.  Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 has two SKUs: one with 12 cores and another with 18 cores. Both have a larger die size than the 388H.  The 12-core version consists of **6 “ultra-large” cores** (Qualcomm’s terminology) plus **6 large cores**. In practice, this is equivalent to Intel having 6 P-cores plus 6 cores that are somewhere between a P-core and an E-core in size. Its die size is roughly equal to **10 Intel P-cores**.  The 18-core version has **12 ultra-large cores** plus **6 large cores**, with a die size roughly equal to **16 Intel P-cores**.  In terms of product performance, using Cinebench R24 as the standard, the 18-core X Elite 2 scores about **1960 points at 100 W**, while the 12-core version scores about **1350 points at 80 W**.  Based on the current Geekbench and PassMark results for Panther Lake, my assessment is that overall multicore performance is **10–15% higher** than the 285H. That suggests the 388H should also be able to reach **around 1350 points at 80 W**.",Neutral
Intel,"the real test will be how many watts the X9 388H needs to achieve its scores, because the 285HX needed like 90 watts to achieve its scores  so if the X9 could hit its scores while on its base TDP (65 watts) then thats a \~40% increase in efficiency, not bad",Neutral

Intel,It runs for far too short a time to reflect accurate multi-core performance.  People don't get a multitude of cores to run a task for a few seconds.

When it refreshes the tree it asks connected devices if they are online, including the HDDs. Now move the window back and forth between your screens.

To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.  Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.  A think that in 2028 big APU solutions can compete well against XX50 series and most XX60 cards.  It isn't happening before then however.",Negative

Intel,this GPU is also coming into the 355H btw (more specifically there's a Ultra X7 version of the 355H with the full 12-core GPU)     and iirc last time the 255H was pretty popular,Neutral
Intel,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.  EDIT: 8060S (Strix Halo) is \~18,000 for reference.  EDIT 2: 890M (strix point's top end) about 8,100, so the PTL 12Xe chip will smoke that.

Intel,IMO it's probably not economical for them to do it.   Gaming laptops/handhelds are already niche enough as it is -- doesn't make sense for them to package both and for OEMs to carry both for just for a ~$1-200 delta between the units. Those who want the full GPU will just pay for it.,Negative
Intel,"You gotta remember these CPU’s don’t have multi-threading. AMD gets 16 threads out of their 8 core z1 and z2 extreme but with these core ultra’s you get one core and that’s it. A full on physical core is better than a virtual core, but the same amount of cores with multi-threading is much better than just a same core-count CPU without it. Intel are offering up to 16 cores which is 16 cores/16 threads, but generally should offer better multi-core performance vs an 8-core 16-thread. If anything it’s nice Intel have the ability to improve core count offerings without significantly raising the power requirements.

Well, we already had rumors of Intel struggling to hit actual intended frequency-goals, no?  Though especially the actual performance-metrics of the node will be quite sobering I think.  The power-draw of these SKUs is supposed to be a TDP of *officially* 25W – In reality, these parts are allowed to draw as much as 55W (2+0+4 or 4+0+4) and 65/80W (4+4+4 and 4+8+4) respectively.  So it must be seen, if these parts are any more efficient in daily usage, or just a side-grade to Lunar Lake.",Neutral
Intel,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power. A 10-15% frequency advantage would go a long, long way towards closing gaps if it comes as a relatively small power cost.",Neutral

Intel,Since when is any user determining what cores they want to use and when?,Neutral
Intel,It makes sense to have three as the low-power cores prioritize keeping the power consumption low for battery life but to achieve this they aren't attached to the ring bus which hurts performance so 8 regular E cores are also used,Neutral
Intel,">I can't say I'm entirely sold on the idea of having three core clusters humming inside my laptop.  From a user's perspective, CPU's are a blackbox and the inner-working details are irrelevant. What matters is results. They want, typically, a balance of performance, battery life, heat / fan noise, and cost, placing greater emphasis on one of these categories over the others.  The idea is that P cores = performance optizied  E cores = Area optimized  LP-E Cores = power optimized.  The theory being to have different core types focus on different parts of PPA.  E cores and LP-E cores are the same microarchitecture. Just LP-E cores are off-ring so the ring (and rest of the cores) can be powered down in light-load scenarios.  Intel's biggest problem is that looking at each of the cores, the P cores perform their designated role the worst. 200% larger than E cores for \~10% more IPC and \~15% more clockspeed is a pretty rough trade off - and by the time you've loaded all P cores and need to load E cores too, that clockspeed difference diminishes hard.  Intel's better off (and all rumors point this way) to growing the E cores slightly and making that architecture the basis of the new P and E cores (like Zen vs Zen-C)",Neutral

Intel,"Jaykihn attributes only density to the supposed heat issues, not BSPD.

Intel,"18A has always been low density, but expected to compensate for it with very efficient frequency scaling past peak perf/W. It was always going to struggle in laptops, where you rarely push past the best perf/W due to thermal and battery constraints.  Wait for the desktop/server chips before you call it. With fewer thermal constraints and much higher power budgets, they should be able to push well past the perf/W peak, where it should continue to scale well and for a long time before it starts hitting severely diminishing returns.  I'm not talking 300W monster CPUs, but the scaling between a 65W and 105W 18A CPU should be more significant than on current nodes, where you might gain like 10-15% additional performance from that 50% power bump.

Intel,"I actually suspect otherwise - speculation on my part, but I suspect that they were running into unexpected process issues when they pumped the frequency and/or voltage higher so they had to scale back performance.  It almost feels like a process bug that they discovered when making the actual chips.  They've also talked about kind of weak yields on 18A on their latest earnings call.  That makes me optimistic about the improvement opportunity in a more mature 18A if they can chase down these issues, and perhaps even more in 18AP if they can clean up these bugs.  If they have a 'double upgrade' opportunity in both fixing the discovered 18A issues and implementing the originally planned 18AP improvements then it could end up being a somewhat bigger jump.  Don't think it'll be an N2 beater though.  18AP *might* beat the best of N3 in some applications, we'll see.  For that you'd want to look ahead to 14A where the CFO mentioned on the earnings call (and he was somewhat realistic in other areas so it's more believable here) that 14A has been a positive surprise and they're actually pretty excited about it.

This was supposed to be the node where Intel focused more on low voltage for data center and AI.    > where you rarely push past the best perf/W due to thermal and battery constraints   That is not the case. ST turbo in -H series laptops has always been high, nearly on par with the desktop chips. At the power budgets being discussed, there's plenty available to hit whatever the silicon is capable of, and Intel's never been shy about pushing the limits of thermals.    And again, when you adjust for the power/thermal envelope, you *still* see a clock speed regression vs even ARL-H. The best possible outcome for Intel is actually that they can't hit the same peak voltage but look ok at low to mid.    > Wait for the desktop/server chips before you call it   Server is typically low voltage, or mid voltage at most. It's lower down than even laptop chips. And what desktop?

Intel,"Yeah after being reminded that the LPE cores are also Darkmont like the E-Cores I looked up the layout in detail and the differences is simply the P and E cores are on a large Cluster with L3 Cache and a fast ring-bus, but the LPE cores are seperated from that Ring-bus and don't have any L3 Cache (just access to a ""memory side-cache"" accessible by the NPU and small cluster but not the large cluster).     They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them. The small cluster could be used to offload background tasks to themselves (if the powerlimits aren't hit), which could at least improve 1% lows and fps stability.",Neutral

Those gens still will get driver updates but AMD gave up on trying to implement FSR4 on them, like the leaked scripts earlier this year had performance reduction from 20% to up to 30% FPS to use FSR4 for 6000 series cards since they don't have the hardware and just using brute force software for FSR4.

No what he said is that the Arc B Series hasn't been around for all that long and the B580 has garnered a very positive reception so they felt in terms of branding and marketing moving in Panther Lakes Xe³ into the B series brand is a better marketing move than throwing away the B series branding and starting the C series branding now. In others words they want Panther Lake to ride on the momentum and positive vibes the B series branding has garnered.   Xe³ is a Xe³ based architecture like Xe³P is architecturally but there is more to selling a product than the engineering, keep in mind there's strong rumors that there will be a B770 launch, Intel also just released the B60 and later this year will provide a big software expansion to Bxx cards so the B series brand is still full of life. Xe³P will launch much later and at that point Intel feels there will have passed enough time to leave the B series branding behind.",Neutral

Intel,"No public announcements yet, but logically it would make all the sense for Intel to launch them, and do so in larger quantities so people in the market can get them at MSRP. Battlemage proved there is a lot more demand than there was supply, and it'd take too long to ramp it up once it became clear they were received well. With proof of a market test pass, they've now got a chance to do it right.

Intel,"They would be extremely stupid not to continue to release discrete graphics cards, even if they decide to release 2-3 gaming SKUs per new generation; entry/budget, mid-range, high-end, etc.  - they win. until they keep iterating up, maturing driver, increasing install user base, improving software, until the point they can target higher segments (enthusiast tier)  Gaming GPUs remain the flagship component that pushes the limits of silicon design, features like ray tracing, AI upscaling, and real time path racing all debut in gaming before trickling into pro and AI workloads. Every research report shows that demand for high-end GPUs is still strong. Steam HW survey shows the most popular GPUs are still mid-range gaming cards, showing that discrete GPUs remain central to the PC ecosystem.  And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",Neutral

Now I'm not saying it's a bad thing, Intel has a lot of inefficiencies with Battlemage, a lot of time you expect it perform better judging by the amount of hardware.

As I read it and looking the architecture it's battlemage with some enhancement that will come to future product celestial. Something like RDNA 3.5. I think they messed up the naming - they want to present it as something new and different (it's in some aspects) but it's not the real next gen in their roadmap.",Neutral
Intel,By discrete iam assuming you mean client graphics SoCs? The margins are not enough on those - you make much more money on Pro cards/ HPC.,Neutral
Intel,"No this is not the case. The decision is purely branding. Xe3 and Xe3P are part of the same generation architecture wise unlike Xe2 and Battlemage, he addressed this.",Neutral

Intel,"The implication here is incredibly obvious:  ""Intel Arc B-Series consistes of Battlemage discrete graphics *and* PTL iGPUs"".  That's the implication here. It explicitly calls BMG dGPU cards ""discrete"" and does not do so for PTL",Neutral
Intel,Because it's most likely still the same foundation. Xe3 just have additional optimizations and HW blocks along the lines of OMM (confirmed) and whatever new tech Intel decides is worth pushing for higher end parts.

Intel,"> It explicitly calls BMG dGPU cards ""discrete"" and does not do so for PTL  Of course not, since it would instantly tank their reputation and will kill all further ARC-sales?!  Do you actually think, that Intel is that stupid to plain announce the death of ARC-series graphics-cards? Do you think they'd even sell a hundreds cards after such a announcement? Who would by a dead-end line of graphics-cards, which won't even get any further driver-support and still have disastrous drivers like Intel's ARC? NO-ONE!  Of course they virtue signal it through the backdoor here, to preserve the sell-off the of the rest of pile of shame of their B-series graphics-cards as long as possible (leaving users with none support afterwards), and *only then* pull the plug afterwards when they went through their inventory …  Since when are you following Intel? Intel has always done so, and only announced a sudden discontinuation once the inventory was sold (leaving customers in the open with no further support overnight), despite virtue signalling a continuation all the time (to preserve a proper sell-off).  ---- Wasn't this exactly the same story with **Optane** back then? Each and every question upon a future support was answered in the affirmative, only to pull the plug overnight again as usual …  I'm not another piracy of cons here, it's Intel pulling the same Optane-stunt with ARC – Happily selling off their cards, knowing darn well, that they will pull the plug, yet refuse to actually play with open cards again.",Negative

Intel,Lol if you believe that I have a bridge to sell you in Brooklyn,Neutral
Intel,"You have to look at this from both sides.  This would give NVidia the ability to offer OEMs a tightly integrated on SOC gfx solution vs a separate discrete gfx package as it is now. This would lower costs for NVidia's customers as well as improve performance and Intel's cpu's get to ride that train.   Intel has a long track record of using integrated gfx so it's certainly right up their alley to take this on.  Could Xe gfx coexist with NVidia? Yep, I think so.  Xe could be the budget igfx option and iNVidia is the premium integrated solution. That's basically how it is now with Intel Arc/Battlemage & GTX.   On the DC side, Intel has absolutely no gfx solution at this time and won't have anything for at least two years.  Intel already sells NVidia when a gfx solutions are needed so tighter integrated products will benefit both sides in that DC space as well.",Positive
Intel,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work. And even if NVIDIA wants to keep Intel's fabs open, I doubt they want to run them either.",Neutral

If you are referring to AIB Partners, then that can hardly be called an actual partnership. That's more of a contracted labor and distribution agreement.

Intel,"That really is up for debate. That they are losing money on them when you account for RNE and RnD amortized by unit, sure. That I have no doubt about.

Intel,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction. Very important when running 24-48 hour simulations.",Neutral

I believe VDI is Microsoft's implementation. I believe I've done VDI on my RTX 2070 before (I have done seamless sharing between host and VM), but I don't know if it's possible with AMD. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm more familiar with the Linux side / vGPU than VDI.  ECC is Error Correcting RAM. I generally don't understand the use case for ECC either, but it is ubiquitous in HPC. All server boards support ECC RAM.  In modern environments most of these features need 16GB of VRAM minimum, but if you ever wanted to try it on a consumer card, you could get an old RTX 20 series and try it out with some driver mods. Optionally, the P40 is still pretty cheap ($250 used) and doesn't need those hacks at the cost of drawing a lot of power, which Intel has solved with their Battlemage Pro platform (by far the cheapest VRAM/$/W you can get).",Neutral

Calculations, it absolutely depends on what you're calculating and which bit gets flipped; flipping the low-order bit in a number might not matter much and flipping the high-order bit could cause a big error.  Networking, it depends on whether the protocols you use have more error checks at a higher level (TCP does; UDP does not).

The whole purpose behind Falcon Shores (and now Jaguar Shores, if it will even happen) is to put Gaudi performance (i.e. tensor cores) in an Xe-HPC package.

Intel,"LMAO, I actually have quite a bit of knowledge in this area.  If all you care for is VDI for a small number of VMs, then you'd go GPU passthrough. vGPU / MxGPU often requires higher levels of hypervisor software tier (i.e. VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus), requiring more money. For KVM hosts, setting up vGPU is a lot more difficult and time consuming than just straight up GPU passthrough.  Only two groups of people would be interested in GPU virtualization / splitting:  * Enterprise, in which they wouldn't care about the used card prices.  * Enthusiasts, in which they wouldn't want to pay for vGPU prices anyway. So why bother catering to this crowd?",Neutral
Intel,"Full GPU passthrough is not a solution that many people would consider because it is clumsier than using sr-iov (or potentially VirtIO GPU Venus). Plus for each extra passthrough instance I would have to add in another GPU and this greatly increases power consumption, heat output and cooling requirements. The process is not all that much more complicated at least on Turing GPUs with a hacked driver on KVM guests at least. Plus for passthrough, you probably still need an NVIDIA card because last I checked AMD cards still had a random kernel panic issue after being passed through.  My assumption is that sr-iov on the b50 will allow users an affordable way to have multiple guests on one host GPU without increasing power draw and paying for expensive alternatives and expensive vGPU subscriptions.",Negative
Intel,"...first time I heard people prefer SRIOV over GPU passthrough because it's ""clumsier"" lol. I'm sure setting up mdev devices in KVM, finding the correct corresponding GPU instances, making them persistent through reboot, then edit virsh xml for each individual VM is a lot easier than just doing IOMMU passthrough. /s     Again, enthusiasts don't care about power consumption / heat output / cooling requirements for their lab environment.

Intel,"> It's hard to think of this fitting a niche of someone with a pretty powerful CPU who wants a midrange GPU.  Is it really though? Powerful CPUs are comparatively cheap, powerful GPUs are expensive. I know plenty of people who went with a 9700X/7700X or even 9800X3D but 'cheaped out' on the GPU because spending $1200 on a 4080 (at the time) was simply too much.",Neutral
Intel,"I agree with everything you said.  However, I myself will buy one just because I want more competition and so I am just going to give Intel a sale. Sure it doesn't move the needle much, sure Intel's probably not going to make any money out of it and I personally probably won't use it much, but I am just doing it out of principle. I sure am in the minority, but at this point I can't sit idle and allow this duopoly to continue without trying something.",Neutral
Intel,"It's a hardware problem, not a driver problem. The cards have insufficient DMA capabilities and uploads must be handled by the CPU, no driver will fix it, and as a consequence the B770 will have even worse overhead.",Negative

The shipping manifests that have been floating around for the better part of a year have been for the BMG G31. Unless new leaks I'm not up to date with are discussing a G31 with a different prefix, everything points towards it being battlemage, not celestial.  Now I pray that Intel have found a way to mitigate the driver overhead. If not, the B770 will be utterly useless for gaming. Nvidia is bad in the overhead regard, but the B580 is damn near an order of magnitude worse.",Neutral

Intel,"HUB showed the b580 lost like 20%+ perf between the 9800x3d and the 7600 or 5700x3d and actually fell behind the 4060, as the 4060 lost minimal performance on the weaker cpu vs using the 9800x3d. And the 7600x and 5700x3d can certainly power much stronger gpus like the rtx 5070 without bottleneck.

Intel,"You will be best off navigating the used market. $100 is a pretty tough number to work with that would likely limit you to sidegrades or very small increases - closer to $200 will be able to get you a really nice upgrade, and there are a few decent choices in-between.  I'd be looking at a 3060 Ti personally - they're a really good used option that can be found around the $175-200 range right now. If you can find a good deal, the 6600XT is another solid choice to consider, though it'd be a smaller uplift and they're not much cheaper than the 3060 Ti from what I've been seeing.",Positive

Intel,The 5060 ti is 40 percent faster than the 9060 xt in arc raiders(very heavily nvidia favoured title). E33 doesn't have fsr 4 native only dlss 4 so yeah I think the 5060 ti is the easy choice here.  In most games they are pretty equal though with about a 4-6 percent average lead for the 5060 ti,Neutral
Intel,"I have a 5070ti (Gigabyte) and a 7900XTX (Sapphire Pulse). IMHO, the 5070 has a better pack of features than the 7900. The performance is similar, with a tiny variation in specific games. NVIDIA app has a ton of customization and QoL features that tip the scale for me.   Now, regarding GPUxCPU... Always split more of your budget towards a video card than you do towards CPU. As you climb resolution or graphic configurations, the performance is heavily tethered down to what your GPU can handle.   There's a great chart by Tom's Hardware in the [following link](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/cpu-vs-gpu-upgrade-benchmarks-testing) that'll be a good representation of what I'm saying.

Intel,"5800x should be perfect for a 3080 and GPU usage should be high in most situations.  really maybe only 5% of games could truly max out a modern 8 core 16 thread cpu like a 5800x at 1080p, so to constantly be hitting 100% load to a point of noticeable stutter and low GPU usage doesn’t seem normal.

Intel,"What's the temp, and what motherboard do you have? If temps are fine, it might be a VRM issue. You can run Cinebench with hwinfo64 and look for something that's off. High VRM temp or CPU throttle usually means a VRM issue if the CPU temp is fine.",Neutral
Intel,"5800x will  get very hot,  way hotter than your 2600x, it needs a beefy cooling solution so you don't thermal throttle it. Did you use the same 2600x cooler with the 5800x? what temps and clock speeds are you seeing with the 5800x?",Neutral

Intel,BF6 should play well with that set up. Video benchmarks display well on YT. I found this similar user on reddit who repseated the ram. Maybe try that if you haven't.  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/s/MlqxIgPt9z,Positive
Intel,"It does in BF6. My friend with 5800x and 5070ti has low GPU usage too as the CPU can't push enough. On the other hand with 5800x3d and 5070ti I'm on a high GPU usage and got 40+ fps more. We are both using ultrawide monitors.   That game is really heavily bottlenecked by the CPU, and it looks like the 3D cache brings massive improvements there.",Neutral

I can’t really check anything now as I noticed it was only reading half my RAM (8Gb should be 16Gb) and now I’ve tried reseating the RAM it won’t boot to bios, just giving me a yellow/orange led.

The last time it finally worked, but only 1 RAM stick and then finally both read. No idea what the real issue was, but likely RAM issue. In my experience it’s always the bloody RAM.",Negative
Intel,"Yeah I’m running my game in 3840x1080, but even windowed at 1920x1080 doesn’t make any difference. BF6 was completely unplayable on the 2600x all the audio started going choppy, and the fps was really stuttering.",Negative
Intel,"Are you saying their 5800x is hitting 100% load at what im assuming is 3440x1440?   5800x in general is too slow for a 5070ti. It’s going to have low GPU usage in basically all scenarios even without maxing out.

Intel,"His CPU stays at 60%-70% circa in BF6. Generally, he is GPU limited in almost all games - this was the first case in which the GPU had such a lower usage.  Yeah, I upgraded earlier than him when the 5800x3d were still produced/in stock. When he started thinking about upgrades even the 5700x3d was no longer available. However, the 5800x was dirty cheap, so it wasn't a bad deal.",Neutral

Intel,What is the total allotted budget? And location?,Neutral
Intel,The thermalright royal pretor is as expensive on aliexpress (here in Belgium last i checked) but waaay better at cooling.  I'm using it myself on a 7800x3d and my idle is 30°c and gaming it goes 55°c. I haven't done a stress test yet though.

Intel,"Well, the PSU is ok, right? Like, it works according to reviews",Positive
Intel,"I think I was clear when I said ""IF"" you want to upgrade.  Upgrade isn't only from B580 to something like 5060 Ti. It could be a 5070Ti or 5080 too.",Neutral
Intel,It's quite a bit more but also a board with excellent power delivery and the feature set and io is improved. It's the b650 eagle ax for 50 more euros.,Positive
Intel,I cant. Due to no option for Lithuania in pcpricetracker.,Neutral
Intel,"Thinking about it. It really depends on you.  Are you upgrading next year, go for the 850w one. Also if it is not a big upgrade. You want some headroom and also keep that battery at it's sweet 50% mark.  If you are upgrading waay later like 2-3 years. Just get this one and save up for a good psu  Edit: your psu has most important safety features but is nothing to write home about. With a warranty of 5 years. So you should be fine.  It has everything you need but constraints you in wattage and only one 4x4 connector. (if you plan on upgrading your motherboard for a better cpu)",Neutral

Intel,"If GPU isn't close to 100% you are CPU limited. The only sizable upgrade would be a ryzen x3d CPU (the i9s aren't much faster than the 13700k), which means new motherboard and ram.   I would honestly stick with what you have. If you want to improve performance a bit you could try overclocking the CPU and ram.",Neutral
Intel,"How does 80% usage point to your GPU needing to be upgraded? The only worthwhile jump for you would be either an X3D chip CPU which is not cheap as you'd have to swap mobo and ram, or going to like a 5070 TI which is only I think like a 30% performance jump for like $750 at best?",Neutral
Intel,"Looks pretty good as is, you are cpu limited though. Running at 1080p? Only thing I would suggest (which is free) is ensuring XMP is enabled and your ram is running st full speed. Other than that, you could try disabling e-cores and/or overclock the P-cores.  Also would you really benefit from more than 160-200fps?",Positive
Intel,"Leave it as is  Tweak your RAM for a bit more negligible performance gains  If you want more out of your current GPU, you'd want to get on the AM5 platform   If you want to ""bottleneck"" more so with a faster GPU, you'll have to upgrade your power supply as well",Neutral
Intel,"I have a 9800X3D and get the same numbers in BF6. I run it at 1080p low.   There's really no point in upgrading. BF6, Arc raiders, Warzone are all CPU-bound games. But they all run very well.   In order for you to get higher than the 160-200fps that you're currently getting in those games, you'll need to either use DLSS and/or Frame Gen (it looks really ugly and fuzzy using DLSS at 1080p); or spend over $1200 upgrading CPU and GPU for what would amount to barely a 40fps increase - if any. DDR5 prices are through the roof and with me being on DDR5, I'm telling you that moving to DDR5 alone is NOT going to give you a performance improvement because your limitation is not memory bandwidth as I already stated I get similar numbers.   Just keep what you have. You got a great rig. No reason to needlessly upgrade your rig when the improvement isn't going to give you what you're looking for. And thats even after selling your old parts.  Overclocking might give you a very tiny bump in performance - but in order to have a stable and reliable overclock, on GPU, CPU & RAM... its incredibly tedious work that takes weeks of testing every single change - for what amounts to usually less than a 10% gain.

Intel,Get a cheap AMD second GPU and run lossless scaling 👍 you might need a bigger PSU but overall this is a cheap upgrade path for 2x dos since you'd have to upgrade to a beefier GPU or new mobo+CPU to get gains here.,Neutral
Intel,"Your CPU is fine – a 13700KF isn’t holding you back in Warzone/BF. The weak link right now is the RAM. You’ve got 32GB of DDR4-3200, which is pretty slow for that chip. Swapping to a 32GB kit of DDR4-3600 CL16 is cheap and will help 1% lows and overall smoothness.  On the GPU side: even though you “only” see ~80% usage, it can still be the limiter. GPU usage is an average – it can spike to 99% in microbursts, and as long as GPU frame time is higher than CPU frame time, the GPU is what’s capping FPS. In practice, if the GPU is consistently loaded more than the CPU in a game, you’re effectively GPU-bound.  If you want more FPS right now, a 4070 Ti Super or 4080 Super is the logical upgrade. If you’re not in a rush, you could skip a mid-cycle upgrade and wait for a 50-series card (5070/5080/5090) once prices settle – that’ll be a bigger jump per dollar than going from a 4070 to another 40-series card today.  Also, the HYTE Y40 looks great but can be a bit tight on GPU airflow. Adding a couple of bottom intake fans blowing at the GPU is a cheap tweak that helps temps and lets the card hold higher boost clocks.  TL;DR: – Keep the 13700KF – Upgrade RAM to 32GB DDR4-3600 CL16 – You’re still effectively GPU-limited even at ~80% usage – Options: 4070 Ti Super / 4080 Super now or wait and jump to a 50-series (5070/5080/5090) – Add bottom intake fans for better GPU airflow",Neutral
Intel,He's not CPU limited at 40% usage.,Neutral
Intel,"Game's don't use many cores, so CPU usage stays low even when you are cpu limited",Neutral
Intel,"40% utilization on OP's 13700KF can mean there are 4-6 cores that are at 100% utilization.   Most games barely use 6 cores so a CPU that has 16 cores like OPs CPU, a CPU doesn't have to hit 100% utilization in order to be CPU-limited.   Many games behave this way because they are primarily CPU-bound and there really isn't anything you can do about it.   OP upgrading to a 13900k or 14900 MIGHT help, but the performance improvement is going to be so low that it will never actually justify the cost of upgrading.",Neutral
Intel,Excellent bang for buck with drivers getting better and better.,Positive
Intel,They're good if it's a decent bit cheaper than the 9060 xt.  You also need a fast CPU since the b580 scales with how good/bad your CPU is.,Positive
Intel,"Are you buying brand new or used? If you are considering new, I would suggest going used instead as you can get a better card for the same amount of money as a new B580.",Neutral
Intel,I mean it's alright. It's got 12GB of VRAM which is cool I guess but XeSS is not that great compared to DLSS 4 and FSR 4 these days and the performance is slower than a 5060 or 9060 XT 8GB.,Negative
Intel,"I have a B580 linked up to a 4K TV. The only quirk I've really noticed is that changes in resolution, refresh rate or HDR on/off will occasionally cause the TV to hard reboot. I'm not sure if this would happen with a regular PC monitor, but this never happened with the previous GTX 750 Ti I had.  Otherwise performance in games is as expected from reviews. I don't play AAA games in 4K with it, but haven't had crashing issues that some people report.",Neutral
Intel,"with how bad GPU pricing is slated to be due to the memory shortages, I'm starting to consider a B580 so I can at least have a GPU that should be able to play BeamNG in 3440x1440. not keen on having to replace it within less than three years though, but maybe I'm severely overestimating how much GPU I actually need in a realistic gaming scenario. the used market here has been rather dodgy as of late.",Negative

Intel,"Agree, the only high ticket items i buy used are things i can physically fix myself such as cars and bikes",Neutral
Intel,"You are incredibly misinformed. TV upscalers are nothing like DLSS and FSR.  A TV's upscaler really doesn't work all that well in gaming one because they generally don't really make games running at 1080p look like 4K since that's what most TVs are nowadays and this is coming from someone with a 4K Samsung.  Also DLSS and FSR improve performance, reduce motion blur, give better anti aliasing than regular TAA all of which a TV upscaler doesn't do.   Also TV upscalers introduce extra processing lag from the upscaling which DLSS and FSR straight up lower latency because of the performance uplift.",Negative
Intel,"It's technically slower than even the 9060 XT 8GB which is usually around the same price give or take 20-30 bucks. I wouldn't call it ""seriously impressive for the price"" at all it's only saving grace is having 12GB of VRAM but it's got iffy drivers, cpu overhead and a worse upscaler.  It's not impressive at all. It's decent at best. It's cool that it has 12GB of VRAM and that might matter in a handful of games at 1080p at maxed out settings or matter more in 1440p but it really lacks reasonable performance to play the latest games in 1440p without relying on upscaling which it has been surpassed by in FSR4",Negative
Intel,"oh thank you so much for the info. i'd look into that. i'm using a samsung 65"" 4k tv and i usually output 1440p from the gpu via hdmi to the tv and let the tv do the upscaling thing. i'd try enabling the upscaling in gpu and output 4k to the tv and see if i could spot the difference",Neutral

Intel,It’s bad advice to say the 5080 is worth a 28% increase in price for far less than that in performance,Negative
Intel,"There actually is also the possibility of going 9070 XT when talking value. Cheapest, which is Powercolor's Reaper going for 639€ right now compared to the 5070 TI's 769€ pricetag.",Neutral
Intel,I'm just going off what nVidia recommends and what google outputs.  The 5700x3D is a 105W CPU and the recommendations probably include 170Ws.  I suspect the 750W would work on a lot of games and crash at random times.  It also might just kill the PSU sooner.  I mainly like the 5070s cause as far as I know they don't suffer from any connectors melting.,Negative

Intel,I just upgraded to a 9070 XT from a 2070 Super. Couldn’t be happier. It has amazing performance for the price. I use a 4k tv as a monitor and it is tackling 4k games well and 1440p games perfectly.   I was on the fence between the 9070 XT and the 5070 TI but the cost savings for essentially equal performance helped me decide.,Positive
Intel,Well yeah that’s another 130€ you could save especially if you’re playing BF6 and CS2,Positive
Intel,130€ puts them at equal value once you take nvidias feature set into account in my eyes. Id go 5070ti + 280hz tandem oled,Neutral
Intel,Mainly what I'm interested is will the difference in performance be noticeable between 5070TI and 5080 since I'm probably pretty CPU bound with 5700x3d. I might probably sell my GPU and go all out in 2 years.,Neutral
Intel,Holy fuck buddy bro said he wants a monitor at some point maybe blowing another ~$370 CAD on a graphics card isn’t a good idea,Negative
Intel,"What I tend to do is look for YouTube benchmarks of builds I intend to go with. Like ""5700x3d 5070ti vs 5700x3d 5080"" then go through it until I see the resolution I play at. On some games the 5080 is 30% more typically, then on other games it's not so much.",Neutral
Intel,"What are your struggling scenarios that you want to upgrade almost the whole system? Games are not that hard to operate, except if you want absolute graphics quality.",Neutral
Intel,"Coffee Lake is old at this point, and there isn't really a good upgrade path. Even the top dog of that era the 9900k is quite slow by modern standards, and will be a bottleneck for most mid to high end GPUs. I guess you can choose to upgrade just the GPU alone and stick with the 9600k. Just know that in CPU limited games, you most likely will see a substantial CPU bottleneck.",Negative
Intel,"The main thing I am coming across is titles like Monster Hunter: Wilds, Borderlands 4 etc that are both poorly optimised and CPU intensive. In theory my current specs are right on the ""minimum"" specs to play MH:Wilds, but in practice I get barely a stable 30fps at 1080p, even using upscaling and low settings.    I have contemplated just a GPU upgrade (e.g. picking up a 30series GTX), anything newer and I assume I'll end up severely CPU limited. But then I still have a 6 generation old CPU and a few generation old GPU, so probably land in the same situation with the next generation of games. And a 3060 new still costs almost as much as a B580 or RTX5060, so doesn't seem cost effective.",Negative
Intel,That's why I'm contemplating a full CPU/mobo/GPU upgrade and keeping the ram/SSD/PSU.    Its just not clear to me what a good GPU match for a 13-14 gen i5 (or equivalent AMD) would be so I can keep my RAM. Or even whether it's a good idea at this point to hold on to my RAM (e.g. should I just wait until I can afford a newer system and go full DDR5?,Neutral
Intel,"There are 2 things we can probaly do:  1. Tweaking this old system to squeeze the most out of it for best performance at stable state while gaming. You won't get significant improvements but in other hand, it is free. Your risk is the temperature and voltage. 2. Generational upgrade that cost us minimal changes with most reusable parts.",Neutral
Intel,"Well, there's also the problem that your RAM 2666 is pretty slow for DDR4. Also, whether it's AM4 Zen3 or 12/13/14th gen, you're basically investing in a OLD platforms that's not only slower than modern AM5, but also has no future.   Honestly, i'd stick with Coffee lake at this point, maybe see if i can swap to a 8700k for cheap, and go with a low end GPU like a 5060 or B580 and deal with the CPU issues until prices normalize.",Negative
Intel,"Thanks, that makes sense. I kind of suspected that while my RAM and SSD were compatible with newer systems, but not actually very good anymore (given they weren't exactly cutting edge 7 years ago when I got them) - but it's good to confirm that.   I think I'll look around for cheap/second hand GPU options and otherwise wait around until I can afford a complete system update.",Positive
Intel,"No problem. Your SSD is decent, if a bit smaller capacity. I had this exact same model and it's in my dad's pc right now. 500GB is still ok for a system storage drive if u don't have a ton of stuff. Gen 3 speeds are still more than enough for daily use imo. You'll still need a extra SSD for games if you don't have that.   As for the ram, you could see if u can overclock it to 3000 mhz. If you don't mind used, then it's ok to migrate them to a AM4 b450/550 platform and maybe pair it with a Ryzen 5 5600x . You can probably get the pair for around $150-200 used and elevate some CPU performance issues you'll have. Granted, what I said about investing in old platforms with no future still stands, but if the price is right and you really need the increased CPU performance, then it could be justifiable.",Positive
Intel,"Arc B580 is a good budget card and leagues better then a 3050, just note it will probably struggle on high settings on 1440p. On tomshardware it scored 42.6 FPS on average for 1440p Ultra Rast which included God of War Ragnarök in there game selection.   If you want to play high settings consistently without frame gen at 1440p, I would spend the extra $100 for the 9060XT 16GB. It scored 40% higher then the B580, and cost 40% more. So you're getting same value wise, for price to performance 1440p Ultra.  Also note, Intel GPU's are still new and have the most vary performance with time,  so I would actually imagine the B580 is a bit better then the recorded benchmark I'm refrencing from.

Intel,"Depends on pricing, the B580 is a decent deal in the UK, you can get it here for £200 and a choice of a £60 game out of four options including BF6 so a no brainer for budget builders. Anymore than £200 or the dollar equivalent id just jump to a 5060 or better yet 9060XT 16gb. There will be some CPU bottleneck, but you can get alot of performance out of itself still.",Positive

Intel,"At 4K you’ll likely need to use FSR for some games to be playable/smooth, which is no problem since FSR 4 is pretty good.   I use FSR 3 for 4K with my 7900 XTX when I need it, but most games run on >100 FPS anyway and games like Overwatch even at 200+ FPS. If you really want Raytracing/Pathtracing you have to choose between FSR or low FPS",Positive
Intel,"Depends on your tolerance for 60 fps. If 60 fps is enough then go 4k. A lot of us don't play below 100 gps because it just doesn't look good comparatively, and you can't consistently get over 100 fps at 4k on a 9070xt. I have a 4090 and stay at 1440p.

To me the jump from 1440p to 4K on a monitor isn't worth it, but it's 100% worth it on a quality TV.  Also, I wouldn't be worried about having to use FSR.

In 1440p you'll be able to play almost any game no problem, unless it's an extremely poorly optimized game.  Realistically if you're looking to game in 4k and want an AMD GPU, get the RX 7900 XTX, as it has 24gb VRAM in comparins to the 9070xt's 16gb VRAM, which most likely won't be enough for a decent amount of games in 4K.

Even newer Unreal 5 games like Stalker 2 doesn't use more than ~11GB of VRAM completely maxed out (without ray tracing).  The 9070 XT will also need upscaling in a variety of games, which reduces VRAM usage by a measurable amount.  The only reason to choose a 7900 XTX over the 9070 XT is if you can find it much cheaper, or you're planning on playing heavily modded games with huge textures.",Negative
Intel,1440p ≠ 2K,Neutral
Intel,"But for 4k the 7900 XTX is the better choice, specifically because of the extra VRAM. 9070 XT is more future proof, 7900 XTX is a better 4k card. 9070 XT i think has slightly better raw performance.  Future Proof = 9070 XT   Strictly 4k Gaming = RX 7900 XTX   Alternative = wait for RDNA 5 because the price for both 9070 xt and 7900 xtx will probably drop over time",Positive

You're literally specifying here without RayTracing, obviously without RayTracing 16gb is going to be enough. If you have to specify specific settings you cannot use to try and disprove me, then you're argument is trash. Also, the 9070 XT is CAPABLE of RayTracing, and if someones card is capable, their most likely going to want to play using those settings. But there is a VRAM overload, so people have to compromise. Because the 7900 XTX has 8gb more VRAM, you don't HAVE to compromise and you can max out RayTracing without having to worry about VRAM. You're literally cherry picking settings to try to disprove my point.   Also, what if i wanted to mod using my RX 9070 XT but can't because using 4K resolution with max graphics has used up all my VRAM and i have no more headroom? You said the only reason to choose a 7900 XTX is if you're planning on heavily modding games yet you clearly didn't take into consideration someone may want to mod with an RX 9070 XT as well. The RX 9070 XT is widely considered a premium 2k card, not 4k. And it's not considered 4k because playing with 4k max settings with RayTracing usually exceeds 16gb VRAM, and people LIKE RayTracing. So strictly for 4K, people will opt for the 7900 XTX.  RX 9070 XT however is newer, has FSR 4, more updated drivers. But the RX 7900 XTX has way more VRAM headroom, especially for people who want to use RayTracing in 4K, which the RX 9070 XT won't be capable of in a fair number of titles unless you manually choose the settings yourself, and even then you're leaving yourself no headroom for modding. RX 9070 XT is more future-proof in terms of performance, but RX 7900 XTX is more future-proof strictly for gaming in 4K, as games are only going to get more VRAM demanding.  7900 XTX is only better under specific uses, and this specific use being 4K. And that's SPECIFICALLY because of the extra 8gb VRAM.",Neutral

Intel,"The 7900 XTX can't max out ray tracing at 4K, so that's a completely moot point. The amount of ray tracing that card can do at acceptable framerates will never make it go above 16GB VRAM.  And yes, I specifically said to get the 7900 XTX if you want to play games with huge texture mods, but you can still play modded games with a 16GB card just fine. I played a heavily modded Skyrim with almost only 4K textures, and it hovered at ~12.5GB  Sure, people like ray tracing, but that doesn't change the fact that neither of those cards can max out ray tracing - and keep acceptable framerates - to the point where it becomes an issue with regards to their VRAM buffer.  The only way you're doing max settings and path tracing is with performance mode upscaling, at which point you're just not maxing out that 16GB VRAM buffer.

Intel,"EDIT: SOLUTION: problem was gpu in bottom slot not top -> switching to top slot solved it!  okay i also have a 9800x3d + 5080 but with 64gb ram but that shouldnt matter and i easily get 200fps in most games on ultra in 1440p  okay a few ideas: 1. can u check if your cpu is boosting or just stuck to the base clock if not check bios 2. the current bios version of msi x870 is known for poor audio, earlier versions are better but i do not know which 3. try slower ram. set it to expo 1 not expo 2 and run it at 5600MT i had a similar problem but on an older system 4. install amd chipset driver since windows updates do not install them 5. are ur pcie lanes limited? is ur gpu slot set to pcie5x4 and not 5x16?  yea these are my ideas hope it helps :/  do the chipset driver update first",Neutral
Intel,GPU on top or bottom pcie slot?  All GPU cables plugged in and firmly?  Did you by chance flip the bios 2 mode on the GPU?  Download afterburner and set all settings to default. Then max out the power slider.,Neutral
Intel,I had the same problem when I upgraded my CPU. Turns out my CPU cooler wasn’t properly screwed down and was unevenly placed causing my CPU to have heat spikes and I was having major stuttering and lag. I was so confused because it was a far better and more expensive CPU. If you have an AIO make sure you removed the sticker or that the pump is working correctly,Negative
Intel,"Turn off expo and try again, if it's stutter free then your ram at expo isn't stable on your particular system",Neutral
Intel,Quick question. Is doing anything in windows also quite laggy or jittery?,Neutral
Intel,"Out of curiosity, is ReBAR enabled",Neutral
Intel,"Are you using a riser cable by any chance?  I would also do a DDU pass with no internet plugged in and install the GPU and Audio river manually, maybe Windows update got in the way there - unusual these days but hardly unheard of.  Shoudl also probably install HWINfo64 and check temps and clocks across the board. Maybe you have a single core that is heating up and that doesn't show in averages.",Neutral
Intel,Some other instances of very poor performance or stuttering were resolved by changing the PCIe setting in the BIOS from Auto to something else.,Negative
Intel,From your responds to messages here it sounds like your motherboard is DoA. Or wild guess you missed a standoff or motherboard isn’t aligned correctly on case and that could be causing the audio interference and shorting the motherboard would cause all the other issues,Negative
Intel,I've seen multiple AMD builds act weird until the latest AMD Chipset Drivers are manually installed: [https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RYZEN-CHIPSET-7-06-02-123.html](https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RYZEN-CHIPSET-7-06-02-123.html),Neutral
Intel,Change monitor refresh rate to the highest it will go.  Disable v-sync in games.  Reboot and load into BIOS. What is your IDLE temp?,Neutral
Intel,Are you plugged into the GPU or the Mobo? This might sound dumb but your PC might be defaulting to your integrated graphics.,Neutral
Intel,Do you have a spare drive to test with? Any 3rd party AV? What monitor is being used? Tried GPU in another system?,Neutral
Intel,Do you have your old PC to test the new GPU in? Provided you have a decent enough PSU to use a 5080 that is.   Before that try reseating the GPU. Pull it out of its socket and reinstall it. I know it's silly but it's actually been a culprit for me years ago after like 5 years of no issues. It's also an easy thing to check.,Neutral
Intel,Any RGB software running? if so good to disable it for now. I generally check task manager for anything taking over a few percent cpu. My case management software cost me 5% performance drop too,Negative
Intel,"Are you using dport or hdmi?  If you have upgraded to a 4k monitor, this can have a huge impact on your fps.",Neutral
Intel,"I have this weird issue with my build. Performance tanks and I hear crackling and static sound for noise. It's a ryzen 7600 with a 7700xt. Here is how I HAVE to start my PC in order for it to work properly. I've tried many many many ways, reinstalls, bios settings, and even going to Linux! This might help you. First, If my PC is off, I have to move my display cable to the integrated slot, then I turn on the PC and let it boot to desktop. After that, I open task manager and watch the graph for my discrete GPU. Obviously the igpu will have all of the fluctuations, but my discrete will stay flat for close to a minute. Then I open steam or YouTube and wait until I see repetitive motions on the graph for the discrete. In my case, I get tiny little mountains back to back. That means I can move the display cable to my discrete and everything works fine.  Any variation on this and it won't work. Give it a shot. Basically hot starting your GPU",Negative
Intel,"Are you on the latest nvidia driver, Dec 04? It fixes very low performance on 50 series gpus from Win11 KB5066835 update.

Intel,Manual requires close examination and thought about how PCI works.,Neutral
Intel,wow never knew this,Neutral
Intel,"Haha oh man I did the same thing when I built it my PC a few weeks back, I was so relieved when I realized it was me being stupid. Though I had been sent a bricked GPU or something 🤦🏾",Negative
Intel,You plugged monitor into motherboard hdmi instead of video card hdmi,Neutral
Intel,"Reinstall drivers, check again that you didn’t output to integrated graphics make sure your system is registering the 5080 and 9800x3d if it is then you probably have a bad gpu.",Negative
Intel,"Your parts list seems jumbled a little, what is your PSU?",Neutral
Intel,Or a bad motherboard,Negative
Intel,Could you elaborate on cpu temps and clock speed under stress?,Neutral
Intel,This just sounds like a broken PSU or motherboard. I would buy one from a store where you can definitely return it even if used and when you figure out what part is faulty you send that original back for a new one or return it completely and use the new fine one.,Negative
Intel,"Have u tried going to your wifi and stop ""auto roaming""? This did the fix for me",Negative
Intel,"Happy for you that it was such an easy fix.  My post may butthurt some people but its not meant as a judgement or criticism of anyone. its good that people rush to help others this is what reddit was meant to be like. and in fact its awesome that those who aren't the most knowledgeable or capable also jump in as well, that's how we learn by putting our mistakes in public and being corrected.

I will double check this as well.    5. I honestly can't remember. It seemed like the cords would only fit into their respective spots but its worth popping open.   Thank you for the feedback, this does give me something to check.",Neutral
Intel,GPU is on the bottom.   GPU cables to the motherboard or the cables into the GPU?  All the other BIOS settings would be default.   I will try afterburner and see how that helps!,Neutral
Intel,"It did feel weird installing the CPU cooler so I will check that as well when I pop it back open. I appreciate the thought to check that as well, I wouldn't have otherwise",Neutral
Intel,Alt Tabbing between monitors makes it laggy for a moment. What would that mean?,Neutral
Intel,"Hey I have a similar issue and my windows is definitely laggy and jittery. Opening a window or right clicking is visually less smooth but also hard to notice. The mouse movements are also slightly laggy. The biggest offender is I hear a weird synthetic buzzing sound when I do something that involves sound and my FPS in a game stays below 30. Was this similar to yours?? I've been dealing with this for a year, but the work around I have been doing is starting my PC with iGPU plugged in and then moving the plug to my main GPU. This method lets it run perfectly but I have to do it every restart and also can't use sleep for PC unless I move the display cable around",Negative
Intel,Is that the BIOS setting?,Neutral
Intel,I am not using a riser cable.   I completed that as well and updated the post to mention that.   I didn't think to check any single core so thank you. I will give that a shot!,Neutral
Intel,If you can remember what that something else is I can take a look. Another user mentioned the PCIe cables so I would want to check it all if I can.,Neutral
Intel,Any idea how to definitely check to see if it is DoA? I'm trying to exhaust my troubleshooting options as best I can.,Neutral
Intel,I gave this a shot as well. Thanks for the link but I don't think it made the difference.,Negative

Intel,Now that it is all fixed that will be the next step.,Positive
Intel,Double and triple checked that it is connected to the GPU and not the integrated graphics.,Neutral
Intel,That was my first thought too,Neutral
Intel,Is there a preferred way to ensure that the computer is registering the 5080 and 9800x3d?,Neutral
Intel,"I fixed the list a bit more. The PSU is a ""be quiet! Pure Power 13 M 1000 W 80+ Gold""",Neutral

Intel,If you know of a program to test that I can bring the results back.,Neutral
Intel,Cinegraph is running in the background but with that in mind HWinfo shows I am effectively operating at 5230 MHz at a x52 times ratio. I think this is max capacity? Active clock says 5225 MHz is expected. Temp is sitting at 40C.,Neutral
Intel,That seems to be the general consensus. Between the PCIe inputs for the power and motherboard issues I would enjoy exhausting all other options before needing to rip all those parts and cables out.,Negative
Intel,I an using a hardwired connection. Unless you suspect a wifi setting is interfering?,Neutral
Intel,"1. run a stresstest, cinebench or so. open taskmanager, if the clock is above > 5ghz ur good 2. could but i do not know and read it a week ago 5. no, this is a software thing in the bios. the slot should be right but could be software limited to 1/4 of its bandwith.",Neutral

Intel,"I think it might just be XMP vs Expo 1. XMP is for Intel, Expo is AMD.",Neutral
Intel,"That's the issue. GPU must always be at the top, nearest to the CPU. The 2nd slot is slow so it affects your GPU performance.  Power cables to the GPU.  Changing to the top slot should solve your problem. Have fun with it",Negative
Intel,"Bottom port is PCIe 4.0 x 4 and the middle slot is PCIe 3.0 x 1. Top port (closest to cpu) is PCIe 5.0 x 16. That’s the one you want, even if you set or are using a PCIe 3/4 card.",Neutral
Intel,"GPU in top. If you posted a picture, this would have been solved asap",Neutral
Intel,The general rule is that GPU should be placed in the slot closest to the CPU. I believe it's cause the mobo traces are shorter and it gets priority access to the CPU.,Neutral
Intel,Had a similar problem a few years back. My computer started having performance spikes and stuttering playing old games that were locked at 144hz before. Turns out my CPU fan was loose. I have no idea how it happened but I reseated the cooler and it good as new.   I also feel like half of these posts are from something silly like forgetting to peel the plastic cover on the heat sink or something… it’s worth checking.,Negative

Intel,"For me, I had to change the pxie mode for my x16 slot in the bios from auto to 3.0. I upgraded the cpu and gpu on my sff build. The riser cable I had was 3.0 so I believe that was my issue. For me windows in general was really jittery. Quick question. To rule out your Motherboard. Do you have your old GPU?",Neutral
Intel,"That could just be the lag from going from a fullscreen application/game to one that's not. Check the app you're tabbing from is it in fullscreen mode? Or windowed fullscreen? If it is in FS, switch to windowed FS or borderless windowed and see what happens when you alt tab.",Neutral
Intel,For me it was either the bios or the pcie riser I was using for my gpu. I had to change the pciex16 from auto to 3.0 because my cable was a pcie 3.0 riser.,Neutral
Intel,Yes. It's called resiseable bar. Very important for new cpus.,Positive
Intel,"In the BIOS, your PCIe setting will probably be on Auto. Some people find success with 3.0, others 4.0, and some 5.0. Seems like the Auto is the culprit sometimes. I would start with 5.0 and work your way downwards and see if any version solves it.",Neutral

Intel,That would be amazing if it is the case. I will try it immediately.,Positive
Intel,"That's an incomplete and misleading statement. The top slot is typically connected directly to the CPU, while lower slots can be connected via the chipset which can reduce performance slightly.  Lower slots can also be different PCIe gens, or have a lower lane count, both of which may or may not restrict performance depending on the GPU used.",Neutral

Intel,"To clarify, the top-most x16 slot with x16 pins, or x8 pins if you are repurposing server or workstation equipment.  Some motherboards have a top slot that is electrically x1 but x16 in length. This is less common nowadays with a m.2 slot taking the space of this PCIe card connection, but for those in the future you can check your motherboard manual or just look into the slot to see if it has gold pins in the whole slot or just the first 1-4 cm.  Again, less common nowadays but the visual inspection is the quickest way to tell.",Neutral
Intel,If I have to rebuild it and double check every part and piece to get my peace of mind back I will.,Neutral
Intel,It doesn't seem to be temp issues. It is about 60C while under load. That seems normal.,Negative
Intel,I do not have the old GPU anymore. I am slowly testing and working down the list of PCIe modes in the BIOS though. So fingers crossed that works.,Neutral
Intel,I will give it a check. I normally find myself alt tabbing between a game that is in full screen into a web browser or desktop Discord.,Neutral
Intel,"I checked my bios and I don't have those actual options..my options are auto, x8x8, x8x4x4, and x4x4x4x4 which I've never heard of so I'm going to look into it. Yours understandably makes more sense why it didn't work properly",Neutral

Intel,Sweet! Happy for you.,Positive
Intel,Send them your 5080 as a thank you.,Positive
Intel,Agreed,Neutral
Intel,In that case that stutter is normal as the display adjusts from focusing entirely on the game to a non-fullscreen focus.,Neutral
Intel,"Just remember to keep lowering it and if it’s still no good at 3.0, just change it back to Auto.",Neutral
Intel,"Okay, that makes more sense. 60C suggests to me that you installed your cooler correctly (and you have great airflow). Unfortunately I really think this may be a bad motherboard, especially with the popping and audio distortions you’re hearing.   Since it’s self built, some cables may not be fully seated. Here is the link to the digital English manual for your motherboard: https://download.msi.com/archive/mnu_exe/mb/MAGX870TOMAHAWKWIFI_English.pdf . You want to find the diagram showing what cables go where. I would:   1) specifically pay attention to the 24-pin power cable (a big ass, stiff ass cable that goes from PSU directly to MOBO, plug is labeled ATX_PWR on the diagram). Make sure it’s fully seated. If you want to unplug it and replug it, be careful as it will require some force but you want to be slow with it.   2) look at the two 8-pin power connectors for the CPU. It’s on the top left of the MOBO (labeled CPU_PWR1 and CPU_PWR2 in diagram). This ones a lot easier to plug and unplug. Make sure BOTH are plugged in and fully seated.   3) Confirm that the power connector to the graphics card is fully plugged in. Do that same unplug and replug. Examine the power connector for signs of damage (mainly burning/melted plastic).   4) You may have already done this, but fully reseat your RAM.   5) Make sure the audio cable is fully plugged into the MOBO. This is on the bottom left of your MOBO and is labeled “JAUD1” on the schematic.  IIRC it’s a funky looking plug, haven’t seen anything else like it.    Apologies if you have already done these steps. The only thing it can really be at this point is the MOBO or possibly GPU related, because your processor seems to be doing its job.

Intel,"Fair enough. Look back through my comment if/when you do tear it open, I’ve made some edits to be more specific and concise. If it helps, I don’t think you’ll need to remove any parts to get to any of the cables I mentioned.

I've other very interesting thing they could do is go heavy on vram, not because it's needed for games but because it's needed for bigger at home AI models.   Drop a 32gb just for fun, or larger and let people run bigger models than can even fit on 4090/5090 cards.  Create a cheap alternative to the pro cards.  Don't even worry about speed.  Just gotta fit model sizes.",Positive

Intel,"Not to ruin your day, but selling your 4070S just to ""support"" them is IMO a stupid decision.  The support you ""provided"" is completely negligible, literally a water droplet in a lake. In exchange, you get a far worse experience in your performance, software, power efficiency and compatibility.  All of that just so that you can feel right in your own PoV lol. Selling it doesnt change the fact that you already gave Nvidia your money.  You will be of bigger help by just keeping your 4070S and instead recommending Intel GPUs to your friends and other people who want to build a new PC (assuming Intel nails the pricing right). Spread the word instead, and dont sabotage yourself.",Negative
Intel,But with TDP performance goes in pair. NVIDIA nailed it and they are low TDP high performance. Thats why they are 90%. But to get some traction you have to compete in performance much more then in TDP. Thats what most games care for - FPS.,Negative
Intel,I doubt you're the only person here who was smart enough to put that together u/flatroundworm.,Negative
Intel,4070 and 5070 are extremely close.,Neutral
Intel,"""4090 Performance!""",Neutral
Intel,"Why not? As others have mentioned, their market share is already successfully increasing. There's no reason to think a new desirable GPU wouldn't continue that trend.",Neutral
Intel,"Exactly.  If they were smart, they just build what others don't and build something no one can currently compete with.  Build big and take the sales.   There are three challenges.  One, it needs to be good enough to be on par with the 5070/5080/9070XT.  It needs to be a viable alternative, not 30% worse but on par, however they need to do it.  Two, they need to build a feature no other manufacturer has.  This is the vram part.  Go big.  Make it do something no one can compete with for a period of time   Three is the bigger challenge, but it might or might not matter to certain people.  This is cost and efficiency.  If the cost can be competitive to the 5070 and 9070 XT, they will get considerable sales, not like 1%, but as many sales as they can build for.  The second part efficiency.  If they can be highly efficient, they could market a budget option for AI use, not necessarily fastest but efficient for the work load.  This too could promote a significant sales volume just because it costs less at scale.   But, if very little is as achievable, you can always have a feature no one else has, and you can still sell quite well.",Neutral
Intel,If it's 32 Xe cores (up from 20 on the B580) that'd likely put it somewhere more like a 6800XT or 5060Ti :(,Neutral
Intel,It prevents someone else giving Nvidia their money while propping up intel - if more people did it like this mad lad it would make a difference,Neutral
Intel,"I bought the card used lol , no way I’d pay over msrp . But your statement stands true .",Neutral
Intel,It’s closer to 4070ti. It’s a 23% improvement over 4070. Putting it a little slower than 4070ti but faster than 4070S.,Positive
Intel,"""4100 Performance!""",Neutral
Intel,"It doesnt change the fact that the 4070S was already sold. Nvidia already got their money from that unit. Selling your 4070S DOESNT RETURN what you already gave to nvidia's pockets lol.  You can think of it as **paying for someone** else to get a 4070S.  That is the thing that people like dude above is missing.  In the end, you just sacrificed your own experience for nothing. Its a ***Lose Win*** situation.  I aint gonna be stupid to sabotage myself just for a temporary feeling of being right and morally superior, a feeling that I did the right thing, because in the end, its inconsequential, and I just fucked myself in the process, and what is waiting for me in the end is just regret lol.  You might as well ***keep*** the 4070S, keep the better perf, software, efficiency etc etc and ***just focus on preaching*** to people to buy Intel GPUs (assuming its good value). ***Thats a win win scenario.***  Also, you dont want to mindlessly give Intel your own money. You want them to earn it. Buy Intel GPUs not because you want a 3rd player, but because you know its a good product and helping out a 3rd player in the GPU market is just a nice bonus.  If Intel half assess the B770's pricing and launch, and you still bought it just ""to support the underdog"", you are just incentivizing Intel to continue half assing their approach",Negative
Intel,"Damn I was thinking mobile, those are like 10-15 percent",Negative
Intel,"Private profile, shilling. Jog on buddy, no one knows what the card will be like.",Neutral
Intel,"You keep repeating the idea that “the 4070S was already sold, so nothing changes,” which tells me you’re stuck in the sunk cost fallacy. Nvidia getting money from the original sale is irrelevant to the next decision. What matters in economics is marginal demand. When someone sells their 4070S and chooses Intel for their next GPU, they remove one potential new Nvidia sale (the buyer of the used card may otherwise have purchased new) and simultaneously create one new Intel sale. Those marginal shifts are exactly how incumbents lose revenue and challengers gain market share. Sunk revenue doesn’t grant Nvidia permanent immunity from switching behavior.  A strong second hand market absolutely hurts Nvidia’s future sales. It lowers the effective cost of GPU ownership, pushes price sensitive buyers into used units instead of new ones, and reduces Nvidia’s pricing power. This is standard industrial organization theory used goods cannibalize new goods. Selling the 4070S does not “give Nvidia money,” it gives someone else a path to avoid paying Nvidia at all. Then replacing that card with Intel means Intel gets fresh revenue while Nvidia gets zero. Combine both actions and the net effect is Nvidia loses one new sale, Intel gains one new sale. That is the literal mechanism by which competition grows.  And pretending that “one person doesn’t matter” ignores how collective marginal actions scale. If even a small percentage of consumers switch from buying new Nvidia cards (~€600 on average) to Intel instead, the foregone revenue becomes massive. For example, 100,000 people doing this is €60 million Nvidia doesn’t get and €60 million Intel gains. That’s not “inconsequential”, that’s enough to change pricing strategy, product roadmaps, and R&D priorities. Markets don’t change because one individual defects they change when many individuals do, and that only happens if people stop rationalizing inaction with the sunk cost excuses you’re using.  Your whole argument hinges on a single transaction worldview, as if each GPU purchase is isolated. But the GPU market is dynamic. Nvidia’s future behavior depends on demand elasticity, competitors’ traction, and consumer switching. Selling your Nvidia card and buying Intel is a strategic choice that weakens incumbent dominance, strengthens pricing competition, and signals that alternatives are viable. Yes, you shouldn’t blindly buy Intel if the product is bad but when Intel is competitive, shifting demand is exactly how you incentivize innovation and better pricing across the board. In other words you don’t “sacrifice yourself,” you just refuse to keep subsidizing the monopoly.  In short, your logic collapses because you ignore marginal effects, second hand market cannibalization, collective action, and basic microeconomics. The 4070S sale is sunk the choice of what you buy next is what actually shapes the market.",Negative
Intel,"So what does a private profile got to do with it?  Or did you just ignore all my points.     The fact that said the word ""shilling"" is clear indicator you didnt understand what I said.  Did you want to go full Ad Hominem Fallacy by using my own profile against me while not doing anything with my statements LOL?",Negative
Intel,"Give it time and that guy will switch it up and come back with ""consumers don't matter anymore to Nvidia, only data center"". These corporate bootlickers are very narrow minded.",Negative
Intel,"The fundamental point you have is that a hypothetical card will be worse than the 4070 super, which is silly to say because we just don't know.",Negative
Intel,"Which still doesnt change the fact that itll be less efficienct and have weaker software. The 4070S draws 220W, and has access to a multitude of features at far greater availability and support, that is Nvidia's biggest strength that even AMD stans wont deny.  It still doesnt change the fact that you already gave money to Nvidia.  You could use your own statement against OP and yourself. Why would you sell your GPU when we dont even know how good it is? Lol. You are dumping a good card for an unknown one.  And I already said the following:  >You might as well ***keep*** the 4070S, keep the better perf, software, efficiency etc etc and ***just focus on preaching*** to people to buy Intel GPUs (assuming its good value). ***Thats a win win scenario.***  >You will be of bigger help by just keeping your 4070S and instead recommending Intel GPUs to your friends and other people who want to build a new PC (assuming Intel nails the pricing right). Spread the word instead, and dont sabotage yourself.  Tell me, wheres the shilling here?",Neutral
Intel,It might run Crisis with the Arc card but not very well with the GeForce.  Crisis has been a very bad experience for the last (I think) half a year on Nvidia cards because Nvidia driver has broken some DX9 compatibility,Negative
Intel,The crysis part was more of a meme XD,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah I know, I just find it funny that a 5070 (and any GPU currently supports by Nvidia) can't run a 18 year old game.",Negative
Intel,"The CPU, RAM, and GPU alone would put you at around $1500(if you’re lucky) if bought separate with the current ram prices.",Neutral
Intel,"I just bought exactly those components, a 5070TI, 9800X3D, RM850X, 2TB NVMe, AIO and a new chassi.  All of this cost me... 2200$, which means that for 500$ less than I spent you get a motherboard and **32GB DDR5 RAM!!!**  That would be a good deal even before the RAM shortage, now its literally just highway robbery.",Negative

Intel,"It's a solid PC - if you already owned some of those components. But I wouldn't buy that new. (Owning the same MOBO, RAM, PSU and roughly chip)  What you want is today's equivalent of that setup, which some have listed below.   The problem with this build is that AM4 is no longer in production, so if that 5800X gets a bit slow, you can't upgrade it alone, you'll have to upgrade the motherboard...which means also replacing the RAM.   So what you want is an AM5 setup where you CAN select cheaper components that you can then upgrade later if need be.  Good luck and welcome!",Neutral
Intel,"maybe consider AM5 rather locking yourself in am4, although you will have to pay for those hellish ddr5 ram prices. Plus with am5 you have access to pcie gen 5, and future proofing till 2027 case as said by others is a bit too expensive, you can shave mayb 150-200 for a good looking one and put the money in a better gpu / cpu and for psu, you can get a full atx one with gold or plat rating for less",Neutral
Intel,"https://pcpartpicker.com/list/PffWVF  I dont think I cooked, but Jesus Ram is fucked",Neutral
Intel,That is a lot of money for that PC. If it were me I would definitely drop the $400 case and get a 5070.,Negative
Intel,"Bad value. I got this PC for $1800 in September:  https://www.microcenter.com/product/689586/powerspec-g722-gaming-pc  Even considering RAM prices, it would be still a bad value vs. what you can get in a prebuilt. Micro Center has great prebuilts.",Negative
Intel,"My only suggestion is to not get a 2TB SSD. From my personal experiences having your SSD as purely systematic files allows the OS to boot quicker and update without fail. If you want the SSD to download games faster sure, just make sure you get 2 separate SSD cards. Alternatively most HDD will suffice as a cheap alternative to still have a butt ton of storage. Also 32GB ram is a good starting point, I don’t see anything eating that up immediately, but if you consider recording your game play, discord, 10+ web browsers and other background uses, not to mention the possibility of streaming, I advice getting more RAM (2x32GB is faster than 4x16GB) but that’s only if your plans are professional",Neutral
Intel,I don't know much about AMD cooler quality but they have their own coolers that come with cpu usually. So you can save money there,Neutral
Intel,DDR5 ram may kill his budget.,Neutral
Intel,So I should check better prices for the CPU and GPU?,Neutral
Intel,"oh thank you for that, TBH I didn't realize it was SFX. Are SFX more expensive that regular ATX? I definitely need to check that",Positive
Intel,"Damn man, thank you so much for this. After reading comments, I get that AM4 isn’t a good option so yeah I was think about researching about AM5 to start with it and you dropped a full build so yea I can totally work from this, checking prices.  I’ll check the components in more detail later, but again thank you.",Positive
Intel,"this is an excellent build, you can also probably shave off a good chunk of money by not exclusively looking at 6000 cl30 ram",Positive
Intel,thank you bot,Positive
Intel,"Thank you so much, some others also mentioned about the AM5 and I think it would be the best option but now I need to research about it",Positive
Intel,Thank you!!,Positive
Intel,Would it be better like a 512Gb SSD and 1Tb HDD?  Also not thinking about streaming or something more professional but I will think about 2x32 ram. Thank you!!,Positive
Intel,Probably terrible coolers and loud,Negative
Intel,"And then he absolutely should not be building the system himself. Its just following clear instructions for a few hours for a beginner, that experience should not make you pay $200 more for AM4 + 5060 compared to a 9800X3D + 5070 a system",Negative
Intel,"If that is your budget, I'd generally advice on not getting a $350 case lol. Try to adjust it so you can hop on to AM5, I can't really do the list right now.

Intel,"Costco has rebuilds on sale until the 21st of Dec, pretty sure they are better deals than this. $1500 is 5070 and Ryzen 7 9800X3D",Positive
Intel,"Usually, yes. It generally costs more to make things smaller. Montech has a good deal on an 850w PSU that ranks well in the PSU tier list.",Positive
Intel,He provided a great build for you. I was gonna suggest you get an 9070 XT myself. What screen resolution are you planning to game at?,Positive
Intel,My pleasure  If its out of your budget you could start with a cheaper CPU as the 7800x3d is fantastic but a lot of people might never really use the extra L3 cache and you might be served well enough with a 9600x for example.  We can also take a step back on the GPU and go back to  the 5060TI you chose or a 5070 to also save some money but probably dollar/performance for straight out videogames nothing beats the 9070xt  Then as i mentioned if you are open to other vendors we can probably save some purchasing select pieces from newegg or the mobo/cpu combos from msi  Just let me know if i can help any further,Positive
Intel,"No worries,  The biggest problem right now is that in the last 2 weeks, DDR5 ram has shot up 2-5x in price due to AI datacenter greed and such.  So suddenly a bunch of us are pumping new life into our existing AM4 setups instead of buying new AM5 PCs. Just today I replaced my 5600x CPU with a 2nd hand 5700x3d, which should max out the performance of my AM4 build.  I WAS planning on buying a new AM5 pc with a 7800X3D chip and 6000MHz ram, but the price suddenly jumped by a LOT!  Btw, if you have the budget, try and aim for a 70-series card or AMD equivalent like the 9070. I've always been a 60-series user (960, 3060Ti), but each time I buy it, I always regret not saving 2-3 months extra to get the better performing 70 series. They seem to be the sweet spot for price vs performance, even more so if you go with an AMD equivalent.",Negative

Was between 4060-7600XT-A770 this year, video games was a second focus but wanted to go more for productivity (in a budget). 4060 was fine, but the 8gb VRAM make me go for the other 2 options, mainly if I get to edit very big things in high res., it would be hard to do.  And between 7600XT and A770... The A770 gets 4070 performance on video edition, and Intel codes are far better than AMD. Gaming performance they are almost the same... So far very happy with my purchase.  Since the start of the year, doing the same workflow, with driver updates I got to shave a total of 5 minutes on each video render. At the start was 20m, rn is 15m with the same type of edition. And driver bugs? 0, enever needed to reinstall drivers.",Positive

Intel,I've got the A770 16 gig and it seems fine.  Hard to tell with games if it's my GPU or the game being next gen ready. I came from a gtx 970 so it felt like a massive upgrade. I remember Balder's gate being real low fps in act 1 on the 970 but very decent on the A770 at 1440. Hunt showdown also gets 90+ fps in busy areas but has had issues dropping to very choppy fps when things are happening close. With Hunt it's very hard to tell what the issue is as it has frequent issues that effect many gpus at the same time. Like a friend playing on amd had different issues at the same time as I did. Honestly couldn't tell you if I've turned the graphics up from low since I had that issue. A770 runs armored core 4 really well to the point that I haven't had to mess with any settings or check fps.,Positive

Intel,"Got an Arc B580 for the price/performance ratio, coming from an RX 5700 XT. Was a good bit of an upgrade in a lot of newer games. Honestly think it's a great card for that purpose.  Unfortunately, I ran into poor performance that was a no-go for me. Yakuza Kiwami had a huge issue (ran at like 50-55 fps with horrible lows that made it jittery, while my 5700 XT easily pushed 144, which makes sense, it's basically a PS3 era engine with better assets). From what I can tell, 0, Kiwami 2, and YLAD all had the same issue, and they got fixed over the course of a few years. The problem with that is that 0 was reported on the forum like 2 years before it was fixed. I was in the middle of a playthrough and couldn't just wait for reasonable, playable performance. I even tried DXVK and got a big boost (like 90-100ish), but it was still very unstable.  So you really do have to beware of older games still, despite the drivers having improved a lot and being overall solid. Some other DX11 titles ran perfectly fine though.  OpenGL performance? Forget it. Necesse uses Java and OpenGL and I managed about 70fps before using Mesa for Windows to get a boost. Still wasn't ideal compared to my 5700 XT, once again (and AMD isn't known for OpenGL performance on Windows lmao).  So overall, I think it's a great piece of hardware with mostly solid drivers, but it's not good enough for me on the driver side and I don't want to wait. It lasted 2 weeks before I returned it and got a 9060 XT 16GB (which is again a good bit of an upgrade from the B580, so the extra cost doesn't hurt as bad. I've been waiting for so long for an upgrade that made sense to me).  This was all in the middle of last month. Got my 9060 XT on the 30th.  I'd also like to note that they did alleviate most of the CPU overhead issues recently, so my 5600G wasn't an issue in games that did run well, like The Finals (actually ran extremely well with maxed out settings, and XeSS is actually really good on the Arc cards).",Positive

Intel,"No, I don't do a lot. The main goal wa to use it as a display GPU, but the AV1 encoding is a nice bonus. I run OBS in replay mode (10 minutes) in the background and this intel GPU is used for encoding.  I want my Nvidia GPU to not have any monitors connected to it, so I can switch between using it in my host OS and in the VM, here's an example of how it works: [https://youtu.be/3fiXFv85iRU](https://youtu.be/3fiXFv85iRU)  This allows me to for example stream a game directly from a VM to my TV and still use my PC to do something else, like for example few weeks ago we played Trine 2 with my brother, when I was running the game in both the VM and host (one copy on Nvidia and one on Intel) and we played multiplayer together.  I used to use the VM to play everything like year or two ago, but the Nvidia drivers on linux improved significantly, so nowadays I don't use it nearly as much, but I still do from time to time. Plus it's always nice to have a backup plan for running some anticheats.",Positive
Intel,"I'm using looking-glass. It's a bit different than parsec, it works by copying frames from the main GPU's framebuffer into the shared system memory segment and then to the 2nd GPU's memory. No compression and very low latency (I use virtual display in my Windows VM that I can set to 500Hz, which gives me around 2.5ms of added latency in total).  I also use Sunshine and Moonlight when straming to a TV or remotely to my laptop or phone. I have the cheapest server in OVH that I use as a VPN, so I can access my PC or share some services over internet (like my personal cloud for example: [https://cloud.yayuuu.pl/index.php/apps/memories/s/pKqfn86wLLy6xZM](https://cloud.yayuuu.pl/index.php/apps/memories/s/pKqfn86wLLy6xZM) ), so I can game from anywhere, just login over SSH to my home server, wake on lan PC, start a VM and connect using Moonlight).",Neutral
Intel,"Good point, I guess it isn't necessarily the best gaming CPU, but I quite like its speed for compiling etc.  Getting some 5xxx CPU seems like just a small step up and wouldn't be cheap. And anything even higher would mean basically replacing everything: Mainboard, RAM and CPU. Going with a lower core count and higher boosts might be better for gaming, but would feel like too much of a downgrade.  Ironically most games, which I play besides Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, are such old titles, that both GPU and CPU are complete overkill. And lately I found just far too little time for gaming in general to make it worth it with the current prices to get some DDR5.  Edit: I just checked and at least according to Wikipedia the Ryzen 5000 CPUs aren't clocked all that differently. Its successor the 5900X has a boost of 4,8GHz, but same core count and same L3 cache and same TDP.",Neutral

Intel,"Wait, if you don't connect your Nvidia to monitors, does that mean the thing you see on monitors is only rendered by the Arc?    So, is it like how you stream from game pass? Where you let other PC run and calculate the game (your VM in this case) and then stream the game on your host OS?    Are there advantages in doing this? How are the graphics compared to directly using your Nvidia?  When you say that you rarely play on the VM nowadays, do you mean your Nvidia is connected to the monitors? Or is there a way to split the task without VM?  Also when you played Trine 2, does that mean the game looks better on TV than your PC? Since Ark is weaker.  Sorry for asking many questions lol",Neutral
Intel,"😂 Just has less bandwidth, but still really damn good.",Positive
Intel,"It caps the bandwidth. But that's fine because it's not strong enough to even utilize the full bandwidth that 16 lanes would provide. And those extra lanes would just increase cost.   This *may* be a problem on an old motherboard, because 8 lanes of PCIe *may* be too little (idk, didn't see any tests). But 8 lanes of PCIe4 are more than sufficient.",Negative

That's basically what laptops are doing this with multiple GPUs. I just set these environmental variables in the steam's launch parameters: DXVK\_FILTER\_DEVICE\_NAME=""NVIDIA"" \_\_NV\_PRIME\_RENDER\_OFFLOAD=1 \_\_GLX\_VENDOR\_LIBRARY\_NAME=nvidia   and it will run on Nvidia. I can do the same with any other app, like browser, blender, etc. The screenshot shows an example of the game running bare-metal on nvidia-gpu and being displayed on intel GPU.  To not repeat the same parameters with every game, I've made a simple bash script that just exports these variables (and few more, like DLSS upgrade, etc), so I just type ""setenv %command%"" in steam lauinch parameters and that's it.  When running a VM, I use looking-glass, which is different than streaming the game to another device over LAN (like in your example with gamepass). Looking-glass uses shared memory to copy frames from one device to another, so it only works within one PC, but the video is uncompressed and with minimal latency (like 2-3ms of added latency). This is essentially the same path as offloading rendering but with one additional limitation - windows forces vsync, so I need to run as high refresh rate inside windows as possible to reduce latency. I use Virtual display adapter that allows me to set up to 500Hz and run desktop without any physical monitors attached.",Neutral
Intel,"Trine 2 is not that demanding, both GPUs can run it at max settings just fine. This is also true with a lot of older games. With new games it wouldn't work like this, but there is another way. Linux has a built-in multiseat, that allows logging in 2 different users at the same time, giving them access to different monitors, input devices, etc. I could use a 4k dummy plug to enable multiseat on that device and stream from there to the TV, but I don't have it configured right now, as I still need VM sometimes, so usually it's enough.",Neutral

Intel,"More like the transmission than the engine. PCIe lanes determine how much compute (horsepower) can get to the CPU (Road) so if your GPU (Engine) is performing really well but is bottlenecked by PCIe lanes, you aren't really getting that level of performance.

Intel,Seems a decent enough budget build. As long as you don't plan on doing any heavy gaming with it (i.e. titles with high recommended / minimum specs) it should serve you well.,Positive
Intel,"you can later upgrade to a RX 7700 xt or RX 9060 xt but you will be CPU bound at that point, RX 5700Xt is obsolete now but can pack a punch in that system, Nvidia 3060/ti too.  my recommendation would be the Rx 7700 xt or rx 9060 xt if you plan to upgrade later, at least you’ll have the gpu ready.",Neutral
Intel,it has RAM. thus it is a premium build.,Neutral
Intel,Sorry but the 2600 is dogshit look for a 3500x or 3600 on AliExpress they go as low as 45 bucks   Gpu wise 5700xt you can get for about 100 used,Neutral

Intel,Thanks!,Positive
Intel,Ok buddy,Neutral

Intel,Well I was thinking of Rx 6600 it's a good enough card for me.,Positive
Intel,LoL yeah in my country the shortage isnt affecting us which is pretty lucky (well not yet at least),Negative
Intel,I mean case is not in the photo and the peripherals like monitor keyboard etc.,Neutral
Intel,"Its a PC with 7-10 yr old parts. Its not gonna run any modern game. I dont know what kind of sugrarcoating you expected here, but 1/10 is about right",Negative
Intel,"6600 is similar to a Rx 5700 xt, if you consider pricing the 9060 xt 8gb is around the same price as the 6600 xt so I do not see a point in buying the 6600xt",Neutral
Intel,Maybe actually build the thing first.,Neutral
Intel,Yeah but that's the thing I'm not trying to start up black myth woukong with this thing and as I said it's a temporary card I will buy Rx 6600 when I get the money,Neutral
Intel,Yeah not in my country though it's a big difference in price over in my country between Rx 6600 xt and Rx 9060 xt,Neutral
Intel,Have you updated your BIOS? Sometimes helps with memory errors.,Neutral
Intel,"Are you overclocking or undervolting? This includes the AMD Curve Optimizer.  If no you can also try disabling XMP and rerun the memory test, see if that makes a difference.",Neutral
Intel,I’m not sure if it’s fixed yet or not but there were issues with the 25.11.1 driver version. I downgraded to what 25.9.1 and stopped having the issues you did.,Negative
Intel,"Not yet. Condidering doing that. Should I ?  EDIT : now runnning a MEMORY test on OCCT at 90%. So far so good, no more errors. Will update after a 10+ minutes test. Fingers crossed.   EDIT 2 : no error after 15 minutes. Thank you.",Positive
Intel,"No I did not over or underclock other than inside the AMD adrenalin program. But I got it back to default after getting those errors. But they keep happening.   Also, A-XMP is not active in my BIOS.",Negative
Intel,It may be helping but I mainly play with two friends and they have 25.11.1 too and they do not have such problems... So I am considering other solutions first. Thanks anyway for your advice.,Positive
Intel,"Remove all but one stick of RAM and rerun the memory test, see if you can identify whether the errors follow one or more specific sticks.",Neutral
Intel,"It doesn’t hurt anything to downgrade though? Also, 25.11.1 works for me now also but that was after a recent upgrade to an RX 9070 XT and R7 7800x3D.",Positive
Intel,"no no ofc it does not, but I tried updating my Bios (an advice I got from another sub before yours) and now I am running a memory stress test and it goes without all the errors I got before. After that I will try to play for a few hours and if the crashes still occur, then I will tried downgrading my adrenalin drivers.",Neutral

Intel,So is there any point to installing this if I'm on RDNA2 and don't have any of the issues that they fixed?,Negative
Intel,Is this worth updating to from 25.11.1  Is it more stable?,Neutral
Intel,I just tested the release on four machines (76X&78XT/78X3D&79XTX/97X&9070XT/75F&76XT). Every system still suffers from crashing drivers when hardware-accelerated apps are used (Chrome/Discord/etc.).  Please fix. :),Negative

With this driver if you enable ray tracing game hangs and give error.i already report bugs in 25.12.1 and same with 25.11.1 and amd does nothing. every ray tracing titles works ok with 25.10.1 driver and this is bad. amd does not listen users anymore. anyone has any crashes happen like me?thanks...,Negative

Intel,New update new problems,Positive
Intel,"This is a very underwhelming update for RDNA 4 users I get that this technology needs to mature, but they should already be at a point where the implementation is across more wide array of games.

Intel,"Still enjoying the piss out of the 7900XTX on 25.9.2. It chews through everything I throw at it at the settings I choose, don't care about new driver releases unless a new game I want to play doesn't play well on whatever driver I currently have installed.",Negative
Intel,"Guys calm down. RDNA3 being moved to maintenance mode is part of their new strategy, no longer ""Fine Wine"", the new approach is Stale Ale. That way their products remain DOA after launch and people won't keep them very long.",Neutral

Intel,I hope this fixes the many crashes I've had since the last update...,Negative
Intel,"Even tho I have a 9070xt this is still so underwhelming… We waited 6 months and got basically nothing yet. Sorry for all rdna2, 3 users.  Fun fact: Its been years now that the adrenaline software cant be opened, the only fix ist to press win+p and select only main monitor. Than start it, than swap monitor profile again…   Definetly buying nvidia next time, not supporting this big company anymore, which is behind in every aspect.

Intel,25.12.1 does not even install on my Minipc (780M) + 6650XT eGPU Setup.   I thought I might fix 25.11.X not opening in an eGPU Setup.   Guess I will be running 25.9.2 for another few Months.  God why something always break? I thought it would be better going all AMD for the eGPU setup.,Negative

Intel,I was really hoping AMD would implement Multi-Frame Generation because that is a great feature from Nvidia. I only play a few games with m+k so the latency doesn't bother me. The 9070 XT is a beast otherwise but the features are lacking in so many games. Also the ability to just upgrade fsr like DLSS override would be great too. Then we aren't dependent on the developer to implement the feature in older titles that lack fsr 3.1 or native fsr4 support. Take Alan Wake 2 for instance. It's still on FSR2 and really looks bad.,Positive
Intel,What a peace of trash. Fsr 4 quality looks dogshit,Negative
Intel,"Here’s the thing. You either need to address the FSR4/Redstone on RDNA 3 issue with a time frame or I’m just going to refund all my boxed RDNA 4 gpu’s, melt down my XTX’s, and go back to buying Nvidia cards because they’re better in everything but COD (which sucks). People do not support you because your hardware and software are better, they support you because of “AMD Fine Wine”.",Negative

Intel,"I can't speak on enhanced sync, but noise suppression is still busted and not working =/",Negative
Intel,Ok I thought I was the only one having the enhanced sync issue because no one replied to any of my posts about it. I use it because then I can lock my fps to 120 (on a 4K OLED TV) and use enhanced sync instead of Vsync because of the screen tearing when locking to 120. Now I have to do the frame lock to 117 which is fine but just annoying me I'm missing out on 3 fps lol it was causing issues in a few games where it would stutter like crazy and it all came down to enhanced sync. I don't use noise suppression so I don't know what's up with that.,Negative
Intel,"I'm piggybacking, because I need that info too",Neutral
Intel,Asking the real questions here,Neutral
Intel,"yeah my next one will be Nvidia, better features, better performance espacialy with RT/PT   And apperently longer support... and AMD cards in a simmilar performacne bracket don't even cost THAT much less sooo.... jeah I am mad aswell",Negative

Intel,"Mind explaining how AMD is being ignorant towards RDNA 3 users? They stated from the get go that RDNA 3 would not support FSR 4 right away due to the fact that it is hardware based and not software-based like FSR 3 and older, and that they might port it to RDNA 3 down the road if they can ensure performance doesn't tank. They never said they would definitively port FSR 4 to RDNA 3. Aside from that, RDNA 3 has been getting support for new Vulkan extensions and all the other driver-level features and optimizations. They've barely added any new features to the driver in recent months anyways aside from things related to FSR 4 and FSR Redstone so we're not missing anything of value anyways unless you really care that much about upscaling and RT. I don't use FSR or any sort of upscaling technology anyways; I'd rather drop my settings down to High or Med if I have to to ensure high frame rates without upscaling.",Neutral

Intel,"I had the same thing, but turns out my ram overclock was unstable (ive got 4x16gb @ 6000cl36)",Neutral
Intel,"Nope. Generally if the driver does not massively increases performance in some game, or you don't have any issues or the issue you have isn't fixed, then it's not worth updating, unless there is some new feature you want.    I reverted back to 25.9.1 (from the top of my head) because with any newer driver BF6 crashes randomly, and neither DICE nor AMD seem to give a damn about it.

Intel,"I think Linux developers are doing some experiments As of now, FSR 4 (FidelityFX Super Resolution 4) does not officially support RDNA 2 or RDNA 3 GPUs, even on Linux. However, thanks to Develer’s work on VKD3D-Proton 3.0, there is partial and unofficial support for RDNA 3 under specific conditions.  RDNA 3: Partial Support via Develer’s VKD3D-Proton  - Develer’s VKD3D-Proton 3.0 includes support for FP8 (8-bit floating point), which is required for FSR 4. - This means RDNA 3 GPUs (like RX 7600, 7900 XT/XTX) can run FSR 4 in some games via Proton, even though AMD doesn’t officially enable it. - Global override toggles in AMD’s 25.9.1 driver can bypass the FSR 4 whitelist, allowing it to run in FSR 3.1-compatible games.  I hope they succed it will be a slap in the face.",Neutral

Intel,"They repeatedly stated, Redstone is RDNA4 exclusive. Not sure what else you expected.",Neutral
Intel,"Your best case is your RX 7900 turning into Balsamico, whatever that means.",Positive
Intel,"Its because RDNA 4 added hardware that 3 and 2 don't have. Now before I get kicked to death by angry people, there is a version of FSR Redstone that uses and INT8 path that is compatible and will work on 2 and 3, however that has not been launched today and AMD have not confirmed it will be.   That isn't to say they won't do it, but right now it's not been announced. Perhaps there will be enough noise to get AMD to change their mind or it might be that they want to get it out on their latest cards first before complicating matters with older RDNA support.  Only time will tell",Neutral

Intel,"I’d wait on 5080ti with more VRAM but these are going to be obscenely expensive knowing nvidia + current RAM prices. Both 5070ti or 5080 are more of a sidegrade than upgrade, not worth the hassle IMO.",Negative
Intel,Get a 5070ti. I never thought I would say that. But this is what is is.. 9 months after release and the drivers are still D.S.,Negative
Intel,"I mean, I wouldn't get either. 5070 TI is a sidegrade from the XTX, and 5080 is only slightly better. DLSS and RT would be the only reason.",Neutral

Intel,both are still broken somehow,Negative
Intel,"If I could get my hands on a 5070 Ti I’d happily switch. AMD likes to take advantage of the underdog, for-the-people image whenever it’s convenient but they’ll just as quickly throw us under the bus and fuck us raw once they’ve got the bag.  Is Nvidia a gang of greedy fucks? Sure. But at least the bullshit’s right out front where you can get a good strong whiff of it. You know what you’re in for.",Negative
Intel,"I had Nvidia for years, the main reason I switched was that the drivers went to shit last year. I'm just sick of them in general, too. The 7800 XT I bought has been one of the most trouble free cards I ever had, aside from Adrenalin randomly closing in certain versions.",Negative
Intel,"How exactly does NVIDIA have better features than AMD? Aside from upscaling and ray-tracing related features (I turn off ray tracing anyways because it is additional eye candy that I just don't care about), NVIDIA relies almost entirely on DLSS and DLAA for any sort of performance improvements; their raw rasterization barely outperforms AMD until you go to the 5080 and above and even then the overall performance increase is negligible. And we all know how NVIDIA absolutely messed up their drivers with the 50 series when it first came out. And GPUs like the RX 7900 XTX still out-class the RTX 5080 in the VRAM department, and VRAM is becoming increasingly relevant as games demand more and more resources out of a PC. The only GPU that surpasses the 7900 XTX in VRAM is the RTX 5090 with its 32GB of VRAM, but that is an insanely expensive GPU that is literally in its own price class.  AMD doesn't have the financial resources or the budget in their graphics department to support older GPUS for as long as NVIDIA, because of their overall lower market share compared to them. NVIDIA got away with supporting architectures like Pascal and Maxwell for as long as they did because they had the user base to warrant it. AMD doesn't, so why would they continue investing budgetary/financial expenditures and labour hours into older architectures if the user base of these GPUs is small? But I feel like you and AlienIsGOD have a fundamental misunderstanding as to how GPU driver support works; they marketed FSR 4 as being exclusive to the RX 9000 series due to its hardware acceleration, aside from that RDNA 3 has still been getting new features incl. additional support for new Vulkan extensions.  However, AMD supported Polaris for quite a while even with the budget that they did in their graphics division, until version 25.8.1 of the Adrenalin driver released back in August, which means they supported it for almost a decade, and in fact they almost supported it for as long as NVIDIA did with Pascal (Pascal support was finally dropped with the most recent NVIDIA driver). And RDNA 1/2 are still supported as well.  Just because AMD hasn't been releasing new driver features on these older architectures doesn't mean AMD doesn't support their architectures; your take represents a fundamental misunderstanding as to how driver support works.",Neutral

Intel,"I believe the intention is that AMD Install Manager and Windows Update will always show the same driver version as the latest.  Previously, the update would come to Adrenaline prior to Windows Update. So, if you updated via Adrenaline, Windows would see the your driver is different than what it thinks is the latest and ""update"" you to the older driver.

Intel,"I don't know how much of an impact this could have on perf since it's not something I've measured. I personally wouldn't do this, though. With a dGPU installed I keep iGFX off.",Negative
Intel,"performance wise it should only be a couple frames of latency, when doing rendering on dgpu and going out through igpu it'll just copy over the frame buffers.   Main impact is on pcie bandwidth as it'll use up quite a lot there, and to a smaller degree RAM load, so you definitely don't want to run some other dynamic load on the igpu when gaming to overwhelm its pcie link. I think on 7000/9000 it's x8 so it may be fine? But I'm really not sure could be x4 too",Neutral

I'm tired of companies throwing shit ware on my PC, then when I remove it, they put it right back. Who are they to override my decisions on my own paid for property?  I dislike automatic updaters and 'additional installers' of any kind. How many bad updates get pushed through that end up adding problems or even worse, destroying data. In the case of drivers, how many drivers that come through that end up causing issues. It's why a lot of people use older drivers that they know that works.   But that's all honestly irrelevant.

Intel,"There might be legal hurdles.  The performance cost of the INT8 model is also extremely high, particularly for lower-end devices like integrated graphics. If a game is running at 250 fps (4 ms per frame) for example, and the INT8 model costs 3 ms to execute, that would require the lower resolution to run at 1000 fps (1 ms) before the INT8 model was effectively net zero in performance.",Negative
Intel,"but the overhead is still high. On a 35-40fps game, I'm not sure activating FSR4 with INT8 will be worth it. They are probably still working on reducing this overhead before implementing it with Steam Machine.  They should focus on releasing the whole suite of Redstone before looking at older hardware. Heck, one out of 4 ""product/feature"" they just announce is not even available for the 9000 series.",Negative

AMD took a different approach with RDNA2, evolved it again on RDNA3, and then straight up went for AI cores that have more parity with Nvidia's approach. Intel also had a more AI core centric approach with XeSS, so you can fairly criticize the decision making along the way for sure, but Nvidia has even began paywalling off what features in DLSS are available on each respective generation, with some other broad improvements being available. In essence, you can be just as mad at them for not even offering multiframe gen prior to 3000 series, and 2000 series will never see 4x multi-frame either. There are always trade-offs.",Neutral

Intel,"there won't be an ""fsr 5"" because any game with fsr implemented from here on out should, in theory, be compatible with every future version of fsr made, so numbering them isn't as meaningful. they're probably just going to stick with unofficial codenames like redstone for diffrentiation.

Intel,"There might be code or training data for which AMD lacks the appropriate rights. There might also be changes in the driver causing issues, seeing as FSR4 INT8 only works on RDNA2 with very old drivers, which might introduce new problems.  The performance cost doesn't make sense to measure in percentages. Upscaling costs some amount of time per frame, the costs are related to input resolution and output resolution as well as GPU performance. This is significant, because it means the performance benefit from upscaling is inversely proportional to the base framerate.  [Here's a test from a 6600XT](https://youtu.be/c3YWjqpQu-U?si=siE49iTbmtEU2K06). FSR3 costs \~0.80 ms, XeSS costs \~1.60 ms, and FSR4 INT8 costs \~2.30 ms. That's from 1280x720 to 1920x1080.   If you're at 5 ms render time at 1920x1080, and dropping the resolution to 1280x720 reduces the render time to 3 ms, then you will see total frametime with FSR4 INT8 Quality go from 5 ms to 5.3 ms, or 200 fps to 189 fps. This is not easy for people to understand.  Consider how someone with a Radeon 660M might be interested in trying some game with upscaling. Since they aren't technically inclined, they enable every performance-related option in the driver, including FSR4 INT8. Instead of FSR3.1 eating up 5 ms to upscale from 1280x720 to 1920x1080, they're now looking at 15 ms for FSR4 INT8!",Neutral
Intel,"its not worth it at low fps, there's a 2.3ms overhead.  if you play at 60fps (16.6ms) at 1080p. You lower your internal res with this FSR4 version and gain 30% performance. now you are at 78fps (12.8ms). Now add this 2.3ms cost, we are back to 66fps.",Negative
Intel,"I mean I would be pretty annoyed if I could enable something that caused issues because the hardware I have couldn’t support it   Whilst some of us have zero issues with tinkering with stuff, they also have to account for those who can’t and just want to play without messing with settings too much",Negative

RDNA2 fares worse for obvious reasons (lacks WMNA), in AI workloads RDNA 3 is quite a bit faster than RDNA 2. Also a 6600xt is just a weak GPU.   FSR4 should come to RDNA3, it works well on it. The 7900 XTX gets pretty close to 9700 XT performance in FSR 4 through INT8 (matches it in some cases).  RDNA2 is quite a bit older, weaker, and lacks WMNA, it's understandable if it doesn't get FSR4. Really no good excuse for RNDA3.",Neutral

Intel,"Honestly, I plan to make sure my next display has Display Port in it. Mostly for linux though.",Positive
Intel,"There will already be branching inside the code of the driver. This has been the case already, to various degrees, for years. It's not new.  It's just whether AMD wants to formally spread those branches out on a file / compilation level and distribute different packages. And then publicly whether they commit to updating all branches of code or only some.  For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch. Of course, we have very little outside insight into the exact spread of these cases that AMD wants to pay their engineers to work on.",Neutral
Intel,There is a separate code path for specific things bit both are in those combine driver. Its mostly about certain ray tracing extensions   There are also fp8 and fp16 codepaths    People misunderstand and thought its like pre rdna stuff.,Neutral
Intel,"V25.10.2  here… I have both CPU and GPU by AMD and if you download the specific package, they install drivers only for the specific hardware (and they have different dimensions). For installing both drivers you have to download the AutoDetect package.  EDIT: typo",Neutral
Intel,"I'm one of the 5 people still running a Vega 64 and for years we've had a separate driver ""branch"" despite being able to install new Adrenaline versions.

Intel,"Most likely when your distro provides a kernel update.  I'd give this a quick read: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-update-and-see-what-graphics-driver-you-have-on-linux-and-steamos/  Pretty much the default is that you will be using the Mesa driver collection and they were last updated yesterday.  The fixes there do not correlate with the ones in this thread (I think).  As long as you are on a ""cutting edge"" type distro then you can expect that update in the next few days/weeks.  If you are on a ""stable"" distro that doesn't update often, you may be waiting a realllly long time.",Neutral
Intel,"Get what exactly? Features? Bug fixes? Optimizations?   Every 2 weeks there are new Mesa driver updates with bug fixes and performance optimizations. As for features, you have to wait a few months for versions with big numbers (25.2 is soon updating to 25.3, adding Anti-lag 2).   Depending on your distribution, you can get these updates faster or slower.",Neutral
Intel,"Linux doesn’t work like windows. You get updates directly via Mesa stack. When your distro provides mesa package update, that’s when you get driver updates, and they’re completely different from windows branch.",Neutral
Intel,just uninstall it I prefer manual check myself.,Neutral
Intel,So AMDs default driver overclocks and doesn’t reflect that in the values?,Neutral
Intel,Same issues here i underclocked it but this new update just made it worse,Negative
Intel,ok it is still crashing ... complete reboot :(,Negative
Intel,"I feel like that crash is more on DICE's side, since Nvidia users get the same exact crash, although less often.  I tried everything I saw on the internet, nothing really works. Sometimes I can play for hours on end, other time game just crashes randomly after 10-15 minutes.  I am going to try to downgrade to 25.9.1 and see how it fares, since I remember that driver being really stable for me (6800XT).  Edit: been playing for 4 hours, no crash yet. Never had such a long session without the game crashing.  Will update in the next few days.  Edit 2: haven't crashed once, been playing at least 2 hours every evening.",Negative
Intel,Okay.,Neutral
Intel,I’m hoping Valve’s new steam machine will push them on that since it’s RDNA3 based.,Neutral
Intel,The RT/PT reflections leading to CTDs issue? We're working with CDPR to resolve this - it's not caused by the driver software.,Negative
Intel,"Stuff like this is honestly bugging me.  First AMD card and while it is okay to have some driver issues, stuff like that shouldn't be a thing at all. It can't be that some bugs keep existing for multiple months let alone more than half a year.",Negative
Intel,A much more fundamental thing like playing video in a window without stuttering took 3 or 4 driver updates.,Neutral

Intel,welcome to amd,Neutral
Intel,Yeah hoping it works. I guess the point about crashing with easy anticheat was the fix? Doesn't specifically mention but it was with raytracing enabled I was getting the crash. I suppose we shall find out.,Neutral
Intel,"Weird. I was running 10.2 and things were running fine for the most part. I kept getting a pop-up on launch saying there was a known issue with that driver and Arc Raiders though, so I rolled it back to 9.2 and had more issues on that release than the one with the stated problems.  My fan control profile broke and stopped tracking gpu temp so last night I did a clean DDU install back to 10.2.  Of course 12 hrs later the new release drops haha  Hopefully Fan Control continues to play nice if I just update",Negative
Intel,Same. Never even had Ryzen master installed.,Negative

Intel,The new AFMF features were added in 25.10.2 - Still waiting for AFMF 3.0 at this stage,Neutral
Intel,Suggest if you are using powertoys to stop... After their last game update it was crashing left and right. Powertoys was cause. I only crashed once and I believe it was cfeen blanking was cause for that. I was away too long.,Negative
Intel,"Fps drop over time? That's a game issue, it's got a memory leak",Negative
Intel,"What kind of FPS drops? I was having dog shit frame pacing, and hardcore drops to like sub 60 FPS at 1440p medium/high with a 6950XT. I went through every setting and found that anti-lag was the culprit. Once I turned that off it all went away. Then with future frame rendering it got even smoother.

Intel,are you able to install driver only with the newest drivers? When i choose minimal or driver only it still install full version of the software anyway. Only 25.9.1 works perfectly.,Neutral
Intel,Yeah... it can happen. I was already locked outside windows after a bsod with my old nvidia card. I had to use a linux usb drive to fix it through the command line.,Negative

It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.

Kinda miss the improvements for AFMF they brought with 25.10 for other games, but eh I'd rather play BF6 without it crashing randomly.",Negative
Intel,"Didn't test long enough to see if it crashes as I reverted back to old driver when I noticed my gpu was permanently at 100% load which it never was before on old driver, doesn't feel like it's supposed to do that with a 9800x3d & 9070xt + 32gb ram, It's moving between 70-95% usage on old driver",Negative
Intel,Either launch with curseforge or rollback,Neutral
Intel,"Damn, didn’t work for me last driver either. I can get FSR4 to work in other games just not BF6",Negative
Intel,Sorry for not replying in time with the pictures but I just saw that on Twitter that Beat Saber and AMD are now aware of the issue. The distorted flickering issue on the walls.  https://xcancel.com/BeatSaber/status/1993629046802882685  However there's another issue. I had not actually tried to use an Index at 90Hz until the other day. I discovered that the latency bug is back for 90Hz mode. As in I have to adjust the photon latency to ~5ms in the Steam debug commands to make it usable but not fixed. Just like in the the drivers before 24.12.1.   120Hz mode still works fine.,Neutral
Intel,"Even the rollback doesn't fix it for me now. It being related to the combination of iGPU and GPU makes sense though. Sadly I actively use the iGPU, so thats not an option for me.",Negative
Intel,You 100 procent sure on this?,Neutral
Intel,I went back to 25.3 official gigabyte latest driver for 9070XT OC gaming and 2 days no crashes for now. Also changed HDMI for DP cable  I will also change in BIOS and completely disable integrated GPU in BIOS,Positive
Intel,"I had auto update on (my mistake), so it did install over the previous driver. I've downgraded for now and it seems to be working just fine.  But no, after uninstalling from control panel I booted into safe mod and used DDU.   Then I downloaded the newest installer from the website. Restarting where needed during this process.   Didn't matter how I tried to access the software. Wasn't active in the system tray, not there in task manager.   Right click on desktop and open from there, click the exe, or go into a game and try Alt R. Didn't open with any of these methods.",Neutral
Intel,Driver with -s letter after black screen and reboot PC tells me that this driver isn't for my graphic card🤡,Negative
Intel,"I had randomly black screens with 24.2.1, this was annoying as hell. Had to DDU the Driver and went back to 23.11.1, after this everything was fine.",Negative
Intel,Does fsr 4 work on 25.9.1? I thought the only driver that works without having to change any files and risk a ban online is 23. 9.1?,Neutral
Intel,"I had to rollback to driver 25.9.1, start up Star Citizen, switch the renderer to Vulkan, exit game, start SC again to verify it's working with Vulkan, then reinstall the latest driver again. Now it works, just don't switch it back to DirectX. No idea who dropped the ball on this one but Easy-Anticheat sure doesn't like the atidxx64.dll.",Negative
Intel,I'm not sure. However when I install the driver it states that I cannot use adrenaline and gives me a link to the newest driver. Wondering if there is an earlier version of adrenaline I need to install.,Neutral
Intel,What do you mean extension update??? Do you mean lg firmware update or something Ina  windows update? Where do I find this?,Neutral
Intel,They do not.,Neutral
Intel,"Well, I used the system before the latest updates normally, for maybe half a year. Installed every update without DDU. I wanted to triple boot, formated the drive, left windows to install stock updates and drivers, went to install chipset and GPU driver and voila, every wakeup, just before I could type the pin, kernel panic and shutdown. DDU, just the driver, installed again, black screen. Went into DDU again, wanted to see if I missed anything and without reading, uninstalled everything AMD related, went into windows, installed chipset drivers from vendors site (ASUS) and then the latest GPU drivers, and havent had issues. I have a monitor connected via DP and a TV via HDMI.",Neutral
Intel,Dont buy an adapter. Most of them are trash and dont put out the advertised resolution and refresh rate. Not to mention most of them dont support vrr or HDR.,Negative
Intel,The one linked in the release notes is combined. (in the sense that it's two drivers in one executable) (And 1.6GB)  .....amd.com/drivers/whql-amd-software-adrenalin-edition-25.11.1-win11-nov-combined.exe,Neutral
Intel,"AND is taking away one additional driver feature per day, you say?",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, I’m talking about 25.10.2 (posted the other day here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/s/nNunS1QlFX ). If you go to AMD download page and select “GPU” you get a file that has a different dimension from the one you download if you choose “CPU”. If you do the following steps 1) DDU (or AMD CleanUp Utility), 2) install CPU drivers => GPU not recognized or with a generic driver. If the you install the GPU driver you get the GPU correctly recognized and a yellow esclamation mark on the integrated. To have both VGAs working at the same time I have to download the AMD Auto Detect package (the file name ends with “minimal_install), but Adrenalin App does not open.",Neutral
Intel,Thank you for explaining it before the rage baiters go nuts.,Positive
Intel,I've been following this one pretty closely. Unfortunately the fix *just* missed 25.11.1 release cycle; we hope to get this out in the next one.,Negative
Intel,"I have a 7900XTX and have this issue at times. It normally clears quickly on its own, but seeing pink pixels on the screen worried me that I had an issue with the actual hardware",Negative
Intel,"I totally understand. if you're running with an affected display config, you should be fine on 25.9.1 or the 25.10.1 preview driver for BF6. We'll get this out as soon as we can.",Neutral
Intel,"Appreciate you reaching out with this - that's an interesting data point to consider.  In this case, the quirky behaviour with HDMI 2.1 + FRL was attributed to a change made in the display stack, I don't think it explicitly involves display stream compression to repro, just high enough display bandwidth (though I could be mistaken)",Positive
Intel,"Interesting. I've been experiencing random BSODs on my PC too on a fresh Win11 install too, I was also suspecting it was something to do with auto HDR toggle but I didn't know for sure.  I'm running 180hz 1440 LG panel but I don't recall if it's using hdmi or DP. I've also never experienced BSODs until the last week or two, since i did a fresh install and I've had the same monitors/PCs for a long time.",Neutral
Intel,Don't apologise - this one is worth getting upset over. Hope it's fixed for you all very soon.,Negative
Intel,Was yours the DisplayPort config or HDMI? I may have a fix for this ready if you're available test,Neutral
Intel,Can you provide me some context? Are there any posts detailing the issue either here or at the chromium project side?,Negative
Intel,Already launched in COD 7,Neutral
Intel,"Im currently using dp 1.4 on my 7900 gre.  My monitor has 2.1 hdmi, so you’re saying i shoulf switch to hdmi?",Neutral
Intel,Some of us are using DP 2.1 though. DP 1.4 is a thing of the past.,Neutral
Intel,Are you sure? The steam machine has HDMI 2.0 and DP 1.4 listed in the specifications,Neutral
Intel,"Ah ok, that definitely makes sense if you're using a TV. Hope they straighten it out for you soon.",Neutral
Intel,What I did is get the 25.8.1 drivers shut off the fluid motion frames and in Windows set bf6 to run full power on your graphics card. Try some of those things and see if that helps you.,Neutral
Intel,"I tried to reinstall the chipset drivers, the same error, tried to install the drivers from gigabyte site the second screen worked but uninstalled adrenaline and it ran the auto update that disabled the secondary screen and the issue of no adrenaline opening came back, going back to older version, thanks AMD",Neutral
Intel,With the compiled leaked DLL you can use it on RDNA3 as well.,Neutral
Intel,"Wait until December, there's the 5th anniversary and they'll supposedly drop something new.",Neutral
Intel,For me playing it with path tracing on eventually the game crashes. Had no issues playing with ray tracing: psycho though.,Negative
Intel,Amen to that. Not a single crash since the game released on CachyOS. (9070 XT),Negative
Intel,Thank you! Exciting keen to see what it’s like,Positive
Intel,"It has nothing to do with the lack of vulkan support, even when fsr4 comes to vulkan, the game still needs ray regeneration implementation from the devs, you cant use optiscaler through dlss inputs, like you probably will be able to in fx alan wake 2",Negative
Intel,I suppose is going to be fixed as soon as Amd Redstone go out. Basically is going to add every tecnology that Path tracing needs to work. Off course the devs would have to implement them in the game too,Negative
Intel,"The issue is if you try to use path tracing. Which to be fair, you probably shouldn't unless the miracle of them getting Virtuous to implement Ray Regeneration in Cyberpunk happens.",Negative
Intel,yes i tried it ... maybe it is because of the 7800X3D ... i really dont know... i will wait for the next patch ... should come tomorrow 18.11. ... but i have read so many threads and i am not the only one...,Neutral
Intel,Hmm fair. For me on 9070XT if I had raytracing enabled it would crash most regularly on loading back to the menu after extraction which was annoying but at least not game destroying lol. But yeah annoying enough that I turned RT off entirely.   I hope this means I can turn it back on because the game runs well enough for it.,Negative
Intel,"Yes. So far, so good. I'm not 100% sure what fixed it.      I uninstalled both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master standalone applications. Deleted the ""amdryzenmasterv"" keys. Rebooted.  Then I installed Adrenalin and used the Ryzen Master installer in Adrenalin (Performance > Metrics > Install Ryzen Master).  I think this problem might have something to do with a handshake breaking between Ryzen Master and Adrenalin, after upgrading just Adrenalin.   From now on, I'll probably do clean installs, removing and reinstalling both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master, through Adrenalin Performance tab.",Positive
Intel,"My last two processors are ryzen amd, my last three video cards are amd radeon and next one will be amd also, nvidia has driver issues as well, to be honest.  But yes, some issues are too annoying and updating drivers is lottery at this point. I would advice against updating drivers unless you need it for specific new game or have the latest video cards - rx 9070 \[xt\]  or 9060 xt .  I should have sold the 7700 xt and bought 9060 xt 16gb instead but too late for that now and it has problems as well, so lottery as i said, its a risk.",Negative
Intel,"I see, btw I'm just telling the natural AMD trends on its major update/features on its GPU (kinda). Wish it coming sooner..",Neutral
Intel,lmao chill out dude go touch some grass,Neutral
Intel,Could be grounds for lawsuit… That’s funny!,Neutral
Intel,Because of MPO.,Neutral
Intel,yeah same with 25.11.1 25.9.2 works for me,Positive
Intel,"25.10.2 was the previous WHQL, so also yes :P",Neutral
Intel,"Huh, seems to be running in DX12 for me, as reported by MSI AB, and FSR4 is working",Neutral
Intel,Which driver version and does it still crashing?,Neutral
Intel,OK I will install it now and test it and get back to you. Give me 10 mins.,Neutral
Intel,Yuppp. It does not work on bf6 but it works on ark survival ascended for me. Seems it might be a bf issue. I saw ppl saying they were getting more fps with this driver in BF6 but I think they didn't realize it's using FSR 3.1 and not 4.,Negative
Intel,I'll work with the engineer from that ticket check if that issue has somehow regressed.,Neutral
Intel,We've not been able to reproduce this internally so far. Can you remind me which GPU (was this a 7900XTX?) + connectivity method you're using?,Neutral
Intel,Try using DDU to uninstall your current drivers and do a clean install of the 25.10.2 combined drivers if you havent already (you can find it here):  https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-25-10-2.html,Neutral
Intel,"Yup just need to say ""No""",Neutral
Intel,"whew thanks, good think i noticed it first before updating. i have 25.10.2 and 25.9.2 here and they both have windows 10 along their filename so i might as well asked.",Positive
Intel,I don't see how it would work on 23.9.1 lol,Neutral
Intel,"Did you use DDU to uninstall the drivers and then reinstall using a driver installer from the AMD website? I found this guide yesterday and it was extremely helpful, specifically step 8:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1lnxb8o/ultimate_amd_performance_fix_guide_stop_lag_fps/",Neutral
Intel,I did it this morning before the new driver and confirm chipset drivers were untouched,Neutral
Intel,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.  More people use HDMI than what people think and those TVs don’t always have a DP connector at all.,Negative
Intel,"ah, that explains it. Thanks. :)",Positive
Intel,"What if one does not check release notes? V25.10.2 point to different packages, for installing both CPU and GPU you had to download the AutoDetect package (named “minimal install”). Obviously I’m referring to AMD driver download page.",Neutral
Intel,"Okay, as long as they have a workaround for that... I was planning to get a 9060XT, but also keep my 6700XT for lossless scaling frame gen, was worried the branching would affect that..",Neutral
Intel,"What a mess. I have rdna2 and 3 on the same PC, so combined driver is the solution for this? Or auto detect is the only way?",Neutral
Intel,"Damn, that's a huge relief to hear. Most of the frustration came from not knowing whether the issue was even acknowledged.   Thanks a lot for the update.",Negative
Intel,What about Noise Suppression not working since 25.9.2?,Neutral
Intel,Finally. The last driver without pink artifacting was 25.4.1  It has been 7 months. AMD Matt acknowledged the bug on [the amd forums](https://pcforum.amd.com/s/question/0D5KZ000011WpJJ0A0/pink-square-artifacting-chrome-discord-and-steam) 5 months ago.  Please let it be fixed with the next driver update. So many 7000series users are on the verge of swapping to Nvidia.  https://i.redd.it/ywrg9at3lp1g1.gif,Neutral
Intel,"what about whatever changed post 25.3.1 for multi monitors? Any driver 25.3.1 and older i can run my main at 200hz, my side at 165, and my third at 60 without issue. Any driver newer than 25.3.1 and running my main at 200hz then playing a game will cause the second monitor (165hz) to flicker, glitch, and freak out the entire time, until the game on the main monitor is closed. Dropping to 165 on the main monitor down from 200hz \*fixes\* the issue but, i paid for 200hz and would like to be able to actually use it again.  (7700xt system)",Neutral
Intel,Hell yeah 🙂 amd I appreciate you see the issues Iv been a fan boy for a long time and I know it will be fixed,Positive
Intel,"Hi. Sorry, I thought this was pretty common as I've had this issue with two different systems and 3 AMD GPUs across 2 generations. [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1jayump/chrome_full_screen_freezes_after_switching_to_amd/) [Or here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/3890720/parts-of-screen-freezes-when-using-chrome) Chrome (or other Chromium browsers, I've had this happen with Edge too) in fullscreen, with graphics acceleration enabled.   Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind this only actually matters if one protocol or the other is **actually** limiting bandwidth for the [resolution * FPS] you want to display on your monitor  For instance, DP 1.4 can do ~25Gbits/s, which translates to roughly 1440p @ 240fps, or 4k @ 120fps  If you have proper cable into HDMI 2.1, it should be able to do ~42Gbits/s, which would instead be 4k @ 190fps  Read up the wikipedia tables for bandwidth specs and resolution / fps / bit depth rates for more",Neutral
Intel,Yeah most people are still have dp 1.4 monitors though. No way I'm swapping my monitor just for dp 2.1 as it's just too awesome. Although these tandem OLED screens look interesting... Hmm lol,Positive
Intel,"lol, listened too much to linus  https://youtu.be/g3FkuZNSGkw?t=261",Neutral
Intel,That was my very first actual driver issue I experienced with AMD.,Negative
Intel,Oh that's nice! I'll look into it when I get the chance.,Positive
Intel,Cool. Thank you,Positive
Intel,I might turn on ray tracing in like a medium or low setting just for shits and giggles or screenshots but I don't plan on playing with it on all the time since I'll also play at 1440p so I don't wanna have a really bad experience 😖,Negative
Intel,Exactly! It's insane. I can't believe running through a translation layer is more stable than running native,Positive
Intel,"but i dont know something is also wrong with 25.11.1 ... AMD Adrenalin randomly vanishes from tray     i dont want to roll back to 25.9.1 :-(    but this version was the last which was good so far      maybe when we have luck amd is able to provide next time a ""perfect"" driver without any issues?",Negative
Intel,"Could be it, nothing hardware wise at all and just software too.     Yeah, you're not the 1st I've read that says they have issues on the game.     If you're crashing and the system reboots it does make me think of some stability issues and not really just GPU, but I'm guessing you've already tried stability tests and using the system without OC+A-XMP/EXPO disabled.     Once upon a time I remember reading some people, on other instances and other games, having crashes like that (complete reboot) due to PSU instability as well.     Good luck!",Neutral
Intel,That's strange. My game defaulted to everything maxed out including running ray tracing and I haven't noticed any issues. The game runs incredibly well.  I've got a 5800X3D & 9070XT as well.,Positive
Intel,"Fair enough, and yeah sooner the better for all of us",Positive
Intel,It absolutely could be.  Europe has some pretty good consumer law and promising features that could impact your purchase decision are part of this law.  It can fall under misleading advertisement,Neutral
Intel,"It's not freezing, it's just that the GPU usage is practically at 100% all the time, even with V-Sync enabled. With the 25.9 drivers, this doesn't happen, and the clock speed varies normally, increasing and decreasing as needed when V-Sync is enabled. These 25.10 drivers are causing the GPU to consume more energy unnecessarily.",Neutral
Intel,Fingers crossed,Neutral
Intel,"Thanks for attempting to retest.  It's a 7900XTX with an Index connected via DisplayPort. I am on the latest 25.11.1 driver.  I run a monitor at 4k 120Hz 10bpc with HDR Off, which uses DSC, as my main and only display. I tried disabling DSC in the monitor settings which runs at 4k 120Hz 8bpc with HDR Off but I don't think I noticed a change in latency. I thought that DSC on and off on two different devices might contribute to the problem but I'm not sure.   I have also tried running the Index under a RX480 on another PC and I fairly certain the latency looks different under 90Hz and looks similar under 120Hz. Can't play much to test though as an RX480 runs the Index at a very blurry setting. Getting around to doing this test is what took me so long to reply.",Neutral
Intel,"Allright ty, will Install new, any differences in performance?",Neutral
Intel,"im running 25.11.1 on win10 7900xt. no problems besides afmf2 breaking the performance overlay, which ive had for multiple updates now",Neutral
Intel,I don't think you understand what I mean.. If you downgrade to that you can get fsr 4 to work on 6000 series without having to change any files.,Neutral
Intel,Thank you for this. This was very helpful. Got adrenaline working fine now.,Positive
Intel,"I wish my LG C4 42"" had a display port. Its my primary monitor.",Neutral
Intel,"Yep, AMD is not so quick in fixing their driver download page, I still can remember when X870E chipset came out but you found only X670 option.

I'll talk to a colleague in our display team about what we can do to learn more about that behaviour on your side - we might ask you to capture a special kind of log file during a state when your secondary display is blanking with gameplay on the primary",Neutral
Intel,Can you tell us what content you have on the secondary panel when it starts misbehaving? Is this behaviour affected if you disable VRR on it too?,Neutral
Intel,"I see. I recall the partial display freeze being related to DWM & multi plane overlay in Windows.

Intel,"Yeah, I'm facing the same issue on RX 9060 XT   Is it a GPU driver issue, or a Windows issue that Microsoft needs to fix?",Negative
Intel,since last BF6 Update i had zero crashes also on 25.11.1,Negative
Intel,"That's not how it works. Small print won't save you from stuff like this, you think that they can stop releasing this software for 2-3 years because some small print said 'Subject to change'?   European consumer law would absolutely support the consumer in this case. If you promise a feature by a certain date, you will need to deliver it.

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.

Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative

What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra.

AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software.

Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem.

Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't. Problems that Nvidia and AMD both solved decades ago that are holding Intel back in 2024.   It's not a mystery how a GPU should be built but that didn't stop Intel from not figuring it out.,Neutral

Intel,Doesn't make it less of a fact that users are experiencing issues and they still paid hard cash for those GPUs.,Negative
Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral
Intel,"This was a graphics card, not a ‘GPU’ in terms that we understand them now, just to bolster the point about how much of a disparity this comparison reveals.",Negative
Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so? They paid full price for a product and it should work as advertised.  With that said, the issues with Arc are widely known and complaining about it after the fact is a bit sillly at this point.",Negative

It makes me wonder if they have used older drivers, since they don;t even get 60fps rasterized at 1080p in some games.  edit: And I paid much less than the minimum price they are listing, I'd need to check if prices went up - even though computer base suggest that isn't the case.

Somebody else even made a huge post here and on r/linux, phoronix covered it slightly and AMD went into full panic mode, their developer advocate came here and on AMD forums and in emails and made many grand promises. Here we are almost 10 years later, same issues still exist.  Oh yeah, and BlackMagic (DaVinci Resolve maker) today officially doesn't support their software on any AMD hardware.

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Intel,"And I'm over here struggling to keep an Nvidia T4 passthrough to work reliably on Hyper-V to Ubuntu 22.04. :(  Is there a specific software combination that works more reliably than others?   Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.  They working with some kind of magic radiation over there?",Negative
Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.  You're free to guess what vendor om looking at to replace my CPU with. Damn shame really.",Negative
Intel,"Fact: AMD does not give a shit about any of this.   We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line. If all CDNA customers switch to NVIDIA and those PO's dropped in volume, it might make them care a little bit.",Negative

Intel,"I’ve been buying ATI / AMD since the ATI Rage 128, and I think my next GPU will be Nvidia. I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

Also some other games having driver timeouts to, but i have games that also never timeout.

I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.  Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical. I guess that's why nobody is already doing it.",Neutral

I think they're the defense of a brand like it they are defending their sports club.  We're stuck between the overpriced that just work, and the nightmare the AMD software overall is. I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?  ""I have had X AMD GPUs, with Y experience in computers, never had a problem!""  Or even better, ""That is because you suck at computers"" said by some NPC that doesn't even know what an OS is..  I really hope your letter gets where it needs to go, and please keep up the good job. I still hope AMD steers in the right direction so it can put Nvidia to shame(I want to believe poster here). Not because I have something against this brand or the other, but because we need competitors, or else you'll end up paying 600$ for a nice system, and 6000$ for the GPU.

How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with?    My own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures.",Neutral

Intel,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place. And if this is a feature that they do not want to support, having the documentation needed to self-support the feature.",Negative

Intel,"So maybe AMD should sponsor some development on widely used software such as Blender to bring it within a few percent, or embrace ZLUDA and get it to an actually functional state. As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",Neutral

Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture. Direct passthrough is also possible without too many hacks like AMD do(*cough* vendor-reset *cough*).  People always consider Intel graphics processors as a laughing stock but you gotta respect them for the accessibility of vGPU solution, directly on integrated graphics that everyone gets.

Intel,"It's more that I don't want to reward a business for failing me.  If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU  partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.""  ""I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any  reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU,  VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

Ive had a few hiccups that looked like driver issues that turned out to actually be Windows issues, and i always wonder if people are quick to blame AMD for issues because of what they have heard vs actually investigating and finding the real cause of the problem.

Until I made my prior posts here on r/AMD, AMD were not interested or even awake when it came to these issues. I have had direct correspondence with John Bridgman where he confirmed that GPU reset was not even considered in prior generations.  Of what use are these support contracts and the high cost of buying these cards if AMD wont provide the resources to make them function in a reliable manner.

My gaming stability issues were always caused by unstable RAM timings and CPU OC settings - since I upgraded to an AM5 platform with everything stock, I'm solid as a rock. My 7900XTX has been absolutely perfect.  There is an unfair perception in gaming with AMD's drivers where people think they are far worse than they really are - it's a circlejerk at this point.  Your issue is different (and valid), you don't need to conflate the known issues in professional use cases with gaming - it'll just get you pushback because people who use AMD cards for gaming (like me) know the drivers are fine for gaming, which makes you come across as being hyperbolic - and if you're being hyperbolic about the gaming stuff, what else are you being hyperbolic about?

From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.  Does AMD need to improve things?  Of course.

For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.

Intel,"Oh wow, this is probably the first time I'm seeing dual channel listed in the RAM section of specs requirements.",Positive
Intel,im more baffled as to why they are comparing a RX 5700 to a GTX 1070. Id have thought they would have said a RX 590 (instead of 5700) or RTX 2060 (instead of 1070),Negative
Intel,> Enthusiast   > 1440p [...] with FSR Quality [...] 60 FPS  1440p + xxxx Quality upscaling is just another way to say 1080p you cowards. It's 2023 and enthusiast level is 1080p @ 60 FPS.   Looks pretty though with the amount of vegetation.  I'm surprised that they put the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT side by side in a game that has forced ray tracing. I guess that's the advantage of being cross platform and AMD sponsored.,Neutral

Intel,This gives me hope that Star Wars outlaws will also have FSR 3. 🤌,Positive
Intel,60fps with balanced upscaling on a 4080/7900xtx … That’s not a good sign,Negative
Intel,It's joever. We are officially at the point where devs are using upscaling as the standard to reach playable frame rates instead of optimizing their games.,Negative

Intel,"Really disliking this trend of all new games having ""with FSR/DLSS"" in their PC requirements tables. The requirements should all be done without any upscaling or frame generation tech to be upfront and honest about how the game will run. Upscaling will then just be an available option for users to further increase performance.",Negative
Intel,"Actually not to bad for current standards, 1440p 60 with fsr quality on a 6800xt/3080 is great if high includes RT, if it doesn't then it sucks",Negative
Intel,"So with my 6800xt, which should be able to do 1440p high settings at over 60fps easily, I'll have to use FSR just to get 60fps? Great, another unoptimized game headed our way.  So sick of the awful PC ports and such. 6800xt is still a very powerful card yet I'm seeing more and more games require it for 1440p 60fps high or even 1080p 60 fps high. Ridiculous.  The reliance on upscaling tech instead of properly optimizing the game is becoming a problem. And it seems this game has forced RT which is idiotic. RT destroys performance and should always be an option.",Negative
Intel,"If you notice, all the mentioned AMD GPUs are significantly better than Nvidia GPUs, so does that mean bad performance for AMD GPUs?",Neutral
Intel,So i bought an 1200€ card (rx 7900xtx in my region and at the time of launch) and can now enjoy new games at 60 fps with BALANCED fsr upscaling. We love to see it. /s,Positive
Intel,so I'm doomed to use FSR even at 1080p ? what a shame pc gaming has become.,Negative
Intel,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?  (I'm not talking about this game in particular, just in general, it was same outrage w/ AW2 and that turned out better than expected)",Neutral
Intel,I hope they will bundle this game with CPUs/GPUs,Positive
Intel,holy hell so for 1080p you need a 1440p card because not even a RX 7600 is on par with a 3060ti or a 6700XT,Negative
Intel,Recently upgraded GPU and CPU and crazy that newer games are already requiring the newest GPUs to play them. Personally I don't think it's a horrible thing but at the same time it just screams horrible optimization.,Negative
Intel,This game better look like real life with those specs. I does looks beautiful!,Positive
Intel,"Another garbage with forced upscaling at baseline. When upscaling winded up - everyone was ""Hell yeah, high refresh rate AAA gaming""  Fast forward to today: ""FSR performance just to hit 1080p 60fps - yay..""   I fucking knew it.. it was so obvious upscaling will turn into this and replace game optimizations. Why optimizing shit, when you can tell people to turn on fucking FSR / DLSS / XeSS performance??   What a fucking shitshow... And few weeks back when I said I'm not gonna buy AMD GPU again because upscaling is getting mandatory and DLSS is just objectively superior - I was laughed in the face. Every major AAA game onwards will be shoving up upscaling as base line performance - so your typical 60fps marks (and 30fps - yes apparently that is still a thing on PC in 2023). There's no escape from this.",Negative
Intel,Damn. My 5700XT did Mirage fine on Medium/Low shadows. Now its basement quality.,Negative

With this being a based on a movie game, I don’t have super high hopes that that’ll be the case though. Going from movie to game and vice versa almost always has bad results.   Also, displaying system requirements with upscaling is a bad joke. This is basically saying you’re not getting native 1080p 60fps without a 6800xt or 3080. Upscaling is definitely becoming the crutch a lot of folks feared it would be.",Negative

Intel,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",Neutral

Intel,"I've hated upscaling since the beginning.   Now, it's being proven right in our faces that companies are no longer making 100% they're making 45% done games, and then they rely on upscaling and fake frames to do the rest.   Why have a fully optimized game that runs well natively when you can just lower the resolution by 3x then have frame generation help?   Full force ahead to frame generation= Every game will be optimized so badly that you're forced to upscale",Negative
Intel,"It’s literally right there in the hardware specs. 1080p fsr2 quality is 720p input resolution, so at native the game runs at 720p low on a 1070 or 5700.  It is the inverse of what reviewers have been doing with their benchmarks - if you are a fan who really has a stick up their ass about native res, just do the math yourself. They’ve given you all the pieces you need to calculate it out yourself, but that’s not how the game is supposed to be run so they aren’t going to put native res in the official marketing material.  Games are optimized around upscaling now and it is unhelpful and misleading to pretend otherwise. Rendering 4x as many pixels is *obviously* going to throw things off with more intensive effects, and lead to a generally unplayable experience.",Neutral

Intel,"people also forget both AMD and nvidia didn't really offer a generation leap in GPU performance this gen, sure it's popular to call games ""unoptimized"" (I know many AAA releases are, not denying that) but the issue compounds with the fact that game devs couldn't predict a GPU generation to be this bad caused by inflated crypro-boom margins a generation prior",Negative
Intel,"As with almost every game release recently, expect the game to perform a bit better than the requirements.    Sometimes the hardware can achieve 60 FPS most of the time but drops below that in other times, so the devs just say it's guaranteed 30 FPS and call it a day. If you look at the 5700 vs 6700XT, the gap is almost 50% in most titles, this means that if the numbers for the 5700 were accurate then the 6700XT will be getting around 45 FPS at 1080p low (unless the game utilizes special hardware only available on the 6700XT) but the game targets 60 FPS at 1080p high on the 6700XT which leads me to believe the 5700 is gonna perform much better which should leave room for turning off upscaling.",Positive

Intel,"I agree with this, that’s not that outrageous if this does include RT. Non RT would be pretty bad to need fsr but that is the quality mode.",Neutral
Intel,This is going to be the exact same situation as with Alan Wake. The game is going to come out and the requirements are going to make sense. People just aren't used to seeing games with mandatory rt.,Neutral
Intel,I would say pressured bc they announced it over a year ago and promised we will get it in september. Thats the problem with games an tech they all make promises and then cant keep the deadline. Just make smth new and when it works then announce it and make the last fine adjustments. If you make promises to early you set yourself up for failure.,Negative

So there's that 😉",Neutral
Intel,Timed epic exclusivity? Aww man.,Negative
Intel,Was guaranteed to happen when up scaling was announced... It's an excuse for less optimisation or to push fidelity more.  I saw a video of this avatar game it got an insane amount of plants visible at all times.,Negative
Intel,You... are.. joking... right..?,Neutral
Intel,Because it’s not coming to steam. It’ll be an epic games exclusive so everyone will pass on it until it hits steam in 18 months. At which point no one will buy an 18 month old game for full price and will wait for a 50% off sale at the minimum.,Negative

Intel,yup that is why I will play 1440 UW native with a 7900XTX.,Neutral
Intel,I guess they are confused with dlss.  Dlss 2= up scaling Dlss3 = frame gen  So they thought its for fsr3 too. ( as in fsr2 up scaling and 3 frame gen)   But fsr3 can do frame gen or not.  Fsr3 is up scaling and frame gen.,Neutral
Intel,"Likely mid range gpu and a suit yells in the background ""30 fps with up scaling is fine""",Neutral
Intel,"Likely the same, they didn't want to make the graph even more annoying, hence why fsr3 and rt and xess are mentioned top right.

Intel,For 30fps even lol,Neutral
Intel,"Especially recommending FSR.  DLSS at 1080p? Sure why not?   FSR at 1080p? Disgusting, absolutely horrific.  Anyone who downvotes this is a fanboy, end of story. Nvidia's DLSS simply is better at reconstructing an image. At lower resolutions that is SIGNIFICANTLY more important.",Negative
Intel,Or be happy your shitty video card is still supported.,Negative
Intel,and we still get shat on for saying they are or admitting its a bad thing. corpo fanbois are so cringe,Negative
Intel,Even 4090 users use DLSS because it fixes TAA problems. And has a sharpening slider for easy sharpening adjustment.,Positive
Intel,When did I ever complain about how expensive gpus are. I've always been in the category that they are luxury item and vendor can charge whatever they want for em. So you aint never hear me complain about gpu prices.,Negative
Intel,I can't market a game for running with 120fps 4k with raytracing on on a RTX 4060.  But I can market 400 completely identical missions that take up 150 hours of your lifespan and empty out your soul.,Negative
Intel,Yea I know nothing about optimizations and if it could or couldn't fix this or that. I just want them to tell me exactly what I need to run the game at X resolution a Y preset with 60 fps. If that calls for a 14900k and a 4090 then just say so.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, I think we're really beginning to see a trend here with abusing upscaling for free mileage.  Not that upscaling isn't great but...  Apart from RT, on medium settings, I can't really see    massive improvements on visual quality that would warrant such a massive increase on requirements.  UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  We'll probably see this continuing to be a trend for a while, and then as tech novelty wears out, some devs will come out with more optimized and scalable titles.  With hardware prices being as they are, and with 60fps now being highly requested in consoles as well, it's pretty much a given.",Negative
Intel,"People accepted upscaling with open arms, so now devs know they can rely on people using it. Thus they don't have to care about optimizing for native res anymore. Oh you have a 4k card? Okay well we'll make sure it can run the game at 1080p so you can upscale it.",Neutral
Intel,"No average consumer wanted to come to this point. The market leader started pushing upscaling instead of just making stronger GPU’s and there’s nothing AMD can do to win them, only join them.",Negative
Intel,Turns out TAA is worse than AI TAA with AI upscaling.   Of course devs are gonna use it to cover their own asses. And they get perf boost!  Let's face it. The FUTURE is AI everything. Nobody is gonna talk shit about frame generation and upscaling when it looks perfect each frame.,Negative
Intel,But it does in many ways.,Neutral
Intel,"I don't know who those people are. I play all my games on native, whether I'm using an amd or nvidia card.",Neutral

Intel,"You're even seeing this on console, where Spiderman 2 now has RT reflections in every mode. Even Unreal 5's Lumen renderer is a software raytracer that can be hardware accelerated.

Intel,"I thought that was on Linux, though I might be wrong",Neutral
Intel,1070 doesn't have hardware RT though.,Neutral
Intel,According to the technical director there's no non-raytracing mode. I'm assuming that means software ray tracing for the minimum spec.  Source: Skill Up video - https://youtu.be/v91y87R5iDk?t=332 (5m32s),Neutral

Intel,Damn my brain must have been on auto pilot. I'm so used to 2160p + FSR quality neatly equalling 1440p.,Negative
Intel,I see the 5700 and the GTX 1070 on the minimum specs. Are those cards going to be RT capable for this game? (It's 30FPS LOW with FSR but still.),Neutral

Intel,Yep. This company learned something from all the failure game launches that happened this year. The game companies can't just implement one gpu company's tech and not the others bc then it'll only work on the one gpu that you implemented the tech for and it won't work on the other gpus from other companies. Meaning for example if a game company only implemented fsr it's only going to work on amd gpus and not on Nvidia and Intel gpus and vise versa is true too for both Nvidia and Intel gpus for dlss and xess.,Negative
Intel,Avatar is RT only. There is no non RT mode.,Neutral
Intel,This is mad with snowdrop engine. It's Ubisoft they don't use unreal...,Negative
Intel,"Yep, I missed that. Good call! Makes sense why the specs are a bit higher then but if it is forced on, that's going to be rough on any one with a more mid tier card.",Neutral
Intel,">  Consoles use mostly FSR balanced  heck sometimes they use performance or less, heck a lot of the time even. Especially with RT or performance modes",Neutral
Intel,They have really long way to go. Take for example Lords of the Fallen - UE5's TSR is better than FSR. Take Alan Wake 2 and you get ton of shimmering on the edges. It's also not like nvidia not improving - so while AMD makes a step forward so will do nvidia..   There's also question how much they improve without dedicated accelerators that both Intel and nvidia is using. Intel jumped late to the party and they're already ahead - which just shows how much AMD cares. It's rally embarrassing considering both XBOX and PlayStation are also relying on FSR - ant that's bigger market than what nvidia has.,Neutral
Intel,I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?  I mean the facts are the facts. I need to play on lower settings till we get a 5070 or 8800xt.,Neutral

Intel,You will never see a high production game from Ubisoft ever on the Steam store ever again at initial launch.  They are the anti-christ of the gaming industry seriously.,Negative
Intel,Consoles are the baseline in most multiplat games and they've been using upscaling since forever. The real reason is just that we don't have GPUs anymore that are 10x faster than consoles like last gen. You can't bruteforce high resolutions in games that run at like 720p on consoles with GPUs that are only 2-3x faster.  If upscaling didn't exist on PC the minimum here would just be 720p at the minimum and 1080p-1440p at the max.,Negative
Intel,Next-gen doesn't mean that current gen can run it well. It means it's so far ahead that most curren-gen hardware can't run it properly + top-end hardware can only barely run it well.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly. These paid exclusive games launches only make me care less whenever they actually release.  It's not just Epic, Meta has done it with several games (Moss Book 2) and when a proper looking pcvr port comes a year later it sells bad because people forgot about it.",Negative
Intel,"Is that with significant RT? I assumed it was ""normal"" ultra settings.  Still I can play Far Cry 6 and RE4 with AMD sponsored RT at 4k native with 100fps. This game will have to look amazing to justify what... a quarter of that performance?",Positive
Intel,"You are correct. I overlooked the part where, under Ultra settings, it said that was with FSR2. Now it doesn't seem as bad. I mean, it's still not good because it's rendering somewhere between 1080p and 1440p, but at least it's not 30 fps without Frame Gen/60 fps with it like I thought.",Neutral
Intel,"It might be, AFAIK neither Nvidia nor AMD still support their implementation of it in their drivers.  But I've tried it on a few games and it is pretty cool to me, much stronger than almost any modern 3D movie (IMO why 3D has gone into hibernation), and I gather that Cameron designed the franchise around 3D.  Plus the Avatar 1 game was in 3D.  FWIW.",Positive
Intel,This is what I am thinking too.,Neutral
Intel,"You say that, but they specifically mentioned FSR3, and just DLSS, so i have a feeling DLSS3 will have to go via a mod again.",Neutral
Intel,"i have a believe that even 4C8T will survive for the decade, like the case of that 4790K. But turns out these newer UE5 games are wrecking even newish CPU like the 3600. i mean cmon it's still a 4 years CPU old which i think it's not old yet",Neutral
Intel,Let's hope so. 30fps is far from recommended for FSR 3,Positive
Intel,Yeah I heard it works with that hoping it works with fsr3 now,Positive
Intel,"I've noticed that for some reason newer games look blurry at 1080 even without any kind of upscaling and I'm not sure why, older game look much sharper at 1080p",Negative
Intel,"Just lazy optimisation, that’s pretty much a PS5 equivalent GPU and you can be damn sure that the console version won’t be 1080P 30fps with FSR",Negative
Intel,"No it says 5700. NOT 5700XT, and yes there is a difference. Quite literally the difference between a 1070 and 1080ti. Or a 2070 and 2080.",Neutral
Intel,no no my 7 year old card needs to be able to play at high settings. so does my low end card from today. gotta be high or its just bad,Negative
Intel,Crazy expectation? A game released in 2023 should be able to run at 1080p low 30fps on a low end card like rx6500xt (lowest end modern card you can buy now).  Optimization matters.,Neutral
Intel,"Yup, these cards came out around the time of ps4 I think..that's a long time ago in the graphical quality of games we are seeing.  People should be happy to a point that those cards can even run some of these games if upscaling helps them run that's a bonus as it means they don't need to upgrade if those graphics settings are acceptable to them.",Positive
Intel,"I have a 5700 and it does better at 1080p on these games than what is normally posted. Now it does need quality fsr but its not the worst thing, anything lower than quality is. Bottom line is these are not 100% correct and never have been.  I have zero interest in this game but the specs seem fine even though I wish upscaling wasn't what was relied on for optimization.",Negative
Intel,"well you dont know what they mean by 30 fps. It could be de 1% lows or the average, we dont know. The easy assumption is that it will be 30 fps average. but that's crazy that a game at 1080p low cant be run by a 5700. It better be a new Crysis.  edit: apparently it uses raytracing only for lighting which would explain the hows and why it crushes the framerate so bad especially on a gpu that doesnt have hardware raytracing like the 5700.",Negative
Intel,"Or in the case of games like Alan Wake 2, you will get unplayable fps if you try to running it at 4k native max settings. Even with a 4090, you will get a glorious 20fps.",Negative
Intel,Assassins creed origins and odyssey side quests/collectibles oh my god,Neutral
Intel,Yeah it doesn't give us a actual gauge to understand what we need for set native parameters. I mentioned optimization out of concern that they rely too much on upscaling and it seems like it's the lazy way out of something. It's unrealistic that a usable gaming experience be in a top tier hardware setup that costs $2k+ and top tier hardware of just the last generation are just barely cutting it anymore.,Negative
Intel,I appreciate your insights and opinions. Thank you.,Positive
Intel,">UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.

Intel,that's stoopid but it's somewhat more understandable. Why a 5700 would struggle so much since it doesnt have hardware raytracing,Negative

Intel,Some people seem to have very low sensitivity to added blur. See also *depth of field blur* and *motion blur* being on by default in every game.

Intel,It's a 4 year old cpu yes... But how it was built (4c) was like 10 12 years now old.  6 cores are since a few years already base and more and more 8 cores are standard.,Neutral
Intel,TAA,Neutral
Intel,Temporal anti aliasing.,Neutral
Intel,"TAA is the devil. it forces a blur on every frame, and only gets worse as the resolution goes lower. its why fsr, xess, and dlss can look better than """"native"""" because it doesnt use the horrid plain taa solution so many games do. and why dlaa, and fsraa are so important and need to replace taa completely",Negative
Intel,"Ahh, welcome to r/FuckTAA",Neutral
Intel,Even 4K looks blurry with some implementations of TAA,Negative
Intel,they're giving you the bare minimum until your upgrade!,Neutral
Intel,Because they are built with upscaling in mind so they have a blurry looks intentionally as it works best with aggressive upscaling.,Neutral
Intel,"Not even close, you're completely out of your mind. The 5700xt is 9% faster than the 5700. The 1080ti is **32%** faster than a 1070 and the 2080 is **19%** faster than the 2070.

Intel,"Well the difference is only 256 shaders more on the 5700xt. The 5700xt has 2560 shaders and the 5700 2304. That's 11% more. That's not that much.  The 1080ti has 86% more cuda cores than the 1070, as well as more and faster memory. I would not compare now so haha",Neutral
Intel,"The 5700 and 5700xt is more like a 1070 and 1070ti situation. It's not that big a gap, and you can close it even tighter because the majority of RX 5700 cards can be flashed to a 5700xt bios tightening the gap farther.",Neutral
Intel,"The 1070 was released in 2016. Its already the end of 2023. That card belong to ps4 era. Wake up.   People in this sub are delusional, really.",Negative
Intel,Those are some dumbass expectations. Maybe you should correct them instead of blaming the developers for it.,Neutral
Intel,"The 6500XT offers $200 2016 performance. In fact its often worse because of how gimped it is interface wise. Its one of the worst products released in recent years.  Its not the game developers fault AMD pretty much rebadged the RX 480 4 times and they can't be expected to sink their optimization to that level.  RX 480, RX580, RX 5500XT and RX6500XT are virtualy the same product performance wise. RX 5500XT is the most consistent one of the lot offering a somewhat more modern arhitecture in its 8GB variant. The 6500XT on the other hand while on a newer arhitecture is an unmitigated disaster that is on par at best and sinks even below the RX580 when memory, bus and PCIE interface constrained.  The console baseline is around 6700XT/2070 Super/3060ti level. People better get used to that as its gonna become or already has become the norm for 1080p high settings gaming. The 5700 is upwards of 30% slower by default while also having less hardware features. Its gonna become the minimum norm going forward alongside the 2060's of your time.",Negative
Intel,"the 1070 was 2016, the 5700 was 2019. While both not new its not 10 years old like the PS4 (2013)",Neutral
Intel,This is literally only true if you use path tracing. I think you're trying to insinuate the game is unoptimized when it just scales really high with visual features if your hardware supports it. It straight up runs great for the visual features it uses.,Neutral
Intel,"That was exclusive to console releases, no? And never to the point of replacing AA sharpening and rendering the game from 720p…",Negative
Intel,No I havent. AMD is bigger than Epic.,Neutral
Intel,"Right, you'll have different complaints but complaints none the less even though the new Ultra might still look slightly better prior gen games and offer high FPS but people would complain that the graphics are not advancing fast enough, they look the same etc etc.  Yah those days are likely gone but it's hard to say if it's because the game is unoptimized or if the dev is really pushing the limits of what they can do graphically and use upscaling as a buffer because what they have in mind, or what they intend to show is too taxing for current hardware. We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it. This is why I've never in my life ever pre-ordered a game. I still don't understand why people do it (esp now that games are digital) but lot of people do. Then again I've never really paid for a ""skin"" or some other visual add-on so maybe that's what attracts people.  I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets. The presets are all relative anyways. There's no universal settings that define what each preset represents.  I just don't get the outrage on these minimum spec sheets compared to what the game is showing graphically. At least wait until it releases and we have some hard data.",Negative
Intel,"I'm also a dev dood sometimes it's literally a ""foutage de geugle"" I had a friend who talk about how shit devs in EA (the people who's making the engine) code and doesn't optimise",Negative
Intel,"The commenter I replied to said there wasn't a big generational improvement for GPUs, while I said there was. But I agree that 4080 is expensive for what it offers.",Neutral
Intel,It was the same price as a 3090 at launch and offers 90% more performance.  It was definitely a generational leap.,Positive
Intel,It's software ray tracing which isn't accelerated by hardware.,Neutral
Intel,and i guess it can be hard to tell if ram is dual or single rank with just two sticks of it too.,Neutral
Intel,>might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.  I was pointing out that 1070 doesn't have hardware RT either.,Negative
Intel,So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?,Negative
Intel,"Why not make it toggleable though, you can choose other graphics settings so it makes no sense. Most people don't play games with RT enabled",Negative
Intel,Still kinda weird that they put the RX 5700/A750 on the same ballpark as the 1070... Being that the newer GPUs actually perform closer to a 1080(Ti).,Neutral
Intel,Sounds like improperly configured negative LOD bias. If you have Nvidia you can fix it with nvinspector. On AMD there's nothing you can do IIRC if Devs mess it up.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly what I'm telling them all the time, that I can see difference in textures, in hair, fences, powerlines etc. And every time I get downvoted by the army of ""but it looks better then native"". I feel like majority of that sub needs to go get a prescription for new glasses",Negative
Intel,"So if you stopped measuring who's bigger, why do you think I have no access to DLSS? Tested on rig with 4080 on a C2 42"" screen. Once you stop thinking with the tip of your head where probably Nvidia's logo is tattooed or maybe Jensen's face, who knows, you could come to realization that one person have access to more hardware then only his personal rig.  Do I say that FSR is better then DLSS? No! Both of them have their issues, but none of them is better then native. Keep on fanboying mate, instead of providing normal convoy as grownups",Neutral
Intel,I don't think YOU understand what you're talking about.  Did you seriously expect Snowdrop to be something used in like one game and then discarded completely?,Negative
Intel,"The thing is: creating good looking lightning with RT is much easier than with prebaked illumination. I can fully understand, why developers of new games are using RT as the basis of their game.",Positive
Intel,Minimum requirements go up as games get/look better. They probably made this game with the series s as the minimum. Low settings probably looks better than high in most games.   Rt for the last few years has been added on top of already complete games. Now games are being made with rt as the standard and they would have to manually do a ton of extra work to support 7+ year old hardware. It's the same as having to drop support for last gen consoles to be able to deliver a better game.,Neutral
Intel,"And still - superior upscaling makes it worth paying extra, RT on higher end is worth paying extra. AMD even this gen doesn't undercut price by enough, especially in EU where power efficiency also play a role. For example, assuming I'm gonna use GPU for 2 gens, then I save ~90-100€ with my usage just on electricity alone. I know it's over period of 4 years, but still it's price difference that will recoup over time, even if I have to pay extra upfront. AMD is simply no longer a value proposition.",Neutral
Intel,"They did not, lol - that fixes completely different thing, not the FSR caused shimmering edges.",Negative
Intel,Both excellent 👌 Down the Rabbit Hole was another solid one.,Positive
Intel,"RE4 came out this year.  Anyway the difference between us is I don't think any lighting effect is worth a $1,000 GPU using 1080p resolution and 60fps, but I know many disagree. That's life.",Neutral
Intel,"3600 and the 3300x was built with the TSMC 7nm if i recall, that was 2018 cutting edge tech. and somehow in gaming it's already obsolete. i was planning to replace mine with 5700x  but i cancel it because it's still very much capable for what i do now. but now after UE5 i think i'll reconsider it again, maybe even as far as 5800X3D",Neutral
Intel,It is crazy that I see everyone saying that modern games look blurry. I've known for years taa does this but it seems like I see more people than ever dissatisfied by it.,Negative
Intel,I have to turn it off in borderlands 3. Ugh.,Neutral
Intel,r/FuckTAA,Neutral
Intel,"My friend nicknamed it after his eyesight. When he wears glasses he has 20/20, but when he doesn’t he says that he sees the image about the same as without glasses",Negative
Intel,"Out of curiosity what resolution do you usually game at and at what distance? I find taa usually looks pretty good in modern games, but I'm also playing on a TV (48 inches but I'm not at monitor distance anymore). When I played on my 1920x1200 monitor I HATED TAA, well, not as much as fxaa, but moreso than smaa, and I missed msaa or SGSSAA with a passion. Now on the TV at 4k (lol, usually not on a 6700xt), 1440p, or even 1080p I find TAA can do a pretty decent job paired with varying levels of the Radeon sharpness adjustment in the adrenaline drivers. But again, probably due to viewing distance.  Looks leagues better than FXAA and I prefer it to SMAA now. But again, I'm sitting further away and tweaking sharpening to my liking. FSR2 seems to be a wash most of the time but the performance gain is worth it.",Positive
Intel,You dumbass do understand that even the console version of the recent games are total mess? Alan wake 2 have to run on reduced settings to even reach 30fps on xbox/PS. Callisto protocol used to have frametime issue on consoles. Console ports still targets 30fps on quality settings with upscaling while target should be 60fps with 120fps for performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, seems you are correct, it was the ps4 pro that came out in 2016, still, I wouldn't expect that to be capable of running some of the games we are seeing now without some serious compromises.",Neutral
Intel,I never said that Alan Wake 2 is unoptimised. I just said that even a 4090 can’t max out the game at native 4K resolution.,Negative
Intel,epic is tencent...,Neutral
Intel,"In terms of absolute numbers sure, 3090 always had a stupid price tho for being 10% faster than a 3080.   In terms of performance per dollar the 4090 even at 2x 3080 performance was worse value since you pay 1600 not 1400.",Negative
Intel,"Yes, you either have to get the spec sheet of the RAM modules (That even then it may not specify if it's a single/dual rank module) or test it in a system and use HWinfo/CPU-Z. Not as straightforward as dual channel that's mostly just using two identical modules.",Neutral
Intel,You don't need RT hardware to do software RT. That's what I'm saying.,Neutral
Intel,"For this particular game, there is a software fallback. Also, even if we did get a game that mandated hardware support for RT they'd still likely build it with console in mind so even RDNA2 GPUs shouldn't have issues",Neutral
Intel,"The first RT/DLSS capable cards are 5 years old now, way older than the current consoles. You are definitely not being left behind if you're only outdated by 1 gen lol",Neutral
Intel,I mean the last non ray tracing cards were released 4 years ago (1650/60 and 5000s from AMD),Neutral
Intel,Games running poorly on computers weaker than current gen consoles isn't exactly anything new.,Neutral
Intel,"No, you have multiple generations of games from prior to raytracing to enjoy.  Games shouldn't be held back forever just because someone wants to game on a GeForce2 MX400.",Negative
Intel,You are stuck playing older games. Unless someone can find a way to disable it with a mod.,Negative
Intel,> So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?  A gen old is second gen RT e.g. rtx 3000.  We're halfway through the third RT/matrix generation right now.,Negative
Intel,Yes hah,Neutral
Intel,"The 3090 or 6950xt will very likely run this game extremely well, they're a gen old.",Positive
Intel,"For the AMD GPU, it's probably because minimum will be the max it will support. Medium probably requires Hardware RT.  For Intel, I don’t know. Perhaps it signal not so great optimization for Intel GPUs...",Negative
Intel,DLSS is very strong in thin lines like fences & hair. Much better than most TAA solutions. Not sure about FSR in general.  An example: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6erA6BVkAAuf_M?format=jpg&name=large  Only DLSS resolves the lines properly.,Neutral
Intel,"I mean, it's not that black and white. Quality upscaling to 1080 will obviously be more noticeable than 4k. Maybe you *can* tell the difference between 4k native and dlss quality, but people aren't gonna believe you unless you prove it with some kind of blind test, but I doubt you'd be willing to go out of your way to do that.  Even if you could, the benefits of better aa might outweight some negligible drop in textures or whatever it is upscaling reduces. Though that's irrelevant when DLAA or NAA are options too, I guess.",Neutral
Intel,"Test, which one looks better, explain.  https://imgsli.com/MjE3MzEy",Neutral
Intel,Oh man the hair... its so crazy how much upscaling kills the hair..,Negative
Intel,i mean they already arent the smartest bulbs considering they went team green.,Neutral
Intel,Reading comrehension dude.,Neutral
Intel,"I do, but thanks for your interest.",Positive
Intel,That will depend on the user. Power is cheap here in canada so none of thar factors into my buying decisions. And rt will depends on the games you play also not everyone plays tripple a games.,Neutral
Intel,"You need to get 23.20.17.05.  Fixed Issues Intermittent flicker may be observed on some textures while playing Alan Wake 2.  Fixed for most people, also has a nice performance boost of about 10fps from what I'm seeing.  That being said I always prefer native resolution unless absolutely necessary. So far only had to use it in Martha is Dead.",Positive
Intel,Nice. It’s on the list. Thanks man,Positive
Intel,Yes.... 7nm was but 4 cores the actual important thing was obsolete like 10 or 12 years ago.,Neutral
Intel,Probably because TAA is (unfortunately) more prevalent than it ever was.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, most people are FINE with it. Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  The thing is, you have sharpening filters today. You can adjust the sharpening for TAA. You can make it look oversharpened if you want. There's driver level sharpening for both AMD and NVIDIA. Both also have software sharpening filters.  And DLSS and FSR bot have sharpening sliders.  There's 3 ways to adjust how blurry and how sharp the game looks for everyone. It's a non issue and even Digital Foundry acknowledges the benefits of TAA for game devs vs things like the blur. At the end of the day, these games are looking great...in this era, with exceptions. Not all games are blur. The whole blur thing was like in the past 4 years since upscalers started and TAA became the norm. But with all the sharpening options, and with devs actually used to making TAA not so soft looking, things are definitely getting a lot better for TAA.",Neutral
Intel,Oh my bad if I read that wrong,Negative
Intel,And I'm saying 1070 doesn't have hardware RT so it's just as gimped as AMD cards when doing RT.,Negative
Intel,Still pretty annoying nonetheless. Until it's stable no way should it be forced upon a game when someone's willing to run it normally at native.,Negative
Intel,"and the 2080ti is still winning, best purchase in gpu i made in a long time.",Positive
Intel,imagine being mad that 4 year old cards arent high end,Neutral
Intel,I'm on a 6700XT. 🙇. I just feel very shocked that I would probably need a gpu upgrade soon. With the demands of new games. Also 1440p ruined me.,Positive
Intel,"Technically makes sense, but they can just make RT something you can toggle between Software/Hardware and they also could just add the Vega 56 in the requirement sheet being that was AMD's competitor to the 1070 or they could've added the GTX 1080(Ti)/RTX 2060(Super) into the sheet.  On Intel's side they only have the A580 as the closest GPU to a 1070, even when it's too similar to the A750 performance wise :/",Neutral
Intel,"It is that black and white for me. I can immediately see the added image softness from upscaling, and it's especially prevalent with DLSS 2.5+ unless you enable a sharpening filter. DLAA also has weird issues like blurring textures (almost like it reverts to initial mipmap) while moving, usually at mid-distance from camera. It's too distracting and I have to go back to regular TAA. Immediately goes away.  1440p to 2160p is better than 720p to 1080p, but it's still noticeable. Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible? No. Actually changing monitor resolution outside of native and having all UI elements scaled looks terrible. That was what we used to do and upscaling is much better than that alternative. LCD panels need to stay at native signal resolution and GPU should scale render resolutions.",Negative
Intel,"And you look at static image all the time while gaming? It's different story when movement is involved, that's where you find all the artefacts you get. Static image doesn't tell a thing when it comes to gaming",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, and that's driving me crazy. I really couldn't stand it in Cyberpunk (in other titles it's either hit or miss), that I play it in native 4k instead.",Negative
Intel,"Wouldn't phrase it like that tough. I had that choice too in January, and actually by going 4070Ti instead of 7900XT I would be able to play Cyberpunk in higher fidelity and better frames then on mine, because AMD cooked FSR3.0 almost a year in the oven, and God knows how long it will take for CDPR to add it to the game, if ever considering that active development on game is ended and they are on bug fixing sprint right now. Also AMD needs to fix FSR in general, because how it works with smaller details like hair and fences is awful. But don't get me wrong, I love my card, just feel I git sold on features that would come handy right kow instead of when I don't need them anymore",Neutral
Intel,"Sorry mate, guess I need to read comments early morning instead of late night, just saw that last bit. My apologies. I'm just tired of upscalare wars whatever sub I go, and green team fanboys screaming that ""FSR is shit, DLSS is better then native"" and then throwing around static images for comparison",Negative
Intel,"It's for textures, not object edges from FSR use, lol. Two completely different things",Neutral
Intel,"people echoing the same shit like ""ooh 4C is obsolete, you need to upgrade that geriatric cpu"". 4C is still solid for gaming (ofc no UE5) and literally anything beside doing compute intensive professional workloads.",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening makes the image less blurry, but it doesn't recover the texture detail lost from TAA blur.",Negative
Intel,"""Even Nvidia foundry""   \---   they are like chief proponents of blur-tech and they don't care about how sharp and easy-to-see the image is. TAA flattens the image so you can't see which objects are far and which are near, you have to strain your eyes and mind to determine that which is unbearable to many. Just give us option to disable it even if it breaks some effects (which is just lazy thing to do on the side of devs)",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening fixes blur, not clearity. That is TAA destroys+add significant ghosting no matter the implementation.      Sharpening looks was worse than the normal cleairy of games, it's not the same thing at all.      >Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  We are mad because it being forced 1 and 2 it's being used to hide lazy effects that break without temporal frame smearing. People are now punished for turning off forced frame smearing.",Negative
Intel,And I'm saying that maybe the GTX 1070 is better at even software RT compared to AMD cards with no RT hardware. GTX 10 series card did get RTX support through CUDA even though they were horribly bad at it. Older AMD cards with no RT hardware didn't get any support like that from AMD.,Neutral
Intel,"You're not forced to use upscaling though. Unless you replied to the wrong person this is about ray tracing, which can be run at native just fine. If your GPU can't handle RT at native res, then just use upscaling.",Neutral
Intel,The minimum requirements for this game includes de 1070: a 7-year-old gpu from 2016.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm not really shocked, and was out there telling people not to buy those cards on day 1 in large part because of their deficiencies in RT performance and complete lack of matrix accelerators (which Nvidia and Intel have both made a large part of their architecture and got shockingly good results with - DLSS and matrix-XeSS are twice as good as FSR)",Negative
Intel,5700 was probably the lowest AMD card they had to test with.,Neutral
Intel,"It also looks better in gameplay, less ghosting, less shimmering, less aliasing.   So which one looks better? You clearly see the difference in textures/fences/powerline, right?  I even made it easier for you, both images are 1080p output.",Positive
Intel,I personally didn't try DLSS even once but FSR 2.0 does have shimmering I notice to various degrees. It was very noticable on fur in Ratchet & Clank cutscenes for example. Overall I am just happy my 5700xt could still keep up with 1440p.,Positive
Intel,Hmm yeah whatever you want to believe and let's you sleep.  Have a nice day.,Positive
Intel,AMD CAS is aimed to restore detail,Neutral
Intel,"They aren’t chief proponents of anything, TAAU has been popular for well over a decade at this point and it’s the default approach for consoles (checkerboarding has moire and aliasing issues) and digital foundry simply recognizes this is the reality of how the console world has settled on doing graphics.",Neutral
Intel,The problem with Nvidia is they are massively overpriced. One 4080 would probably cost the same as my whole build or more.,Negative
Intel,"Yes I see which one looks better, and as I said before it's a static image. While I didn't use upscaling in this same exact example, I can go by my own experience and tell that it doesn't look better then native let's say in same Cyberpunk or any other game. And I will beleive my own eyes on my own screen then static images tossed around. TBH, in my opinion it all depends on screen and screen size too, as to me that difference between upscaled and native was less noticible on my old 27"" 1440p screen then it is now on 42"" 4k. DLAA tough, that's another story",Neutral
Intel,"I tried both, and neither of them are better then native as people tend to claim. In my testing FSR have big problem with smaller details like hair, fur, fences, powerlines and as you mentioned, you get severe shimmering effect. I really hope AMD will keep on working on it, an try to get away from that. But DLSS also adds shimmer, it's just less visible then in FSR (atleast in my testing on Cyberpunk pre 2.0), and whatever upscaling method I've used I also could see that image is upscaled (lower res textures here and there etc.). I like idea being upscaling tech, it helps prolong life of GPUs, and for more powerful GPUs to run higher settings with more fidelity, but there's still work to do on them as they aren't perfect yet.",Negative
Intel,Yeah but a 3060ti didn't,Neutral
Intel,"In Cyberpunk you are not comparing upscaling vs no upscaling at the same settings though. You are comparing low RT native vs path traced upscaling and at 4K, the decission there is absolutely clear. On my 4k OLED screen, upscaled PT is so clearly the way to go, there is no competition.",Neutral
Intel,"The gameplay looks exactly like the image + your typical TAA/DLSS smearing. And as I said, in my example DLSS also looks better in gameplay, because as you see... native has a ton of aliasing which is super noticeable while playing (shimmering). There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling. Talking about native is nonesense, just image quality counts and thats were DLSS or even FSR 2 (some games) gets better and better. There is a reason why consoles use it... it looks better than without it.",Positive

Intel,"I mean, Path tracing is to Ray tracing, what Ray tracing is too rasterization.",Neutral
Intel,When Cyberpunk first came out the 3090 only got 20 fps in RT Psycho mode.  https://tpucdn.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-founders-edition/images/cyberpunk-2077-rt-3840-2160.png  Still does  Fast forward just one gem and you don't see anyone saying its demanding with many able to get RT Psycho on thier cards as new cards got faster.  Give it 2 gens and you are going to get 4k60 here.  Gpu will improve and get faster.,Neutral
Intel,"Look at that, my 6700XT is just 19fps slower than the RTX 4090 in this title.",Negative
Intel,It's a good thing nobody has to actually play it native.,Neutral
Intel,Well good thing literally nobody is doing that…,Positive
Intel,The future is not in native resolution so this is really pointless information.  Cyberpunk looks absolutelt mindblowlingy insane with all the extra graphical bells and whistles it has gotten over the years and with Nvidia’s technology it runs so damn smooth as well.,Positive
Intel,4.3fps lol. No amount of upscaling is going to fix that and make it playable. People were saying the 7900xtx had 3090ti levels of RT when it launched. A 4060 ti is 50% faster then it.,Negative
Intel,That's actually pretty amazing for any GPU to get a metric in frames per second instead of minuites per frame.,Positive
Intel,"Meh I get like 90+ fps with everything cranked with RR, FG and DLSS(Balanced) toggled on with my 4090 @ 4k.  Path tracing does introduce ghosting which is annoying buts not really noticeable most times but at the same time with RR enabled it removes shimmering on 99% of objects that is normally introduced with DLSS so I am willing to compromise.   Honestly as someone who used to have a 7900XTX I am disappointed with AMD its clear that AI tech in gaming is the way forward and they just seem so far behind Nvidia now and even Intel(going by some preview stuff). FSR is just not even comparable anymore.",Negative
Intel,Who cares when it looks worse than with dlss and ray reconstruction on top of running a lot worse? Native res 4k is pointless.,Negative
Intel,"Well the upscaling in this game is really good, DLSS with ray reconstructions AI accelerated denoiser provides better RT effects than the game at native with its native Denoiser.  Also Path tracing scales perfectly with resolution so upscaling provides massive gains. using DLSS quality doubles performance to 40fps, and dlss balanced gives 60fps on average, performance about 70-80 or 4x native 4K, that includes the 10-15% performance gain RR gives as well over the native denoiser as well.  I've been playing with about 60fps on average 50-70. with DLSS Balanced and RR and its been amazing. I don't like frame gen tho since it causes VRR flickers on my screen",Positive
Intel,"Running Ray Tracing or Path Tracing without DLSS or Ray Reconstruction is like intentionally going into a battlefield without any gear whatsoever, it's absolutely pointless and suicidal, what we can clearly see here though is top of the line 7900 XTX losing against already mediocre mid-range 4060 Ti by over 50%, which is just beyond embarrassing for AMD Radeon.  All this says to me is AMD Radeon need to get their shit together and improve their RT / PT performance, otherwise they will continue to lose more Marketshare on GPU department no matter how hard their fanboys thinks that they are pointless features, just like DLSS was back on 2020 right?  Also, with my 4070 Ti OC i can run it at average of over 60 FPS at 1440p DF optimized settings with DLSS Balanced + Ray Reconstruction without even using DLSS Frame Gen, with it on i can get over 80+ FPS",Negative

I've tried many times with different ray-tracing options and they all look good and all. But in the end I closed them all, turned back to Ultra Quality without ray-tracing and started playing the game over 120FPS.  This is a good action fps game now. I need high fps with as low latency as possible. So who cares about ray-tracing and path-tracing.  Yeah ray-tracing and path-tracing are good. But we are at least 2-3 generations away for them to become mainstream. When they are easily enabled on mid-range gpus with high-refresh rate monitors, they will be good and usable then :)",Positive

Imo, the more AI-upscaling you have to turn on, the worse the Nvidia purchase is.   I have a 6900XT and I will readily admit that the RT experience (ultra RT, no path tracing) at native 1080p resolution is ok, like 30-45 FPS (around 50 on medium RT settings), but if I turn RT lighting off (so RT shadows, sunlight, and reflections are still present) suddenly I get pretty consistent 60 FPS (i left my frames tied to monitor refresh rate, so 60 FPS is my max) and i can't tell the damn difference at native 1080p compared to RT medium or Ultra.

Intel,"Once they introduced this dlss upscaling anti-lag all these gimmicks I don't think we've seen true 4K native and almost anything lately.  This is maybe one game that does look that good but many of the games don't look that great and have some really serious system requirements when there are games that look much better and are much better optimized.  Companies are taking shortcuts, instead of optimizing they give you suboptimal and use FSR dlss all these gimmicks.  Don't get me wrong I always thought it was great for people who wanted to reach a certain frames per second someone with a weaker system to allow them to play at least the minimal at a steady frame rate.  It just seems like this is the normal now non-optimized games.  The 4090 is a beast if you could only get about 20 frames native with Ray tracing it tells you everything you need to know about Ray tracing.  It needs to be reworked that needs to be a new system I believe one real engine has it built in in a certain way probably not as good as Ray tracing directly.  To me it seems like ray tracing is hampering many games that tried to add it, too much focus on that instead of actual making a good game.

But the FG in CP2077 is decent with 60 fps output, ~~and I get ~65-70 fps output with quality DLSS + FG at 4k on a 4090.~~ EDIT: I misremembered what I was getting. With path tracing, DLSS quality, frame generation, and ray reconstruction, I got 80.1 fps with the benchmark!  Of course there's the matter of latency, and the latency of CP2077 with FG output of ~65-70 fps isn't great. So I'll often use DLSS balanced + FG. Thanks to ray reconstruction, this now looks very close enough native 4k (to my eyes), with acceptable latency (to me), at a high framerate output.",Positive

It's not about being a fanboy of amd, but ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick, not because it's unnoticeable or bad, just because it's not ""popular"" (I myself really like it). I would personally go amd over nvidia because those 50 or so euros more that nvidia has against the amd counter parts simply are too much for just better rt and  dlss. I could spend those for a better amd card with generally better performance.  Regarding dlss, personally I would just lower the graphics before resorting to kinda bad generated frames, fsr even worse. But that's my point of view.  I find that amd still has to fix some driver issues but other than that, they are a fine brand. (so is nvidia)",Neutral

Intel,Fanboyism of both kinds is bad,Negative
Intel,"It won't end, but hopefully we see games that have art designed with RT lighting and reflections in mind.  Cyberpunk isn't it. We'd need a full rebuild of the game, every location, every asset and surface remade, so it looks like originally intended by the artists.",Neutral
Intel,Since it needs more than 10gb vram,Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is more optimized than majority of games that came out in last two years. Just because you can't run it at 4k 120 fps with path tracing doesn't mean it's not optimized.,Positive
Intel,It’s not unoptimized at all. Game runs great for the quality of the graphics. You guys just don’t understand the insane amount of power path tracing takes. The fact you can do it at all rn is insane but once again people just throw “unoptimized” at it because they don’t understand the technical marvel happening in front of their eyes.,Negative
Intel,"No, this game is actually very well optimized. It's just extremely demanding at 4k native, which is why DLSS exists.  It would be unoptimized if it ran like this while looking like nothing special, but this is probably the game with the best graphics, period. At the very least, it's certainly the game with the best lighting.",Positive
Intel,"and people will be like ""well RT is the future""  raster was fine for over 15 years and raster games look great but we get it we must let incompetent game devs and their bosses make shit quality games because average gamer is ready to spend $100 to pre-order electronic version of horse shit and then justify it for years because they can't admit they wasted money",Negative
Intel,It's settled that you have no idea what you talking about,Neutral
Intel,Its full path tracing u cannot really optimize this much.,Negative
Intel,"It always did. Most games don't scale well, Cyberpunk does.  Look at the last two years of pc ports and you will understand how cyberpunk looks and performs like it's black magic.",Neutral
Intel,"Baked illumination requires you to choose where to add light sources and how the lighting is applied to everything, it's a creative choice of the author, the AI needs instructions to know what to do, so it would need constant handholding, on the other hand RT uses simple physics to calculate how light bounced and NN to apply the light on surfaces.",Neutral
Intel,But the destructable environment and the water graphics and other things in Direct X 9 made high end pcs kneel as well.  I remember playing on my 9800gtx/+ with my Intel Q9300 quad core (lapped and oc'ed to 3.0ghz - EDIT: checked some old evga posts got it to 3.33ghz) with 2x4gigs DDR2 @1000mhz cas 5 trying to maintain a sustained 30fps at 900p resolution on my 1680x1050 monitor. And I oc'ed the crap out of that 9800gtx 835 mhz (cant recall if it was unlinked shadder or not now) core on blower air (won the silicon lottery with that evga card).  Tweaking settings was mostly user done and guided with old school limited forum help. Ahh the good old days of having lots of time during school breaks.,Neutral
Intel,"The equivalent of a 4090 at the time, 8800 ultra (768MB) got 7.5 fps at 1920x1200 very high quality. The other cards were not able to run it. Even the lowest tier last generation card runs this, even though it's at 5% speed.",Neutral
Intel,No and no again lol  The 8800gtx could do 1152x864 high and that was the top dog. DX9 cards could do that at medium but high shaders was like a 25fps average tops and that dropped into the teens on the snow level.   It took things like the gtx480 and HD 6970 to do 1920x1080 30fps max settings. That's before getting into Sandy Bridge being the first cpu that could sustain 40+ fps if the gpu power was there.   Crysis came during the core 2 duo/k8 athlon and first wave dx10 cards era and it took *2 more generations* of *both* gpus and cpus to do it some justice.,Neutral
Intel,"My 8800ultra was getting single digit fps at 1080p ultra, so CP isn't quite as demanding.",Neutral
Intel,Amd had a tessellation unit. It went unused but it was present,Neutral
Intel,"My fun story for PhysX was Mirrors Edge. I don't remember what GPU I had at the time but the game was pretty new when I played it. Ran fine for quite some time until one scene where you get ambushed in a building by the cops and they shoot at the glass. The shattering glass with PhysX turned on absolutely TANKED my framerates, like single digit. I didn't realize that the PhysX toggle was turned on in the settings. This was at a time when PhysX required a dedicated PCIe card in your system.   Once I turned it off it ran fine. Now I can run that game at ridiculous framerates without my system getting warm.",Positive
Intel,"I remember around about 2008 when companies like Asus and Dell were selling ""Physics Processing Units"" and some claimed that these would be commonplace in gaming machines just like Graphics cards had become 10 years previously.",Neutral

Intel,>PhysX  It never was a dedicated Nvidia card - it was a [dedicated psysx](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/bfg-ageia-physx-card/) on which the tech later was bought by Nvidia and implemented in it's own GPU's.  But the things never became really populair.,Neutral
Intel,"This makes me wonder if we'll ever see something similar with Raytracing, where we get a 2nd GPU purely for RT, and then the main GPU just does all the other stuff. Would that even be possible?",Neutral

Intel,The ray/path tracing in this case done by specialized hardware which has more room to grow faster.,Neutral
Intel,"I would, transistor shrinking isn't the only method of increasing performance, and honestly, these companies have to keep putting out better cards to make money.  There have been many breakthroughs over the last few years. I give it another 5 as both amd and nvidia are pushing ai accelerated ray tracing on their cards, nvidia is in the lead for now but amd will eventually catch up.",Positive
Intel,There is still a big leap possible since all lithography processes at the moment are hybrid euv and duv.   But the moment everything is done euv things will drastically slow down.,Neutral
Intel,"No those are just pennies in the pocket of Nvidia, but as the consequence you as the customer need to take a mortgage on a brand new GPU.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah the next 10 years are gonna be spent getting budget cards up to 4090 level performance, rather than bringing the bleeding edge to 5-10x the 4090 performance. As long as 4K is king, there’s not much incentive to do the latter.",Negative
Intel,"In 10 years we will be begging one of several thousand test-tube created Musk Family members for $200 so we can buy a cheeseburger.  But the jokes on them, we’re just gonna spend it on space crack.",Neutral
Intel,"Never. Even if performance can be pushed that far, by the time it happens there won't be such a thing as a $200 graphics card anymore.",Negative

Intel,"They just need to render the minimum information needed , and let the ai do the rest",Neutral
Intel,"Don't get upscaling, to me it looks shite. Why spend hundreds or thousands on a GPU to not even run at native resolution.   It's something Nvidia are pushing because they've got a better version of it at the moment.  Maybe it'll improve, it's pretty much snake oil currently imo.",Negative
Intel,"Feels pretty good with 120 frames. Playing with a controller, i don‘t mind or even feel the input lag on a projector screen.",Positive
Intel,"It's mad that even with a 4090 running games at 4k, they still look less realistic than the low-res FMV sequences in The 7th Guest from 30 years ago.",Negative
Intel,"Do keep in mind that despite both being named the same, the devil's in the details. Movies use way more rays per scene and way more bounces too.   Path tracing in CP2077 shows temporal artifacts due to denoising, something that doesn't happen in movies. It is being improved with the likes of DLSS 3.5, but it is still quite off when compared to said movies.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind the systems that rendered toy story 1, costing upwards of like 300k IIRC, have less power than your cell phone today and were super delicate/finicky machines. There's a dude on youtube that got a hold of like the second best one that was made at the time and the machine honestly was really impressive for when it came out, but it pales in comparison to even a steam deck really.",Neutral
Intel,"> Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story  Toy Story didn't use path tracing though, A Bug's Life was Pixar's first movie to use ray tracing (not path tracing) and only for a few frames in the entire movie for specific reflections, they started using ray tracing more generally for Cars and I can't find exactly when they started using path tracing but it should be around the early 2010s which is also when the other Disney animation studios started using path tracing",Neutral
Intel,No it's not a miracle. Because it's downscaled a lot and also uses lower quality math and piggybacking on AI to make up for it. It's basically running through 3 layers of cheats to produce results that aren't that much better than just traditional raster.,Negative

Intel,4090 getting 60fps at 4k balanced dlss with no frame gen. 100 with frame gen. I can make it drop into the 20s if I stand right next to a fire with all the smoke and lightening effects or if I go to a heavily vegetated area it’ll drop to mid 40s. But it’s stay consistently at 55-65 and even goes Into the 90s if I head out of the city.   Haven’t tried it at quality or with dlss off though. May go do that now that it says only 19fps lol. Have to try it to see for myself,Neutral
Intel,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-dlss-35-tested-ai-powered-graphics-leaves-competitors-behind  Well it's so close (54fps) it's more like a 3080Ti or higher from 3000 series or a 4070TI + from 4000 series it seems? The old 3000 series is punching way above it weight vs the 7900xtx, which was meant to deliver similar RT performance to the 3090.. which it doesn't.",Neutral
Intel,At some point the RT pixels are so expensive that native resolution w/o DLSS and frame gen is just not gonna work for the time being.,Negative
Intel,"On the other hand, if you set the new DLSS 3.5 to performance (which you should in 4k), and just enable frame generation, you get 90+ in 4k with basically zero issues unless you pause to check frames.",Positive

Intel,Only people who don't give a shit about high quality graphics don't care about ray tracing.,Negative
Intel,I got a stupidly good deal on the 4090(buddy won an extra one from a company raffle) and it just so happened my XTX was one of the cards suffering from the mounting issue on release.  Honestly very happy that all of that happened. Sure I would have been happy with the 7900xtx if I got a replacement but the 4090 just kinda blew me away especially with all the DLSS tech behind it.,Positive
Intel,"Nvidia used cp77 as a testing grounds for their dlss3 and rt tech, it'd no surprise it looks and performs relatively good, they literally partnered with cdpr for that.  Do not expect these levels of RT on most games anytime soon, probably in a couple years (with rtx 5000 series) the tech will be more mature and not as taxing for most cards, because needing to upscale and use framegen to get 60fps on an RT PT setting is kinda absurd.",Positive

Intel,"There are a lot of new games that features Ray Tracing on them as of now, too bad most of them doesn't look as visually as good as they could be though as most of the time their RT effects are dumbed down or reduced to the point it's pointless.  But the thing is that wasn't the point even from the beginning, RT Overdrive on Cyberpunk is literally considered as a Technological showcase  What matters here IMO for all of us is PC platform in general is showcasing here what a real high-end computers can achieve beyond what current gen console can do, and they are showcasing it really well here on Cyberpunk with much better visuals and using plenty of tricks to make them more than playable, where they shouldn't be considering how much demanding they are over standard, that is impressive enough to me and shows a good sign of technological engineering innovation.   As what Bryan Catanzaro said on his interview on DF Direct, work smarter not harder, brute force is not everything, of course it still matters a lot but doing it alone is starting to become pointless just like how it is on real life.",Negative

Intel,Nice but ive been playing video games since the 70s and its Shit end off..,Negative
Intel,The future of frame generation is going to be huge. I can definitely see 360p frame rendering upscaled to 4k with 80% maybe even 90% of the frames being generated. All with equal to or even better visual quality.   A 20 FPS game like this will become a 100-200fps game.  We may be looking at the end of beefy graphics cards being required to play games. Just a good enough mid or low tier chip (granted 5-10 years from now) with frame generation might be enough.,Positive
Intel,"After 2.0, it's around 100""fps"". Just 60""fps"" (meaning with FG enabled) is far from being playable due to latency. You need at least 90""fps"" for playable experience.   Cyberpunk PT vs RT is a huge difference in terms of graphics, while DLSS Quality vs Balanced is really slim in comparison. What you say would be a really bad trade-off.   At 1440p DLSS Quality it's easily 120+""fps"" which is perfectly comfortable.",Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is greatly optimized. It looks fantastic for the hardware it asks. Starfield looks like game from 5 years that asks hardware from the future.,Positive

Intel,Pixar movies will sometimes take the better part of a day to render a single 4k frame on a render farm. So the fact that Cyberpunk takes more than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame in its path-tracing mode on a single 4090 clearly means that it's unoptimized garbage! /s  EDIT: Apparently people in this thread don't understand sarcasm (or don't understand how a path-traced game can take longer than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame with high-poly path tracing and still be optimized).,Negative

Intel,LOL I remember this exact scene also.,Neutral
Intel,"CPU PhysX back then was single-threaded and relied on ancient x87 instructions if I recall correctly, basically gimped on purpose.

Intel,"No, you could actually install two Nvidia cards and dedicate one of them to only PhysX.",Neutral
Intel,"It would certainly be possible, but it wouldn't really make sense. Splitting it up on multiple GPUs would have a lot of the same problems that sli/crossfire had. You would have to duplicate memory, effort, and increase latency when you composite the final image.  It may or may not make sense to maybe have a raster chiplet and a ray tracing chiplet on the same processor package on a single gpu. But, probably makes more sense to have it all on one chiplet, and just use many of the same chiplet for product segmentation purposes instead.   A separate PPU did make sense tho, I'm still annoyed that the nvidia ageia deal essentially kill the PPU in the cradle. Our gaming rigs would cost more if PPUs became a thing, but we could have had a lot better physics then we do today. There is still a revolution in physics to be had some day...",Neutral
Intel,would be cool if 2000/3000 series users could get a small tensor core only PCIe card to upgrade to framegen,Positive
Intel,"That's true, but if he's talking about *the equivalent* of a current $200-class card, I'd say about it's 10 years, what do you think?",Neutral
Intel,At least with the 4090 you can run 70% power target and still hit insane FPS while only pulling around 300w which is the same as my old 3080. The gains with that extra 150w are a couple percent at best. Not worth it to me.,Negative

Intel,"They are still the same thing and should be named the same, your disclaimer is just semantics about the implementation.",Neutral
Intel,"Weird argument.  Traditional raster is cheats upon cheats upon cheats already.  In fact, all of the lighting entirely in raster is essentially cheats.",Negative
Intel,It will not work well/look good using a single frame worth of data either due to the low ray counts. Digital Foundry has shown Metro Exodus builds the lighting over ~20 frames or so and it seems like Cyberpunk is even more. Even Cyberpunk ray pathtracing doesn't look as good in motion due to that same build-up effect.  You need to cast 20-50x the rays to have enough data for a single frame but then you will be measuring the game performance by seconds per frame.,Negative
Intel,"RT looks significantly better than raster when it’s not just using simple reflections like a Far Cry 6. Raster is all cheats, the so called reflections are essentially rendering the scene or part of the scene being reflected in reverse then applying fake material effects to mimic metal, water, etc. Raster also takes HUNDREDS to thousands of person hours to get the fake reflections and lighting to look decent to good. That’s why devs love RT and want it to grow, as RT/hardware does the work for them.",Negative

Intel,It's not a perfect way of measure but you can clearly see how (at least on Nvidia GPUs) the 8/10GB cards are way behind the >11Gb cards. Meaning you need 11 or 12GB of VRAM for this scenario which cripples the 3080 but not the 3060.  We said from the start these configurations are shit but no-one listened. There you go.,Negative
Intel,The crypto miners did me a comical solid by preventing me from acquiring many countless times and hours I wasted (came from a gtx1070 before finally being able to upgrade). Was able to get my 6900xt eventually for around $600 with 2 games. Becoming increasing thankful for the extra Vram these days.   Once I start getting through my game backlog and into the gard hitting ray tracing ones will hopefully upgrade to something with at least 24gigs of GDDR# lol.,Positive

Intel,"I expect path tracing support to be the exception for a while because most developers will consider the non-trivial dev time to implement it not worth it. However, I'm sure Nvidia would be willing to throw dev help at most developers who would be willing to implement path tracing with their help.  Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090). That's substantially faster than than how fast a 4090 runs Cyberpunk on the path tracing mode. Presumably, a less complex world helps, but they may also have implemented opacity micro maps, which I'm not sure if Cyberpunk has done in the 2.0 update. Perhaps they're cherry-picked examples for the trailer.",Neutral

I wanted better cooling performance after upgrading to the artic freezer 7 as well with those weird crapy plastic tension clips you pushed in manually, fearing bending them (worse than the stock intel cooler tension twist lock).

Wanted the multhreaded for Crysis, LoL (back when you had to wait 5min+ to get into a game), BF2, and was eventually playing TF, Day of Defeat and Natural Selection.  My upgrade back then was to the Evga 560ti DS, which I ended up installing a backplate and  a gelid cooler. They had wayy better thermal tape/individual heatsinks for the memory/vram chips for the heat transfer.

Intel,"There was more nuance to that ""bugfix"" than just ""it was a bug that got fixed""   Modders were able to re-enable the AMD/NVIDIA PhysX combo basically immediately via editing DLLs.  Not driver replacements, but actual DLL tweaks.  The speed at which modders were able to fix what NVIDIA ""broke"" combined with the public outrage put them in a funny legal spot.  If they continued with PhysX disabled and claiming it was a bug then the bug can easily be fixed, as shown by modders doing it first.  So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.  Obviously not many modern games use the GPU implementation of PhysX anymore and the performance difference between current GPU and CPU implementations are negligible anyway, but their intent at the time was clear once it was shown how quickly modders were able to get everyone back to normal.",Neutral

Intel,I like how you said: static image  because in motion upscaling is crappier,Negative
Intel,"It isn't a weird argument. Rasterization is premised on approximating reality, while RT is simulating it.  The extreme few amount of rays we trace right now, including bounces, means effects are often muted and the performance hit is enormous. To compensate, we're using temporal upscaling from super low resolutions *and* frame interpolation.  Temporal upscaling isn't without it's issues, and you know how much traditional denoisers leave to be desired. Even Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction leaves a lot to be desired; the thread on r/Nvidia shows as much, with ghosting, artifacts, etc. all over again. It's like the launch of DLSS 2.0.  All of that, for effects that are oftentimes difficult to perceive, and for utterly devastating traditional rasterization performance.",Negative
Intel,"It's a shame raster is so labor intensive, because it looks so interesting when done right.     I look at screenshots from cyberpunk, Raster / Ray Trace / Path Trace, and in most of them the raster just looks more interesting to me. Not constrained by what would be real physical lighting. The 100% RT render versions of old games like Quake gives a similar feeling.     But I imagine there will be more stylistic RT lighting over time, it saving a ton of labor is all things considered good, freeing it up for actual game design.",Positive

In HDR that ""bloom"" looks awesome as it's super bright like it would be in real life but still not losing any details. You lose those details only on those SDR videos.  PT just looks and feels way more natural than just RT, when only raster literally looks like it was two different games from two different hardware generations.  Once I saw Cyperpunk PT there is no way I'd imagine playing this game in any other way. All other games look absurdly ugly next to it now.

You’re in denial if you think otherwise.  I’m not tied to either brand. I have an AMD CPU bc it was the best option for what I wanted, and a Nvidia GPU for the same reason.

The 4060ti gets 6.6 fps. Let's assume a next gen flagship is able to reach 60 fps at 4k. That would theoratically allow the 60ti card to reach around 20 fps.

Intel,"While I haven't used it daily or anything, and I've only done initial setup on the Lunar Lake, the feedback we've gotten both on Arrow Lake and for Lunar Lake (e.g. 268V and 265H) Dell models is that it's a big increase in battery life and performance. The integrated graphics (e.g. 140V and 140T) are very capable compared to a **workstation** grade NVIDIA Ada 500 GPU, but they are not even comparable to a gaming GPU like the GeForce 4060 or even a 5050.  The integrated graphics do however get used for 99% of all workloads unless explicitly specified because they are vastly more battery efficient and draw less power compared to a dedicated NVIDIA chip, meaning you can have a much smaller external power supply, and your graphics performance in those basic desktop workloads with one of these chipsets will be **much** better than previous generation Intel chips. Exceptions are obviously something like gaming or AutoCAD that specify to use the high performance dedicated graphics chip.  140V/140T are barely functional for modern AAA gaming, but if you stay 5-10 years back for AAA titles you might be okay. It will smoke most Indie games. Just look at the per title benchmarks for a 140V/140T and you can see if your game benches. You could probably get away with a lot of functional mobile gaming without a dGPU, but I wouldn't expect to be able to play a recent Call of Duty or Black Myth or anything with anything like an acceptable framerate at a decent resolution. This integrated graphics chip compares very favorably to its more common Ryzen 7 equivalent, I believe the 780M, and it's a very good APU for handhelds overall due Lunar Lake's power efficiency compared to other X86 chips.  You have to understand that for these next two generations Intel seems to be making big strides in terms of both power efficiency and integrated graphics for mobile, it's a very attractive option and the first time I've seriously considered a laptop without a dGPU. I think Panther Lake is going to be a very nice kit next year for both laptops and handhelds and give AMD a run for its money.   I suspect AMD genuinely needs a new APU graphics architecture implemented next year to keep up, which I expect them to. Not a bad problem to have.",Positive
Intel,"Yeah for sure. It's a small die and should be yielding pretty high. See also the number of 4+8+4 SKUs. Looks like the larger CPU tile is also yielding decently, so not a ton to cut down.

I expect the big CPU tile and small GPU tile pairing will find its way into a number of gaming laptops as the iGPU performance is pretty low on the priority list for those.",Neutral
Intel,"PTL's main changes are fixing MTL/ARL's terrible SoC design, which should net a few % performance. It'll see a mild IPC increase, getting a few more % performance. And it'll lose a bit of clockspeed, erasing most of those gains.  Expect PTL to be very similar performance to ARL, but with lower power consumption, a much better iGPU, and most importantly to Intel: Using their own fabs instead of TSMC.  It absolutely won't be X3D in gaming.  Edit: Actually shocked that people think this would compete with X3D.  9955HX3D is \~16% faster than a 275HX in gaming...and a 275HX itself is easily 10%+ faster than a 285H in gaming.  Not even Intel themselves are claiming this. Their own marketing refers to PTL as ""ARL performance with LNL efficiency"". Nobody realistically expects PTL-H to see a 25%+ gaming improvement over ARL-H. The fact that IPC increase is less than 10% and clockspeed is slightly lower than ARL-H should make this obvious",Neutral
Intel,CGC is a LNC tick. This is well known at this point. And we see it's even a clock speed regression.    Even entertaining the notion it will close the gap to AMD's X3D chips is just delusional.,Neutral

Just personally think some sacrifices are worthwhile if it can condense Intel's mobile lineup back down to something sane again.   > I expect the big CPU tile and small GPU tile pairing will find its way into a number of gaming laptops as the iGPU performance is pretty low on the priority list for those.

Intel,"Given how well ARL HX was received in gaming laptops, I think they may wait to have something from NVL take that top spot. 5.1ghz does seem low though. ARL-H will happily do 5.4 and 18A should clock decently, though I suppose that's a sacrifice for the 25W TDP.  I suspect these may not be totally final clocks though they do seem reasonable.",Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, surprised ARL-HX is doing as ok as it is. The deficits of the architecture in gaming are well known. If it could hit the same clocks and core counts, PTL should look a lot better still. And all that besides, ARL's cost structure is horrible. For Intel's own sake, the sooner they move on, the better.   > and 18A should clock decently, though I suppose that's a sacrifice for the 25W TDP  From the same leaker, these chips are at 65W or even 80W TDPs, so they're not merely power limited. It seems that 18A just significantly underperform some expectations, though in line with some rumors and the gist of the revisions Intel's been making to its projections over the last year or two.  > I suspect these may not be totally final clocks though  If they're defining SKUs and such, these clocks need to be finalized for all practical purposes.",Negative
Intel,"If I'm reading correctly those are max power limits, not the TDP,  though I get what you mean. The 285H sits at a 45W TDP and tops out at 115W. Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  As for why ARL HX is doing well in gaming laptops, I think a good bit of that is also part of what made it lackluster on desktop. It doesn't really scale up that well with higher TDPs and power limits, but it does seem to scale down. The 285HX with its 55W TDP and 160W max limit doesn't perform far off the 125W TDP and 250W max of the 285K.  It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system. The 9955HX3D is very impressive, but quite a lot of laptop buyers seem to value the ability to do more laptop-like things with their gaming laptops than the extra frame rate. I'm hoping this gets shaken up as AMD adopts new packaging tech as seen in Strix Halo.",Neutral

Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  Not guaranteed given it's just a twitter leak, but I'm assuming the leaker is using the term TDP consistently with Intel's historical usage, i.e. PL1. For ARL, 115W is PL2. I would also assume there wouldn't be the disclaimer about it being hard to cool if they cut the PL2 so much, though PowerVia does create some interesting complications there, so maybe not quite apples to apples.  Either way though, don't think it should have much impact on ST boost. You're talking a good 70%-ish of power going to compute, so even at 65W PL2, that's still 40-50W available for one core. Should be *easily* sufficient to hit whatever the silicon is capable of.  > It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system.  Yes, and this is something I've very much looking forward to with NVL-HX. At this point, the biggest demerit of the -HX platform vs -H is the use of standard DDR5 vs LPDDR. That's because it's still based on the desktop silicon with the different SoC/hub tile. But with NVL using a shared SoC die, they should be able to offer an -HX platform with the core counts people expect (though probably limited to single die 8+16), but the power/battery life advantages of -U/-P/-H. In general, should help make the -HX more of a straight-up upgrade than the tradeoffs one faces today.  AMD has this situation even worse today, because there's a much bigger gap between their desktop SoC architecture and the mobile one.

Intel,Should be here in a few days and I’ll tear it down and prep it. I’ll see how it goes when it’s down to -70c and do some scores and then shunt it. I think it can probably handle 30% more wattage just fine. My HWBOT is Forsaken7. I’ll let you know.,Positive
Intel,So do you have outlets in Australia where you can buy Maxsun Gpus?  Does Maxsun have an outlet in Australia where you can RMA to?  I am in the US and I want to look into getting the dual Arc card with 48gb of vram.,Neutral
Intel,"Okay, household freezers get to -18C. Water freezes at 0C, antifreeze freezes at about -25C. So, car coolant in a freezer will get to and hold -18C while staying liquid. So, that's how I did it.",Neutral
Intel,"Just be aware (from my experience anyway) when Intel crashes it doesn't just crash the driver, it crashes into a full reboot, almost every time. It's a real effing pain in the arse.",Negative

Intel,"This isn't a ""halo"" product. An upgrade to Arrow Lake/Lunar Lake when it comes to iGPU, but not Strix Halo. It won't cost as much as well.",Negative
Intel,look forward to new APUs,Neutral
Intel,Wait for Nova Lake AX. It will have 48 GPU cores instead of 4/8/12.,Neutral
Intel,Likely will be worse since it has only 1/3 the power usage and significantly smaller chip size.,Negative
Intel,"It's meant to confuse you in purpose, so you ignore it and go by the 3/5/7/9 scheme. Marketing success is dependent on the company leading the customers to the way they want it. So it needs to be complex and confusing.",Negative

Intel,"'Strix Halo' is lees about being a halo product, because it’s just an AMD internal naming scheme for the set of specific APU products. APUs that will follow 'Strix Halo' will be called 'Gorgon Point'. Since 'Strix Halo' is already out and the Panther Lake in question is about to come out it might be better to compared it to the next AMD 'Gorgon Point' APU line? But I still think it can be compared to 'Strix Halo'. At least I’m looking forward to see the comparison.  Edit: changed 'Strix Point' into 'Gorgon Point' since that’s what I meant.",Neutral
Intel,You’ll be waiting till 2027 on the amd side.,Neutral
Intel,All halo iGPUs are way too overpriced. Even regular iGPUs are overpriced going into $1K laptops.   And if you want to spend that money you can do it today with Strix Halo.,Negative
Intel,"Lesser power usage doesn’t always equals to performance losses.  See the Apple Axx SOCs and the Qualcomm snapdragon SOCs.  Even with the x86-CPUs over time they had more performance gains while maintaining almost the same power consumption.  Not anymore, but they could catch up with better chip design?",Neutral

Intel,Really? This should be good for Intel in 2026.,Positive
Intel,These Halo iGPUs are meant for LLM first and foremost. If you just want to game just get a normal RTX laptop.,Neutral
Intel,They are like 20% more efficient.  You are talking about 200% more efficient if it hits the same performance.    They might as well make it a mobile chip if that is how good it is. Would be great on phones.  Would be better than most pcs right now on 5W envolope.,Positive
Intel,"It's intentional, and non specific. So most go by the 3/5/7/9 naming. In order for them to have max profit, they need to lead you to the chips they want you to buy.",Neutral

Intel,"Yes, Strix Point lives *alongside* Strix Halo. Strix Point is already out, and came out *before* Strix Halo at that. It is not the followup to Strix Halo.",Neutral
Intel,You are right. I meant 'Gorgon Point'.,Neutral
Intel,"Gorgon point is just a refresh of strix point. These terms mean less in the next gen anyway as the follow on products have quite different names. Medusa point isn't really the successor to gorgon point, for example.",Neutral

Intel,"We finally got reviews for the B50 and it is a SFF gem! That said… I wish Intel would get better at promoting upcoming products, they seem to be slowed down by the restructuring.  I’m going with the flow, whatever will be will be. I’m waiting for Dividends to kick back in so I can retire with Intel.",Positive
Intel,"Boy, I am glad they picked an easy naming convention.   /s  After Xe, Xe1, Xe2 no doubt next would be Xe3, then Xe3p  After A-series, B-series, no doubt next would be C-series.    Too bad those generations do not line up",Positive
Intel,Intel is not serious with dGPUs,Neutral
Intel,"If it was coming, you expect them to talk about the future even a little bit. Instead, nothing.    They cancelled Celestial over a year ago now. Sounds like things haven't improved since.",Negative

Intel,"Yes, they are literally just playing. It's all a game lol",Neutral
Intel,"They have released about the same number recently as AMD, I'd say they're pretty serious. The B50 is a pretty compelling product too, big features for the price.",Negative

Intel,"They cancelled Celestial over a year ago now. Sounds like things haven't improved since.   MLID people showing themselves.  Tom Peterson previously said Celestial discrete hardware was already done and they were working on Druid. So if they cancelled it, it must have really sucked.

Intel,Where did you hear that it was cancelled?,Neutral
Intel,"We are supposed to get B60s also but they will likely be very limited and part of Battlematrix.

Intel,There has been no update regarding celestial dGPUs internally.,Negative
Intel,AMD is skipping a generation to focus on the next. Intel has lost its focus on GPUs. These are not the same things.,Neutral
Intel,Lol no. ARC was 0 margin product. Now it's fate depends on the whims of VPs not engineers.,Negative

Intel,"> MLID people showing themselves.  I'm not getting this from MLID.  > Tom Peterson previously said Celestial discrete hardware was already done  No, that's absolutely false. Actually watch the interview instead of reading reddit comments. He said Xe3 (specifically in PTL), not Celestial, was done.

And as we now know, they don't consider that even in the same family as what would be Celestial.",Negative
Intel,Ex-Intel coworkers/acquaintances.,Neutral
Intel,>There has been no update regarding celestial dGPUs internally.  Do you have internal information?,Negative
Intel,Why would they? Battlemage is not even finished. Battlemage is not even 1 year old yet. They will still release B7XX gpus and probably B3XX.  I expect them to tallk about celestial by next year.,Negative
Intel,> Intel has lost its focus on GPUs  So despite them repeatedly telling you they have not... they have?,Neutral
Intel,"Battle mage is not a 0 margin product...  I know how much silicon cost etc due to my job. Believe me there is at least %30 gross margin in Battlemage and that is assuming somehow Intel got a worse price compared to my small ass company.     It's not profitable due to amount of R&D it takes to develop it, Intel earns a significant chunk for each Battlemage sold. They are simply not as greedy as Nvidia and AMD to earn market share.",Negative
Intel,Dude XE3 even has some test shipment reports etc. It's too late to cancel.   Sure if it's not good maybe we will only see B580 replacement.    But it's literally impossible and stupid to cancel it right now. Especially given how much gross profit they made from B580,Negative

Well yes, if they cancel a project, and I know they have, I'll say they cancelled it. The way Intel can convince me to say otherwise is by... not cancelling projects. And you *do* realize they haven't talked about client dGPUs past BMG in many, many months, right? It's not like Intel's really denying anything.  I'm not sure what you're looking for here. Should I lie and pretend not to know what I do? To what end? It's not like Intel's harmed by me saying they cancelled such a project. That's not something you can keep a secret indefinitely, and anyone who *really* cares already knows.  > Also just look at job listings, there is many for gpu development.  If you lay off 10 people, 5 more leave on their own, and then you backfill 4, that's still a net loss. They still need some people, but not as many as they had, and not for client dGPU.",Negative
Intel,"Intel have not claimed there to be upcoming Celestial, or more Battlemage or anything like it. How did their silence convince you of anything?",Negative
Intel,Actually after the Nvidia deal there's definite reason for Intel to cancel future ARC development.  They have a partner that makes better GPU than them. Why would they continue? If the Nvidia deal is successful I expect even their iGPU will disappear.  In no sense it makes sense to develop a line that's redundant with what your partner is doing.,Negative
Intel,"> Which means it is being used, produced, and cannot be disqualified yet   Again, Xe3p lives for various things. Celestial, the client dGPU planned to be based on that IP, is dead. I'm not sure what contradiction you think exists here.    > nor does anything, not one trustworthy source, show it is cancelled   Intel's refusal to talk about future gen client dGPUs and the mass layoffs in the hardware team don't tell you anything? Or what about Gelsinger's remarks about less focus on dGPU?    This is how Intel usually handles cancellations btw. They simply pretend it never existed, unless investors really demand to know. Even then they like to delay the acknowledgement.",Negative
Intel,Think pretty easy naming. Any X infront just automatically means better iGPU,Positive
Intel,"Looks pretty snappy at \~75% faster than the top-end LNL chipset and this is with pre-release drivers.  Granted TDP is probably higher.  If they get the drivers cleaned up then it might release a bit higher which makes it a viable (though still materially weaker) thin and light XX50 dGPU model alternative some some of the market.  Should do well addressing the 'I want a thin and light laptop, but I want it to have an ok GPU' crowd.",Neutral
Intel,"Panther Lake 12 Xe3 performance looks great to match RTX 3050 laptop performance because the entire chip only draw half power of RTX 3050. Seems like using 18A BPD really paid of to reduce CPU consumption by a lot with the helps of Tsmc N3E for iGPU.    Also it's so weird to see Asus Zephyrus G14 with Intel chip, usually it always has Amd CPU paired with Nvidia GPU. I heard G14 is pretty popular gaming laptop but this laptop during full load can use 120w+ power.    Using Panther Lake 12 Xe3 will makes this laptop looks even more appealing because it reduces power requirements from 120w+ to 45w but still giving about the same GPU performance which is insane.

The average user understands the difference between, say, a Core Ultra 5 and 7, because the ideal of 3, 5, 7, 9 being product tiers exist in plenty of industries, like BMW's product line.

Intel,Intel wasn't a static target since the 10th gen. They've been pushing (at least in terms of performance) since then. It's mostly the efficiency which stepped back. And they messed up their current lineup in terms of performance and pricing but they've improved for sure.  Next gen seems good for them though. Hope they price it well. AMD isn't zen 1/2 either. They're bumping core numbers too and introducing some new cores as well.,Neutral
Intel,"I mean, why?  Is AMD going to be coming out with anything more powerful than the HX 370 in that power range?",Neutral
Intel,because 50% more cores need 50% more power for 50% more performance.,Neutral
Intel,"There are so many variables here that we have no way of accurately saying that.  It's possible that Xe3 is simply treated more like RDNA in this benchmark, and that the Xe2 140V is unfairly biased towards in that way. If that is the case, the 890M and 8060S may be better metrics to base off, and we do see over 50% gains for a 50% wider GPU than the 890M.  It's also possible this is a power-limited scenario. Like for like on TDP, this would be a solid improvement given the GPU both has to be moved off-tile compared to Lunar Lake, and has twice as many CPU cores to fight for power.  This could be pre-release drivers not getting the true 100% out of the hardware or silicon with non-final clocks still being tuned. The point is there's no way to know for sure.",Neutral
Intel,I don’t understand why you people continue to use that MSI claw to demonstrate “intel improved lunar lake performance post launch” when there are millions of lunar lake laptops that never had performance issue of that one handheld.,Negative
Intel,"they're keeping their jobs because this is technically better than the past. back in the day you'd have model numbers exclusive to a retail store, much less specific to an OEM, because businesses wanted to feel like they got a bespoke deal.   These days the SKU naming is mostly for accounting purposes, while the ""real"" naming decisions are made by the OEMs. basically most people are buying the Thinkpad/Yoga/ROG ""brand"" rather than the specific processor model, which only a much smaller crowd bothers to comprehend. It's like how people buy the Steamdeck rather than whatever APU is in there, which is fairly old at this point.",Neutral

Intel,The lunar lake laptops are tested by reviewers all the same as the strix point ones.

Intel,"e cores are surprisingly powerful now, and games are getting more multithreaded. It might be better to spread them out over 8 less power hungry cores than 4 P cores and then spill over to the slower cores. Especially in a laptop environment where efficiency matters and the GPU is usually holding back gaming performance so much that CPU performance is really not that important.  In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread. But most importantly, it doesn't do so evenly. Maybe you don't need something assigned to e cores, or the e core task is light and doesn't hold up the other threads. Then things will run at the pace of the P cores, but every now and then you'll have a slowdown.",Neutral
Intel,Wonder if there's some energy star requirements.,Neutral
Intel,"Shouldn't be. That's what the math has always said.  As soon as software can scale to ""many"" cores, the tradeoffs that go into single powerful P style cores are a bad deal. Both frequency and sequential optimizations (like multi-level branch prediction) scale poorly.  Gaming benchmarks tend to have a really strong feedback loop that favors last gen hardware design though. So seeing the benefits to E cores for gaming requires 1.) e-cores exist for a while 2.) some games optimize for them.  Long term, an optimal Intel-style processor design will look something like 4 ""legacy"" P cores + dozens of E cores.",Negative

Intel,"Really should focus on the Main/Sub thread part. Most games will usually only load up 1-3 cores, with the rest of the cores only used for incidental workloads with lower priority and sync requirements (Multithreading is hard yo, Multithreading with latency requirements is mindnumbing).  This makes plenty of games very suitable for the P/E architecture, as long as you have enough P cores for the Main threads, the E cores will be perfectly sufficient.",Neutral

Intel,">Starfield  [Not really](https://youtu.be/BcYixjMMHFk?t=1015), game doesn't benefit from more cores/threads.  >Bannerlord  Sadly, there's no benchmarks of different CPUs that I could find for this specific game, but I do know that this game heavily relies on a good CPU, but without decent data(review), which shows multiple CPUs tested, it's hard to understand the benefits of more cores/threads,  >UE5 games due to how the rendering pipeline works  It's true that UE5 can utilize 8 cores / 16 threads, but more than that? I'm not sure, if possible, provide a review/video which shows that UE5 scale with more cores/threads, so far, it seems that it is limited at 8c/16t - big channels rarely add UE5 games to their CPU benchmarks, but I found Remnant 2,[ and it doesn't show any benefits](https://youtu.be/3n537Z7pJug?t=1056) of more than 8 cores.  I heard that ""games are getting more multithreaded"" like 4-5 years ago, and in most cases, it wasn't true, with more than 8c/16t almost no games scale on CPU-side, and even when they do, in most cases it's a minor improvement over 8c/16t configuration, like 1-3%.",Negative
Intel,"UE5 by default does not support multithreading well. actually I don't think async shader is even considered a default feature yet despite being added two years ago. Only the editor compilation step uses all threads, but it doesn't need to react to user input so it would be more surprising if it didn't use all threads.

Intel,"12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark, like actually within error margins next to 7800X3D despite being an older platform with half the L2 of raptor lake and lower clock speed than even 7700X, shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much. Yeah 9950X should outperform it technically I guess but the split L3 between two CCDs probably holds back the advantage of having more cores.  Yeah sadly there's no benchmark for Bannerlord. But supposedly it does disperse its tasks to plenty of threads.   Here's some benchmarks showing core and thread usage in a few games. While the benchmark tool doesn't get into the details of how those software behave obviously, but at least according to the graphs some games like Tarkov really suck at distributing its tasks to several cores but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.

Intel,">12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark  It's because Creation Engine 2 worked better with Intel hardware until AM5 X3D chips, and 12900K great result in this test just shows that it's still a good CPU with 8 Performance cores, not that it's core count matters in any significant way - for example, 7700X delivers identical performance with lower core count/threads.  >lower clock speed than even 7700X  Clock speeds can't be compared between different architectures, different architecture = different efficiency, what matters is IPC.  >shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much  [here's a better example where more intel CPUs are present in Starfield test](https://youtu.be/XXLY8kEdR1c?t=29m5s), as you can see, increased core count/threads past 8 performance cores and 16 thread's is meaningless and won't provide any noticeable performance improvements, 6 faster P-cores on Intel 14600K provided better result than slower 8 P-cores on 12900K.   Going from 7950X to to 7700X results in 5 FPS loss, which is like 2-3% less FPS, and it's mostly because of lower clock speed(5.7Ghz Vs 5.4Ghz boost).   >but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.  That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.  Edit: typo",Positive
Intel,"Well you said that games are optimized for 8/16 and yet gn bench shows 7600X only gets 3-4 less avg fps than 7700X in baldurs gate 3, a highly multithreaded game, it has better 0.1% lows even, though I'm sure that one is a contained incident since BG3 is very dynamic and hence results are not always repeatable. Same with Starfield.   That's because in video games, core count matters less than how fast the CPU can access or manipulate very dynamic types of data in a random memory address.    X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"". They're going to win in old or new games, and they're winning in games because they have a large buffer of low latency data. Not winning in productivity benchmarks because productivity is about processing matters more than accessing data, and its more easily multithreaded too in many cases.    But having more cores is still more advantageous in software and games that can occupy them.",Neutral

Point of discussion was to prove that games are using more than 16 threads or they're not - it seems like you overestimated Starfield, UE5 reliance on core count/threads and most games care about 16 threads at most.   >core count matters less  Yes, that's why I replied to that person and asked him to provide me with modern AAA games which are more ""multi-threaded"" now than AAA games a few years ago, I feel like what he ""observes"" is what he wants to believe, and not something that actually happened with optimization in games.  >X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"".  AMD sells 9950X3D, best productivity and gaming CPU, if you really need both(workloads/gaming) it's the optimal way, for an average user, only benefit of E-cores is lower power draw when idle - but they do matter more if you need those workloads, I agree, but we discussed gaming performance and core reliance.",Neutral

Intel,"For them to do a 'big iGPU' design they would need to do a few things:  1. Use a different socket.  The iGPU will get too big for the existing one.  2. Upgrade the memory bus to 256bit.

Add cache to the chip for the iGPU to use (to make up for the poor bandwidth they get from LPDDR5, even with a wider bus)  If they don't do this then the chip (which again won't fit in their default socket) will be massively bandwidth constrained to the degree that it's pointless.  Basically, do all the stuff that Strix Halo did.  Issue is Strix Halo didn't sell very well, the idea is a proof of concept and the concept needs faster memory to really work well.  LPDDR6 might help a lot at getting these big chip ideas from a XX60 level to a XX70 level, but they still require a lot of expensive chip work and a new motherboard design custom to the big socket.

AMD,"I saw it, he doesn't even mention the graphs being misleading from the slidedeck (it's clear from the video he has access to the slides), but GN does look at latency results. In the end, I wish he was harsh like he was with NVIDIA because honestly, AMD is just copying NVIDIA's homework and using the same BS playbook, pretending Frame Gen is increasing frame rate and [making the game's performance ""faster""](https://cdn.videocardz.com/1/2025/12/AMD-FSR-REDSTONE-VC-5_videocardz.jpg) (their words not mine).",Neutral
AMD,It's still presenting the FPS increases without any context for how compromised the experience is compared to regular frames. But I agree that using it as a tool to lie about performance uplift of a new product compared to the old one is considerably more dishonest.,Neutral
AMD,"Bro lmao, every time I see you defending AMD like their white knight. Redstone is clearly DLSS 1.0 and AMD rushed to release it because they're getting stomped in software features.

AMD,"There is a leaked INT8 path for FSR4 that works on older hardware and has been implemented by others (i.e., on Linux in Proton-GE).  It works pretty good already, which makes AMD's reticence to put it out officially *baffling* -- especially since they aren't putting RDNA4 into APUs for a while yet, and want to sell a bunch of those in gaming-focused handhelds and Steam Machines.  AMD has a good software product here for once and they need a broad installed base to drive developer adoption, but they don't seem to care and it's infuriating.",Positive

AMD,"4x frame gen is really niche, there are so few cases where it actually makes sense and doesn't cause an unacceptable amount of artifacting and/or latency.

AMD,"4x FG is a gimmick at this point. Maybe FG progresses to the point that it's viable in the future, but it really isn't right now.",Neutral
AMD,The only benefit I can think of is maybe better motion clarity by pushing the FPS to 200+ or something if you have a really good monitor (i.e. an OLED). But even then the hit on latency means it would only work well for games where latency is not hugely important.,Neutral
AMD,"If I recall, the main harshness on Nvidia was the way they were trying to push reviewers to only review performance with frame generation enabled, an inherently dishonest take.  To be fair, I also haven't seen the video on this yet either, but I think ""frame gen generally sucks in these ways"" is pretty well established and those factors are unlikely to change drastically",Negative

But, who knows if Windows is locking it down for CoPilot, or if it is accessible in the same way as the one in the GPU (since it is technically part of the CPU).  I bet they will figure it out though.  With Intel about to release their own competitor to it (maybe... no GPU benchmarks yet), they will want to use all they have to combat it.",Neutral

Intel's business practices and strategic decisions have been extreme short-term profit motivated since.. even before 2010?

It's been a slow motion train wreck, competitors with much more growth R&D momentum catapulting past them, leaving them in the dust.  It's kind of like a desire for justice? Cheering on an org reaping what they sow? Of course, in America companies like Intel, or certain industries, like in 2008, get bailed out anyway. No justice; moral hazards aplenty.",Neutral

Lunar Lake is pretty good (it's efficient, though ARM solutions still beat it in performance per watt) and Panther Lake is sounding better (ARM still wins, but it's a good gap over AMD and most people ex-Apple want x86).  That's a different market than desktop though.

AMD,"prices going up above msrp 18 months after release isn't ""normal""",Neutral
AMD,"This is just factually wrong. Look at GPU price history from MSRP to market price for the last year. GPU launches were incredibly inflated until these last 2 months, so what you think is ""black friday deals"" and ""cheap"" is what was supposed to be its original MSRP lol. Now this price hike is just to artificially raise the price to maintain the same profit margins they've had from the past year out of pure greed. No reason for AMD to raise prices on existing products on shelfs except for pure greed. No reason for RAM manufacturers to not offer long term contracts to large customers and OEMs when they are purposely causing a shortage, except for pure greed. No reason for Nvidia (who does not produce a large quantity of their FE GPUs themselves and relies on AIBs) to not bundle Vram with their dyes to the AIBs that have a smaller profit margin than Nvidia, except for pure greed.  20% of this is speculation of a AI bubble pop, the other 80% is companies seeing blood in the water and hopping on the price gouging train to artificially raise the prices for the whole industry. When all the businesses collude and work together to raise the price of computing power, which is now an essential commodity now that it powers the world, who stops them? I can't see it being government as they are apart of the majority of the demand for these AI datacenters.

AMD,"Counterpoint: Competition only works if there’s checks and balances to prevent price collusion. The stupid SSD mafia colluding and keeping prices high (DAE remember the great fire sale of SSDs in late 2023?). There’s no reason why a 2TB 990 Pro should be that close in price to a 9100 Pro. Were they losing money then? I am hard pressed to believe they were.  The skeptic in me however is willing to bet the RAM prices are never going to go down, and this will become the new normal, and they’ll just pocket the difference (unless there’s something major that happens like upstart Chinese suppliers flooding the DRAM market forcing them to).",Negative

One thing I noticed in the past from my years of PC experience is that your system will generally use less RAM if its going to be approaching the limit. This suggests that theres algorithms that will use disk space instead and/or do memory reallocations. There is a performance cost to this.  That said I think 32GB is a good amount of RAM, I rarely approach it.  However you never know what apps or games are leaking memory so having a lot is nice.",Neutral

AMD,"Platform longevity has to have some kind of financial value placed on it.   The maximum value of long platform longevity is the price of a motherboard. And you maximize this value if you buy into the very first generation on that platform. So every subsequent generation you enter in, the value of platform longevity goes down.   You also have to consider what impact generational improvements have on platform longevity. Zen 1 -> Zen 3 was a huge jump. Assuming Zen 7 on AM5, I don't think we're gonna see that level of improvement with Zen 4 -> Zen 7.  Let's say someone upgrades from AM4 to AM5 with the launch of Zen 6. They receive less value from platform longevity than someone who entered at Zen 4. And someone who bought in at Zen 4 will likely receive less value than someone who bought in at Zen 1.  So yes, platform longevity does have value. It's better to have platform longevity than to not have it.

AMD,"Maybe for an experienced builder, but to me (someone who's only built 1 PC) the prospect of just changing the CPU seems like a far less daunting task.  If you just want to replace the CPU, you unscrew 4 screws to remove your cooler/AIO pump head, pop open the socket, put your new CPU in, repaste and remount the cooler, plug some fans back in if necessary, and you're good. Maybe remove the GPU if you're really pressed for space.  When changing an entire motherboard, you have to unmount the cooler, remove the GPU, unplug every cable plugged into the motherboard, possibly remove some AIO fans/the radiator (or just fans in general) from the case if they're getting in the way of the motherboard screws, remove the motherboard, and remove any SSDs you want to reuse.   Then you have to put everything (CPU, SSDs, RAM) on the new motherboard, put the new motherboard in, repaste and remount the cooler, remount any fans you had to take off and plug them back into the motherboard, plug all your PSU cables again, then put your GPU back into place.  You basically have to redo a big chunk of the entire build process. Not to invalidate what you said, maybe you are proficient enough that all that would only take you 10 additional minutes. But I would not bank on the average DIY PC owner being able to do all that so quickly.",Neutral

AMD,"Any explanation for why the 7800XT beats the 7900 GRE at 1080P low/medium?  Is it that the greater amount of MCD:s in the 7900 GRE vs 7800 XT puts more pressure on the CPU, which results in a bottleneck on the 7900 GRE? Or is it just more MCDs = more latency = worse performance with high FPS due to latency?",Neutral

AMD,"Since you've not had it long, let me pass on some unsolicited advice:  Leave the undervolt off when not gaming. You won't eat up any extra wattage or anything, but it will ensure that you don't run into any issues with stability at low power states. Not that you're guaranteed to have issues, just that it sure makes things easier to diagnose when you KNOW it's not your ""OC."" Adrenaline makes it so easy that you might as well.   Additionally, when starting a new game and facing crashing, the absolute first thing you should do is cut your undervolt in half. It's astounding how much variation in stability you'll face with undervolts and different games.   For example, my 9070 XT is stable at -70mv in any synthetic benchmarks I can throw at it. But it wasn't 100% stable in Horizon Forbidden West until I dropped it down to -65mv. Then in Tiny Tina's Wonderlands I had to drop it down to -45mv to avoid the occasional crash.   But if I load up Horizon again, -65mv for 10 hours straight no problem.   Play around and figure it out. It's fun.",Neutral

I know someone who snagged a 6800 brand new for $330 more than a year into the RDNA3 era. Also, supplies didn't dry up for a **long** time in many/most markets. It was basically a no-brainer.

Their entire consumer gaming graphics division is already being run at a massive opportunity cost to their real money maker, datacenter GPUs. It's frankly a miracle that they haven't decided to entirely scrap it yet when the same dies they're selling to consumers for a few grand at most can be sold to AI datacenters for tens of thousands.",Neutral
AMD,"\> absorb the costs if they desire  What makes you think they desire? They have a massive fraction of the market, and from a profit/investor POV raising prices is win/win here unless it somehow risks significant market share loss.",Neutral
AMD,"Agreed.  I’m just sort of surprised they would absorb the cost at all, tbh.",Neutral
AMD,>Nvidia has much better margins on gaming GPUs so they can absolutely absorb the costs if they desire.  Which won't happen. Nvidia doesn't want to be a charity.,Neutral
AMD,"True, and I recommend people get cards based on their needs/desires, never blanket recommend 1 company over the other.  I’m just surprised it’s AMD who might raise prices before Nvidia, even if they can absorb some of the cost.",Negative
AMD,That's only a rumor and has not been confirmed.,Neutral
AMD,"Why are AMD's margins slimmer?  They're manufacturing at the same place using very similar technology. Their equivalent product is actually a little smaller than Nvidia's in terms of die size... they're a big TSMC customer, while obviously not as big as Nvidia they're not some small timer who can't negotiate a favourable deal either.  On this basis I would assume AMD and Nvidia have very similar margins on GPU sales to board partners.",Neutral
AMD,then why are AMD cards more expensive?,Negative
AMD,Still seeing $579.,Neutral
AMD,"When you've been there for 20 years and kept losing market share in the last decade continuously, you are in deep problem. But for AMD, right now they prefer being the SOC for gaming and have little interest in putting effort in dGPUs.",Negative
AMD,"I doubt Nvidia will raise prices they will most likely just stop producing FE""s. Which isn't the same as eating the cost or raising it.   Then AIB's will most likely raise pricing. That isn't due to Nvidia thats AIB's doing what they gotta do.   As far as priority gaming has never been the priority for Nvidia this generation. There priority is AI chips. Everything else is secondary to that.   AMD CPU division is basically printing money now. They want there GPU division to go anywhere. There going to need to be more competitive, right now there not.   They don't offer a better software stack, Ray tracing or anything to match the 5080 in performance. They also have a reputation of dropping support a LOT sooner then Nvidia  That means they need to become a value leader and why in the world would you pay the same or more for a 9700xt over a 5070 Ti?   Specially if the two are with in 50 dollars of each other or even 100 dollars of each other.",Neutral
AMD,"Whelp if that rumors become the truth, then it is definitely right to expect the Nvidia GPUs will also get a price increase, i just wonder when it will happen and why AMD did it first with their RDNA 4...",Neutral
AMD,"Usually it's best not to buy during the post-launch rush when prices are way inflated, unless one can get one of the few actual MSRP offers.  Other than that, I totally agree that trying to predict the future is largely futile. Especially now that generational improvements have become so slow and low. Hardware holds its value for longer than ever before and the risk of buying a product only to see it depreciate it soon after is therefore also low.  People who bought any decently reviewed GPU at MSRP since the RTX 20-series have gotten pretty good value by now.",Negative
AMD,"9070 xt shouldn't be too bad either, considering it can be had for less than $/€600. Unless you're a big fan of AI upscaling.  Waiting for delivery now, I guess the shop has a bit of backlog after BF/CM.",Negative
AMD,Either way the days of the affordable 200-300$ value king are long gone.  Anomalies like the Nvidia 8800GT or the 1080 Ti will never happen ever again.,Negative
AMD,>95% will never use it  And the other 5% could use 4 or 100? Or is the XTX too cheap for that?,Negative
AMD,"Sure, but how often can you predict something will drop that much? When the 5090 was announced didn't people sell their 4090s for as much as they bought them or slightly more? Also, if I'm going to use a GPU for 3 months, I'm not going to wait for it to drop in price.",Neutral
AMD,"I like to buy every other year now, while my current GPU still holds some value.   GTX 970 -> 980 Ti -> 1080 -> RTX 2070 Super -> 3080 -> RX 9070 XT",Positive
AMD,Brand new in the EU I’ve seen them go brand new for as little as €609 actually. He had it listed for €540 but I managed to haggle it down to €500. So roughly €100-€110 off MSRP?,Neutral
AMD,and proper setups cost quite a bit too.,Neutral
AMD,"Also means there's probably going to be a lot more variability in performance from vendor to vendor than we're used to, due to the sourcing of VRAM potentially being from different places.",Neutral
AMD,They have 92% of the gaming sector. It's easy money and a failsafe if the AI bubble goes bust.,Neutral
AMD,Nvidia is also likely in a position where can get better prices on memory than AMD. So they might not be facing reduced margins yet.,Neutral
AMD,Im surprised that people even consider AMD its not priced well against Nvidia and Intel is coming hot on its heels. Their attitude towards consumers is frankly appalling considering that they are just fighting for scraps in this space,Negative
AMD,"Why is it ok to talk about AMD rumors but not NVidia ones?  The seemingly official quote in this article is clearly at least partially wrong:  It states no new products through 2027.  Do you really believe AMD won't be producing any new GPU SKUs for over 2 years?  I think in both cases these rumors are likely true, but may be a bit off given that both are sloppy third hand leaks without any confirmation from the source or quality multiple sources.",Negative
AMD,A 9070 XT's die is almost as large as a 5080 but are selling it for far less. Also nvidia is doubt able to just get a better price on components.,Neutral
AMD,"They have far lower market share, they most likely price their stuff with a lower margin. Nvidia can do whatever they want.",Neutral
AMD,"Nvidia has a 378 mm2 GPU that has a MSRP of $1000 and $750, while AMD for the same die size has $550 and $600 MSRP. In this case, nvidia makes between 50-80% more $$$ per die.  Nvidia has a 260 mm2 GPU has that a MSRP of $550, while AMD has a 200 mm2 for $300 and $350.  And so on....  A wafer of chips produced at TSMC generates nvidia much more money that AMD's one, even though the prices per wafer must be similar.",Neutral
AMD,"The 9070 XT is priced closer to an RTX 5070 right now, performs like a 5070 Ti but is much closer in terms of hardware to an RTX 5080. So while AMD does use similar manufacturing, they have to price lower than Nvidia for roughly the same hardware (similar GPU die size, 256-bit VRAM bus with 16GB of VRAM).",Neutral
AMD,RDN4 is on a more expensive and smaller node.,Neutral
AMD,"Their market share just went up, not down. But it's not where it should be, I'm just happy they have success in the DIY/enthusiast market, since that's where I am. I don't care much about the OEM or laptop markets.",Positive
AMD,Nvidia has about $50 billion more cash on hand to stretch it out and not be a first mover if they wish.,Neutral
AMD,"Apple has insanely good CPU hardware. But they have zero value, because it comes tied to a mac, so thats an automatic nonstarter for most.",Positive
AMD,"Macbook Air M4 is $750 most of the time now and there's no Windows laptop at the price that can compete on build quality, battery and experience, if you don't plan on doing any laptop gaming.",Negative
AMD,Unless the AI bubble pops and chipmakers find themselves sitting on a huge pile of chips that they can't sell.,Negative
AMD,"The usual trick is to list it as a business expense and claim the VAT back, but it wouldn't knock more than 5% off the price, else there'd be no profit for the seller.  It was either used or fallen off a truck.  Legit brand new was €589 in Germany around BF and CM.",Neutral

AMD,Google’s TPUs are already showing a lot of promise and its been used to train the best AI model currently,Positive
AMD,I switched to AMD mainly because of Nvidias shit drivers on Linux. Which is funny because I had previously switched to Nvidia because of AMDs shit drivers on Windows.,Negative
AMD,"Not everyone lives in the USA.  In my country it's priced competitively with a 150€ price difference to the 5070 Ti.  If you don't care about the RT difference and CUDA, going with AMD is a no brainer",Neutral
AMD,"The 5080 die is the same one as the 5070 ti, which is the direct competitor of the 9070xt and sells more than the 5080. Average margins will be slightly higher for Nvidia, but not by much. Especially considering AMD uses GDDR6.",Neutral
AMD,GDDR6 and GDDR7 do not have the same cost.,Neutral
AMD,"Ah, I was comparing 9070XT to 5070Ti.  They're all remarkably small dies but I guess that's progress.",Neutral
AMD,"Certainly NVidia has notably higher margins here, but you're likely over estimating it somewhat.  GDDR6 and GDDR7 do not have the same cost.   The overall board cost is also influenced by cooling and complexity of the board traces / power circuitry (though, not by that much).    Additionally, Its not clear how much of the actual sale (vs MSRP) NVIdia earns vs AMD -- there are various people making profit between them and the consumer.  We also know that NVidia sells the vast majority of its gaming GPUs not directly to consumers but to OEMs for pre-builds.  We don't know if NVidia sells GPUs to those OEMs at the same price they sell to D2C retail brands.  Do the big OEM system builders (NVidia's largest customers) get bulk discounts others do not?",Neutral
AMD,Oh they're about £100 or more different in price where I am.,Neutral
AMD,Yearly it went down.,Neutral
AMD,"I wouldn’t put it past people doing that but there are plenty of used 9070 XT’s in Europe selling for under €550 on some sites, just seen one sell for €530 a few hours ago and another for €550. Not uncommon.",Neutral
AMD,outside of US AMD is way too expensive to even consider for a GPU.,Negative
AMD,I dont also live in the USA. 150 pricce difference with no guarantee when they will cut first day game driver updates. Please id rather spend that extra 150 and get better support lol.,Negative
AMD,">GDDR6 and GDDR7 do not have the same cost. The overall board cost is also influenced by cooling and complexity of the board traces / power circuitry (though, not by that much).  Hope you're not trying to say that GDDR7 is responsible for the increase of $400 of board costs. Come on! A little research showed that there's just a difference of $2-3 per GB, which comes around **$30-50 for 16GB**. Please don't try to say the PCB circuitry is $300 because PCB's is one of the cheapest components of a GPU.  LE: You say the costs are influenced by cooling. FYI, the TDP increase for 5080 vs 9070 is just 45W (350W vs 304W). That's $10 **max** in cooler costs if you've been closely following the BOM cots for the industry.",Neutral
AMD,"That doesn't mean AMD isn't selling well, it can mean that Nvidia happens to sell even better. But mostly in the OEM and laptop market, not the DIY and enthusiast market that interest us.  The 9070 XT is the best selling video card on Amazon in the US and in Europe. And the best selling card on Mindfactory and various price aggregators. So it's actually looking pretty good for AMD, the 9000 series is a pretty big success.",Positive

At least for the more mainstream channels, they have been fairly consistent in praising the potential of new technologies, while criticizing sub-par implementations of said technologies which offer little to no benefit to the consumer.   For instance, DLSS 1 and FSR 1 were (rightly) criticized for being rather garbage, while the concept of temporal upsampling was at least accepted, especially once DLSS 3 proved it could be done well.   Similarly for RT, early implementations were criticized for lackluster visual improvements while tanking FPS, but I can't recall any of the big channels who seriously claimed that the underlying technology (hardware-accelerated RT) wasn't very useful.",Negative

AMD,How does this compare to the Snapdragon X2 Elite?,Neutral
AMD,"I have carefully compared the various models across Geekbench, PassMark, and the differences between Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake. If my judgment is correct, the theoretical peak performance of the 484 in Cinebench R23 should reach around **24,500**; the 285H scores **22,500**. Compared with the 285H, it should be easier for the 484 to achieve high scores because its power requirements are significantly lower than the previous generation built on TSMC N3B.  Its peak performance will not be extremely strong because the frequency is not high. IPC is likely improved by around **10–11%**, but clock speeds drop by about **6%**. Overall, that means single-core performance should only rise by **4–5%**.  The improvement will be most noticeable in Geekbench. Since PassMark single-core also shows gains, the IPC uplift and resulting single-core increase should be quite certain. If Geekbench were the only source, it would still be questionable, but PassMark is more solid and has higher reference value.  Overall, in terms of peak performance, the uplift is average—around **10%**, close to that figure.  However, the real key is the **efficiency gains**. I believe they will be excellent. Compared with the 285H, which requires **65 W** to reach **20,000** points in Cinebench R23, I estimate that the **388H** may only need **40–45 W**.  I also estimate that the Cinebench R24 score should fall around **1300–1400**. Compared with Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 at **1950**, there is still a significant gap—but the two products differ drastically in scale.  Overall, Panther Lake’s greatest achievements lie in several aspects:  1. **Energy efficiency** — likely the best among all x86 products. 2. **Performance per mm²** — excellent. For example, the 484: if you look at its die shot, the total area of the CPU (including the CPU tile’s 4P and 4 LPE cores and all caches) is essentially equal to the die area of a traditional monolithic 8-core design. That means the 484 uses the same silicon resources as past 8-core chips, yet **no AMD mobile 8-core processor surpasses it**, either in raw performance or efficiency. 3. It also offers better performance-per-area than Qualcomm’s processors. The X Elite 2 has **18 cores**, including **12 “very large” cores**—similar in size to Intel P-cores—and **6 large cores**, each larger than Intel’s E-cores. The die area of this chip is **2.5× larger** than Panther Lake 484’s.",Neutral

AMD,"Geekbench’s scaling has always been problematic, and the differences between architectures are huge. The benchmark is very friendly to ARM and least favorable to AMD.

The only valid reference is **same-generation, same-architecture comparisons**, such as between the 285H and 388H.  Based on the actual results, the improvements are about **9% in single-core** and **21% in multi-core**. Given that the 285H scores around **22,500** in Cinebench, I estimate that the 388H should be able to reach roughly **24,000**.  But the key point is **power efficiency at lower power limits**. For example, if the 285H needs around **80W** to reach 22,500, then the real question is:  * How much power does the 388H need to reach 22,500? * How many watts does it take to exceed 20,000?  This is what really matters. If the 388H can achieve 2**0,000 at 35W**, **22,500 at 60W**, and **24,000 at 80W**, then that would represent massive progress.

Meanwhile, Panther Lake uses Intel’s own **18A** process.  Based on the current benchmark results, Intel’s 18A appears to outperform TSMC’s N3B by at least the same margin that **Intel 4** trailed behind N3B — which is an astonishing result.  Every day you hear people saying how much TSMC has advanced, how far ahead its processes are, how “outdated” Intel’s nodes are, how AMD’s processors using TSMC have excellent efficiency. These kinds of statements have been repeated endlessly over the past decade.  Yet today, Intel is using its newest process node to **clearly surpass** TSMC’s top process from just one year ago.",Neutral
AMD,"Good question. I have carefully examined both sides as well. The 388H corresponds to the 484 configuration. From the die shot, the total CPU area — including all caches — is almost the same size as a traditional 8-P-core design.  Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 has two SKUs: one with 12 cores and another with 18 cores. Both have a larger die size than the 388H.  The 12-core version consists of **6 “ultra-large” cores** (Qualcomm’s terminology) plus **6 large cores**. In practice, this is equivalent to Intel having 6 P-cores plus 6 cores that are somewhere between a P-core and an E-core in size. Its die size is roughly equal to **10 Intel P-cores**.  The 18-core version has **12 ultra-large cores** plus **6 large cores**, with a die size roughly equal to **16 Intel P-cores**.  In terms of product performance, using Cinebench R24 as the standard, the 18-core X Elite 2 scores about **1960 points at 100 W**, while the 12-core version scores about **1350 points at 80 W**.  Based on the current Geekbench and PassMark results for Panther Lake, my assessment is that overall multicore performance is **10–15% higher** than the 285H. That suggests the 388H should also be able to reach **around 1350 points at 80 W**.",Neutral
AMD,"the real test will be how many watts the X9 388H needs to achieve its scores, because the 285HX needed like 90 watts to achieve its scores  so if the X9 could hit its scores while on its base TDP (65 watts) then thats a \~40% increase in efficiency, not bad",Neutral

LG OLED TVs from 2020 and before that at the very least (but likely later sets as well, I just happen to have a 2020 set) do not support VRR over DP-to-HDMI adapters and with a lack of DSC also don't support full 120 hz at 4K with 10 bit 444.",Negative
AMD,"Is it that straight forward?   From what I've read HDMI 2.1 is supported in Linux on Nvidia hardware from both the closed source and ""open source"" drivers.  The problem seems like it stems from the open source issue as even the Nvidia ""open source"" driver has closed binary blobs, which they used to support HDMI 2.1  Even from the article it suggests it seems like the hangup is also an ideological one in part -   >“At this time an open source HDMI 2.1 implementation is not possible without running afoul of the HDMI Forum requirements,” AMD engineer Alex Deucher said at the time.  This suggests they could implement HDMI 2.1 support in the same way.",Neutral

AMD,">  I wish HDMI would just fucking die already.   Keep dreaming, just like how RCA composite held off every other ""superior"" analog input for TVs until HDMI finally toppled it. Never saw anyone complaining that most TVs didn't have VGA input. Baragin-bin TVs _still_ have RCA composite input over VGA/S-Video/Component.  At this point with HDMI 2.2 supporting 96gbps, the only practical use for DisplayPort for most people is the one-cable solution for laptops to plug into a monitor dock and charge the laptop at the same time. 96gbps still isn't enough for 8K120 without DSC, so there will inevitably be something better.",Negative

AMD,> It would be nice to move away from HDMI all together.  Won't happen. RCA Composite cables dominated the scene until HDMI arrived even though there were superior analog options. HDMI cables are also very very cheap to produce. DisplayPort has a locking mechanism but that increases the cost of the cable. Same reason why RCA became mainstream over BNC.,Neutral
AMD,Your converter is likely hdmi 2.1,Neutral
AMD,"Because HDMI is deeply entrenched in the whole ecosystem and DisplayPort doesn't cover all features that are useful in that space.

AMD,"It varies from one individual card to another, but Realtek Protocol Converters were indeed used on Alchemist series models to provide (partial) HDMI 2.1 output. Depending on the specific type of color space, bit depth, refresh rate and display mode needed, [it got a bit complicated](https://community.intel.com/t5/Graphics/HDMI-2-1-UHD-144Hz-Arc-A750-A770/m-p/1452946). It's also part of why A- series cards are often a pain in the ass to get working with some TVs or older displays (the other part is poor EDID handshaking). No VESA VRR or Auto Low Latency Mode support, either.  More recent Battlemage cards, however, no longer use a PCON and support native HDMI 2.1a output, avoiding all of the above mess.  HDMI Forum does indeed still suck, regardless.",Neutral
AMD,"apple do the same, the display controllers are all DP display controllers and then if there is a HDMI port that is powered by active DP to HDMI chips on the motherboard.  Does lead to some compatibility issues that the vendor cant easily fix as the DP to HDMI converter tends to not be something they can flash new firmware onto.",Negative
AMD,"That was only for the A series and they did it because writing good drivers takes time and supporting HDMI on top of DisplayPort would make things more difficult for the driver team, which needed as much help as they could get for the launch of the first cards. The Intel B series cards have true HDMI ports and suffer the same problem as AMD on Linux with HDMI 2.1.",Negative
AMD,"And Valve should have done the same with their hardware, I assume they have enough control over the final product to do so and also to verify that it works correctly, including vrr.",Neutral
AMD,"AMD had to do the same thing. They had open source drivers ready for full HDMI 2.1 support, but they could not release them because the HDMI forum sucks.",Negative
AMD,"There's only one adapter that works reliably, the Cable Matters one. All other DP -> HDMI adapaters fail to pass through a 4K 120Hz HDR VRR 10 bit signal semi-reliably.  Other adapaters will be able to do the same specs, but not all at the same time. For instance, you'll have 4K 120Hz HDR, but VRR will not work. Or you'll have VRR but the HDR won't work. Or you'll have both, but the image will be 8 bit (HDMI 2.0 levels with 8 bit 4:2:0), causing colour issues. Or the image will straight up bug out/break/disconnect.  The Cable Matters is the only adapter the community has found which can do all the above somewhat reliably. The adapater is at its fucking limit, so sometimes it bugs out, needing to be unplugged/plugged in, or a restart; but in my experience I get 4K 120Hz HDR with VRR at 10bit most of the time. I use Bazzite on an LG C1 TV with an AMD 7900XT.  I would consider the experience absolutely usable and not a dealbreaker. It just works most of the time. I just have to unplug it and plug it back in, or restart my console PC under the TV a couple times a month.  Now we wouldn't need that adapter if the HDMI Forum allowed HDMI 2.1 on Linux without proprietary drivers (which AMD do not have). And unfortunately HDMI has a monopoly on TVs, so we're stuck with either HDMI 2.0 (which is open source on linux, but looks like shit with HDR and VRR enabled due to 8bit 4:2:0), or using a janky ass adapter to use HDMI's more reasonable competitor - Displayport.",Neutral
AMD,"No, because the underlying spec is DisplayPort, and it's converting to HDMI signaling.  It doesn't add features that DisplayPort lacks, unfortunately - DP to HDMI is generally a one-way connection, so anything coming back over HDMI will be lost.",Negative
AMD,"I'll let someone else answer that, because I've only used Arc cards on Linux servers for compute/Quicksync. I've never used the video output on them.  From what I understand about Arc (and what someone seems to have commented under me too), they do not have actual HDMI hardware, just a DP -> HDMI converter built into the card itself. This should bypass the issue entirely.",Neutral
AMD,"ARC is between your TV and your receiver (HDMI to HDMI). Assuming you're using the adapter from your PC to your TV (Displayport to HDMI), you should be fine. The video card will still send audio.",Neutral
AMD,"TVs with DP support are incredibly rare, right?",Neutral
AMD,"From reading forum posts, it's flaky. So it's a crapshoot regardless.",Neutral
AMD,"I have this adapter (CM 102101) and with my AMD 6900 XT it did not work. However with my new 5070 Ti it does (VRR really activly working, not just “on” in the driver) - while it works fine on my LG 42C2 it causes image errors every 5 seconds on my older 55C9, but in general working here too.  With the Adapter the LG 42C2 only shows ""VRR"" instead of ""Gsync"". And I activated ""Reference"" mode for colors in the new nvidia app, because HDR was a bit washed out at first.  (4K 120 HDR VRR FULL RGB) The Adapter maybe needs a firmware downgrade to .120 https://kb.cablematters.com/index.php?View=entry&EntryID=185  Some time ago they patched it out because it could cause problems.",Neutral
AMD,"The open source Nvidia driver ""works"" because it is modular. The part that the HDMI Forum refuses to open source is separate and proprietary.  Intel Arc skips the problem entirely afaik by having the DP -> HDMI converter on board the card itself. Intel Arc cards don't actually have HDMI, just a converted Displayport.  So you could use Nvidia on Linux. But then you'd have to deal with the plethora of Nvidia-specific issues on Linux: lower FPS than Windows, bad frame times, low 1% lows, bad Wayland support, no Gamescope support, etc... It's usable and mostly works if you don't look at the numbers. But when a 9070XT catches up to a 5090 in averages on Linux, and beats it in 1% lows, you know something's wrong.  About your second point, sure it's ideological in the sense that AMD decided a decade ago to make their Linux drivers open source, and part of the Linux Kernel itself. (AMD users on Linux do not update drivers, they just update the Kernel. Nvidia users have to install separate drivers like Windows). And they're paying for that (otherwise good decision) today.  But the problem in reality is practical, because it means that AMD would have to rewrite their entire driver architecture for Linux because one pesky organisation refuses to give an inch.  It's absurd to blame AMD driver design which has always been the best Linux GPU experience, when it's one organisation refusing to budge an inch and asking AMD to reinvent the wheel instead. The worst part is the HDMI 2.1 firmware isn't black magic. There's no trademark secret here that risks being exposed; let alone capabilities which Displayport doesn't already have. They're litterally just being asses about it.",Neutral
AMD,"No it's NOT that straightforward. Nvidia and AMD have very different GPU architectures. Nvidia has the GSP which offloads a lot of hardware management from the OS, including apparently HDMI-related functionality. The GSP is essentially an entire sub-OS that runs on the GPU that is launched via firmware provided by the OS. This has several benefits such as being separated from the OS so that they can have the OS-specific driver side be simpler with a shared GSP firmware. It also can help reduce load on the system CPU since many tasks are being handled directly on the GPU instead of needing to run on the CPU. And also what is probably the most important reason to Nvidia that it allows them to ""lock"" features in a way where someone can't hack the driver to unlock them (their consumer GPUs basically have all the same hardware as their enterprise ones but the consumer ones have severe limits because they want companies to buy their more expensive ones). The con of it is that it makes the GPUs slightly more expensive (pennies compared to what they get by forcing companies to buy enterprise GPUs instead) and that the firmware blobs are very large because they're essentially an entire minimal OS image.  By contrast the AMD GPUs have much simpler firmware components and delegate much of what the GSP does to the driver. This is cheaper for them but it means that they have to write the functionality multiple times for the OSs they support and they have no real mechanism to prevent people from buying their cheaper consumer GPUs instead of their more expensive ones (besides the latter having more memory and being under a support contract).",Neutral
AMD,"Not quite sure of the full details, but essentially it boils down to NVIDIA doing things differently.  They have a closed source firmware blob that handles most low level card functionality unlike AMD and Intel, and thus they can offer HDMI 2.1 functionality by not having that functionality as part of the driver itself, but rather handled by the firmware.",Neutral
AMD,"A compliant open source driver was written, submitted and rejected because it is contrary to some (Microsoft) of the funding parties interests.",Neutral

AMD,"Yeah, this is the crux of the issue  `amdgpu` is fully open-source.

Theoretically, a binary-only module could include support, but that's not a good approach either  If one were to make hardware-specific (GabeCube/SteamDeck only) support in software, it would still expose the implementation details, and would be trivial to bypass.

AMD,"It's not really about the driver itself being modular with Nvidia, but the fact that the kernel driver doesn't actually do any low level management of the card at all. Instead, the card has a processor on it (called the GSP) which manages all the functionality of the card. That's why the firmware is like 100MB; it's basically an entire driver. The OS kernel driver just tells the GSP what it wants to do and the GSP takes care of the implementation details. AMD and Intel can't do the same thing with their cards and it would require a complete rework of how the cards/GPUs are designed.

AMD,"AMD has no trouble using binary blobs elsewhere, so why not here?",Neutral
AMD,"OTOH, the refusal to compromise is on the open source projects. It's their own choice to say no to a binary module, just as it is HDMI author's choice to allow putting their IP in open-source code, or to choose to demand it being provided in binary form only.  Since the IP of HDMI is likely interconnected with copy protection technologies, if they made open saucers happy (for a moment at least, until the next outrage), they would piss off content providers.",Neutral

AMD,"No, it's probably technical. HDMI involves DRM to protect stuff like Netflix streaming content from being copied too easily.

AMD,"The issues aren't really as visible on a smaller scale. Displayport was my preferred format until I had to deal with it on a large scale.   Perhaps a quarter of the PCs at my job have displayport as their only video output. Those DP cables make up over 90% of the display cables we have to replace. When we had significant amounts of VGA / DVI those basically never died even when they got beat up badly by the users. HDMI isn't quite on that level, but they mostly only die from users smooshing their PCs against the wall and bending the hell out of the cable ends. I replace a dead HDMI cable maybe once every couple months due to this.  Our DisplayPort cables never get beat up due to the PCs associated with them being under counters in a spot where users have no reason to move them around, but despite this they die like crazy.

Perhaps the AMD driver is in fact more efficiently written than the Nvidia one or perhaps the Nvidia driver is doing something else that the AMD driver isn't.

They could always make a closed source driver of course, but this would mean essentially maintaining a completely separate driver module out of the kernel, which would mean spending resources to ensure constant compatibility.",Neutral
AMD,"Audio via HDMI supports return channels, DP doesn't. HDMI also simply has a lot more investment going into it",Neutral
AMD,"Who are they paying though? Like seriously, I've never actually thought about this and just assumed they just paid. And while they do as HDMI does have a licensing cost, where does that money actually go? All the major manufacturers are members of HDMI Forum.",Negative
AMD,"Right, but that wouldn't preclude them from having possibly included a hardware converter like Intel did on ARC. They don't have to convince the hdmi forum if they ship a hardware implementation with the GPU just outputting DP signals.  Of course, all speculation until the final hardware is out",Neutral
AMD,"Directly in the kernel vs in firmware. You cannot put binary blobs in kernel space, but you can use binary blobs on the hardware itself. That only helps if they can put all of the implementation details of HDMI2.1 into the firmware they load on the card. Maybe possible in future generations, but the current designs might not allow it to be fully handled in firmware.",Neutral
AMD,"Generally speaking, no you can't put binary modules in kernel modules even if you want to, because they effectively become GPLv2 themselves when linked into the kernel.  Nvidia does some questionable things with their binary module to try to get around this by calling out to the binary from the kernel (which I've heard referred to as a ""legal prophylactic"" lol), but even this is questionable on whether it follows the licence text. Mainly, that hasn't been tested in court, and may or may not stand up to lawyering.  Firmware is a different story, since the kernel would generally be loading the firmware into the device to make it work, rather than that code being linked against the kernel. So, a future design from AMD could place the HDMI handling in the firmware module and work fine on Linux.  Copy protection, and security through obscurity are likely factors in why the HDMI forum is so shitty about this, but I think the bigger thing is the licensing revenue. If an open implementation exists, then it could be copied into an uncertified device, and the HDMI forum would have to buy one fewer exotic car or something.  As a counterpoint, DisplayPort does HDCP (copy protection) just fine without this draconian licensing issue, and is equivalent (or better than) hdmi 2.1 in features. The only drawback to it is lack of support from TV manufacturers.",Negative

AMD,Ugh why didn't they just come up with a dedicated audio connection instead.,Negative
AMD,there are multiple ways to expose an audio device over TB.  It is completely possible for a TB display to also act as a bridge so that it forwards all other attached TB device to the host (video source) meaning from the video source you can then select what audio output as it would show up just the same as if you attached that audio output directly to it.,Neutral
AMD,USB and PCIe are both standards that are channeled through TB.   A thunderbolt display can act as a TB/USB multiplexer so it exposes attached USB/PCIe devices to the upstream video source.   Thus letting any audio device attached to it be directly addressable from the video source.,Neutral
AMD,In no way.,Neutral
AMD,">Yes, devices on either end would need to be upgraded over time but we would have way, way less cable waste was more my point   But you can still use older cables, even with full-bandwidth HDMI 2.1 devices. It's not recommended, but nobody will stop you. If it doesn't work, an Ultra High Speed certified cable is only about $10/€10. That's not much when the AV receiver or soundbar alone costs one or more orders of magnitude more.   >How many HDMI cables do people have laying around from needing to upgrade to higher bandwidth cables, or worse threw them away and they're in landfill somewhere.

AMD,"It goes to the HDMI forum, being a member of the forum means you get a say in the spec and features of HDMI, you still have to pay licensing fees to use the port and to use certain branding words.",Neutral
AMD,"If they have done that then this wouldn’t be an issue because they would just use the hardware converter, but seeing as it is an issue, then they don’t have a hardware converter in there, the older Intel Arc GPUs don’t have both a straight HDMI connection from the GPU and a converted HDMI, the ones that had converted HDMI *only* had converted HDMI.",Neutral
AMD,"Well but that is the fault of the licence the open source project has picked. It's an issue purely caused by the FOSS project themselves, the GPL is actually meant precisely to not allow such things. They ruled themselves out by their choice. It's kinda their responsibility to deal with it whichever way they want - to convince others to comply, to find some Nvidia-like workaround, or to not have the feature if they don't want to.  HDMI creators don't have to comply, open source projects aren't magically entitled to have everybody go out of their way to serve their needs.  WRT DisplayPort, it's complicated. In theory it looks better just for the reason it is free so devices could be cheaper/have more ports etc. But for example DP 2.x was years late, so HDMI 2.1 kind of earned its place as the high-bandwidht solution for over 4K60 resolutions. There are the audio and synchronization things. AFAIK HDMI is better at working over longer cables, which DP 2.x has big issues with (the 80Gbps mode). Sadly we can expect HDMI 2.2 with 96Gbps bandwidth to again come to market much sooner than the DisplayPort alternative (though arguably, 96Gbps is not that much higher than 80Gbps, so as long as DP 2.1 UHBR20 actually becomes commonplace, maybe the alternative is here already).  So you can't really say the HDMI does nothing to justify its premium.  I also hear repeat complains about DisplayPort monitors having annoying quirks when going to sleep (icons/windows rearranged iirc). No idea if the prevalence of such problems is really bigger than on HDMI, of course. I don't quite remember having issues with HDMI myself.",Negative

AMD,we are working in fictional scenario where displayport is an option here. But also i guess it depends on your setup?

I have dozens in my closet that can't handle that bandwidth, nor the bandwidth of modern PC displays with high refresh rates and ultra wide resolutions. PCs would have also benefit from the optical cable solution.",Negative
AMD,"It'd be nice, but it would require a more powerful chip to exist - it's a pretty specialized thing, and you'd have a make back all of the money on designing and fabricating the chips (plus chip manufacturers are pretty slammed these days) and the only real use case I know of for these is for connecting TV to older GPUs or multiple TVs to GPUs with a single HDMI port.   I'd also have to see if you could draw enough power off of the power pin on the DP port to power anything significantly better  I don't really know, just throwing out some ideas of why they might not be gunning to do that right now",Neutral
AMD,"My point is we don't know yet, but we DO know they didn't do that on the Steam Deck.  It remains an issue for HDMI on Linux and AMD hardware either way, even if they do end up building in a workaround.  I hold more hope for that idea than Valve/AMD/anyone convincing the HDMI forum to stop being asshats about it though",Neutral
AMD,"Sure, the HDMI forum has that right and I have a right to call them assholes for it. They'll still be getting their licensing fees on the hardware either way, and it's doubtful HDCP would be any less secure because of an open implementation. Previous implementations have never been an issue in that regard.  There's also practical reasons why a closed source module is a bad idea. It becomes a debugging black box if there's ever an issue caused by that code.  I think the main thing with stuff rearranging on sleep is from the monitor appearing to be disconnected. I've seen the same thing happen with HDMI, but as with all things, your mileage may vary",Negative
AMD,"Ah, i never used a soundbar or know anyone who does.",Neutral
AMD,"A lot of the ""just use DP, not sure why you'd need HDMI"" comments on this subject feel like they're coming from people who just watch everything on their computer.

AMD,Ya true I’m just saying that ya it would work for the one situation where you’d be doing everything through the AVR and then ya it uses DisplayPort without sound.

AMD,sound bars the the most popular ways of getting better audio out of TVs.  And relatively cheep/simple compared to a full home audio set up.,Positive
AMD,"Because a simple TB/USB4 needs the support from the SOC maker and it would be a more expensive solution than just a display port input.  Display port should be able to walk with its legs, in order to star a transition (not a replacement because you still need HDMI support for a long time) it has to have the same feature as HDMI. It must have an eARC replacement, CEC etc.  HDMI is used because it has everything a TV needs and it's licensing cost are negligible.",Neutral
AMD,"What are you even talking about? You can't use the vast majority of the older cables with the latest bandwidth requirements. You end up with signal dropouts. And no I did not cheap out. It's just the reality that if you're taking years ago, the cables were only made to the specs required at the time.. It's like having a cable now that supports 48Gbps and in 10 more years you need a cable for 16K video or something (theoretical, obviously) and the best of the best cables of today probably wouldn't support 192Gbps or whatever the new bandwidth requirement is. We reached a point where the quality of the HDMI cable absolutely does matter now where years ago it did not because of far less bandwidth requirements. This is my point of repeated obsoletion because the cables are only made to be just enough for whatever the current best quality is.",Negative

AMD,it requires you put in a USB-4 Doc within the TV.   You would not directly attach the TV SOC to the USB4 as those chips do not support the needed dock like features that would let the TV pass through other devices as audio targets.  why would display port add eArc when the entier point of modern display port is that can be tunnelled within USB so can use that ecosystem and protools for device handshakes.,Neutral

They were also the owner of SD Card manufacturer Lexar, before they sold it to a company in China maybe 8-10 years ago. Same thought process, it was just even smaller of a piece of their business.

AMD,">This coupled with the recent shortages of RAM for consumers and subsequent rise in their prices has got me worried. If this trend continues and AI race actually takes off, where does that leave normal PC enthusiasts / DIY culture that started in 1980's. We can't assemble computers without RAM, SSDs or GPUs.  DIY PC pays by far the least for silicon of any market, so it eats last. You can expect DIY PC builds to not really be sensible for many quarters.   Regrettably, we are in the very early innings on this trend. Things will get a lot worse before they get better. The first sign that things are normalizing will be sensible pricing on OEM PC builds. They are able to make volume contracts than retail can't support.  >Plus, the recent thrust by both Intel and AMD to go for APU / integrated architecture makes me believe that the industry is pushing consumers towards locked hardware that cannot be customized, and we all would eventually be forced to use NUCs or laptops that come with soldered RAM and CPU or even worse, integrated SOC with GPU.  APUs make a lot more sense than low-end dGPU products. Making a dGPU requires a bunch of infrastructure components that add cost and size to the design. Those things make sense if you are building something big and powerful. If you are instead making a mainstream 1080p graphics solution, an integrated graphics solution with on-package memory is cheaper and better.  >Would love to know your views on how this thing will eventually play out. Do you think that this AI bubble will eventually pop bringing normalcy or can this bring out seismic shift in how we see computers?  ""The cure for high prices is high prices"". The memory market will eventually see either a new entrant or major new capacity coming online. However, a fab that broke ground today would have a hard time ramping to sufficient volume to change pricing before 2028. The existing players have a long track record of cartel behavior.  I don't expect a seismic shift in how we see computers. I expect it to be like crypto but bigger.",Negative

The PC you built for your uncle who edits photos and needed something a little more specific that a generic Dell shitbox, and used purely JEDEC spec RAM.

Micron NAND and DRAM is still going to make it's way to consumer DIY through commercial B2B sales to businesses like Kingston and Corsair, who will put it in RAM and SSDs sold to consumers. They are simply adopting the same business strategy as their competitors Samsung and Hynix. You can't buy a Samsung or Hynix branded RAM kit directly from a retailer, and nobody has ever seen that as a threat to PC DIY lol",Negative

More seriously as it's been mentioned Micron has likely wanted to exit the direct consumer market for some time. Remember they've shut their Lexar brand and sold it. They discontinued Ballistix. Now they're discontinuing Crucial.   Hynix doesn't have a consumer DDR5 division. They have a limited consumer SSD division. Samsung has a somewhat limited consumer DDR5 division (nothing that targets DIY enthuasists with ""heatpreaders""). They do have a large consumer electronics divison which includes SSDs however.",Negative

AMD,At least nowadays non-last gen hardware is more than enough for playing comfortably most games,Positive
AMD,"I think you're reading too much into that one event. Remember that Micron/Crucial ended their Ballistix branding with DDR5 three years ago. They never had much in the way of offerings in the DDR5 generation, and what die they had were the worst of the three DRAM manufacturers. Micron chips work best around 5200 and can range up to 5600, but any kits above that rating are utilizing extremely binned chips at high voltages. I don't know of any reason why Micron couldn't redesign their DRAM to be competitive, but they clearly chose not to. Even Samsung's memory clocks higher, though it doesn't clock anywhere close to SK Hynix chips nor can reach their timings.  It's worth pointing out the people who had the most trouble with memory on their DDR5 builds were more often than not using Micron or Samsung based kits. I'm sure the heavy returns hurt their financials. But you should realize that Micron's current DDR5 offering was about to be made moot. Intel already clocks over 7000, and AMD is going to (farking finally) launch its 2nd gen DDR5 controller that should move the bar well above the 6000 sweet spot. Not even OEMs are going to be buying 5200-5600 kits regardless of price, meaning without a die redesign the only space left to offload chips would be servers and that's what Micron is now doing.  The AI bubble will pop, money isn't infinite and spending billions to make a few million every quarter isn't sustainable. There is no magic market that will materialize to fill in that gap disparity. Short of creating a true AI that can act as a people replacement the AI bubble is going to pop... AI won't truly go away, we're stuck with it just like we're stuck with the internet. But we are very much in a bubble and it's hard to imagine a scenario where the hundreds of billions being blown on datacenter deployments won't end up with a massive overbuild of DCs that will cause multiple bankruptcies in the future. I used to think there would always be enough demand elsewhere to keep former-AI DC's in use, but we're quickly building past that level.  As for breaking up NVIDIA, I'm not sure how that'd be feasible, they design a single base tier uArch and then scale it across all market segments. Forking the company into a consumer-only GPU division would probably just create another Radeon situation where the company keeps prices high to amortize its dev costs across the consumer market, instead of across all of its markets.  Micron isn't going anywhere, they're just focusing exclusively on servers and enterprise where the margins are largest and product support is easiest. The other day I read that Micron is now going to build a $9.6 billion dollar HBM fab in Japan. It's unfortunate but not unexpected, all three HBM vendors have been selling out their entire annual HBM production 12-18 months in advance since 2023. If other DRAM vendors still existed they would've already jumped ship to chase those silly numbers too.  Maybe at some point in the future when there's a single vendor for some piece of the computer hardware the market might be at risk. But it seems unlikely, because OEMs buy consumer level hardware and in order to supply OEMs they have to produce the same parts consumers would buy regardless. In Micron's case the DRAM they're producing isn't even good enough to meet OEM's needs, let alone consumers.  Edit: Will say I've been corrected, Micron does make a newer gen die for DDR5 that tops out at 6400 in 16/24Gb flavors, and it's even available under their own branding. But it's sure not common and still suffers from high timings.",Negative

Obviously that affects NVIDIA's pricing too because they can only produce a limited amount while paying a lot for that too.   AI on top of that is causing even more issues because of the margin they shift the limited supply towards server GPU's which means even less space for lower pricing.

AMD,"Depends on price. Word on the street is that AMD gave Valve a reaaally good deal on 7600 dies.   Essentially it appears that AMD produced way too many Navi 33 dies, using an older node (6nm) to make them cheaper and more plentiful, expecting to put a lot of them in laptops. Apparently, OEMs preferred the more expensive (and more efficient) 4060 instead, and that left AMD with lots of Navi33 (RX 7600) dies on their hands.  Talking to AMD Valve probably saw an opportunity to take this excess capacity for cheap, and AMD saw an opportunity to recoup some cost, rather than risk throwing them away. I can imagine Valve getting those RX 7600 cards for maybe half the price of what a 9060XT would be (depending on memory prices).",Neutral

AMD,"I saw an interesting video yesterday where the guy tested a Steam Machine-like config (6 cores, RX7600) to see how it performed and yeah... not good when RT involved at advertised 4k, Indiana Jones was unplayable.  Even non-RT loads required very low settings.  New games are going to really test that hardware, I think RT is a total non starter on it as well.",Negative
AMD,Exactly.  I wouldnt consider a 3060 useable without dlss working wonders.  Especially at 4k where you need dlss performance or ultra performance.  Trying to do that without a proper upscaler is going to produce hideous results.,Neutral
AMD,"$1000 also isn't a great look for a console killer. Between Sony releasing the PS5 Pro at a really steep price ($750/€800), both Microsoft jacking up the Xbox Series price (X for $650) and Sony doing the same (PS5 for $550) and Nintendo charging quite a bit more for the Switch 2 ($450) I'd say there's an opening here for a Steam Machine to enter the console market.  If Valve can release something that can compete with these consoles, at a similar price, with a similar feature set, but with also all the advantages of being a computer, then it's definitely worth it. Going from $1000 to $700 will open a huge market for Valve. Going to $600 would be the nail in the coffin for Xbox.   No online fees, lower game prices, your game library will never expire, infinite game catalogue, and you can use it as your main PC as well, for the same price as a normal console... Not a bad sales pitch.  BTW, lots of people are using a Steam Deck as their main console. If millions are happy with Deck performance, this is more than enough. If you want better, build your own, unlike with classic consoles, you can easily do it now.",Neutral
AMD,I doubt there are enough defective ones to be all salvaged. It'll be like the consoles where they're cut back to ensure as many dies can be used as possible,Negative
AMD,"I'm hoping $600, unless RAM prices fuck it all up and it becomes $700-800",Negative
AMD,Valve isn’t buying individual components at retail price.,Neutral
AMD,More and more games demand RT and even software RT is vram heavy. Doom the dark ages can run much better on the 7600xt compared to its 8gb version even though they're the same card with only mild clock differences,Neutral
AMD,"If the 9060XT can utilize 16GB, so can a 9060. The performance difference is imperceptible without a framerate counter.",Neutral
AMD,"Plus, much easier to integrate into a smaller form factor than shrinking down a desktop GPU. The Steam machine is basically a screen-less laptop hosting a Ryzen 7640 (without iGPU) plus an RX 7600M, but with a huge-ass heatsink and fan to properly allow for higher clocks.",Neutral
AMD,It's honestly hilarious. AMD will have zero FSR4 compatible mobile product at all until 2027 without hacky aftermarket solutions. Mind you laptop sales began to outpace desktop about two decades ago.,Negative
AMD,Remember KFConsole,Neutral
AMD,"Some people are just that delusional, best case scenario AMD gives valve extremely faulty strix halo chips that are cut down by more than 50%. That individual straight up said it will be fully custom.",Negative
AMD,"Except it's not even a desktop 7600, it's a mobile 7600m. Another 4CU cut.",Negative
AMD,"I think this thing makes no sense at all.  Especially since you re not just buying a new low end gpu to put into an old pc for cheap to give it some new life.  No , you re buying cpu, gpu, ram, ssd, mobo, case, power supply  Thats a ton of money.  And the performance wont justify the price at all.",Negative
AMD,"The 4k claim is really weird. On old games, sure. But am 8GB 7600 is a 1080p GPU, which isn't even that bad on a TV, especially since upscaling 1080p content is kind of a TV's bread and butter",Negative
AMD,"599 is ideal but I’d tolerate 699. Speaking of the RAM shortage, I get reminded of how Valve launched Steam Deck during the worst of COVID shortage, so I am somewhat hopeful",Negative
AMD,"Cool, but individual components involve free assembly by you, steam machine needs assembling and to make money.",Neutral
AMD,"Slapping the chip from the RX 9060/XT onto a laptop style motherboard would not be technically any more difficult than using the 7600M chip. The 7600M is itself just a slightly cutdown, underclocked desktop RX 7600 chip.  Both chips are physically pretty much the same size (200 mm2 give or take a few) and the desktop versions have very similar power usage.   The only reason to use the RX 7600 over the RX 9060 chip in this application is cost.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah he mentioned that... result will be worse. 4K60 is going to be a very limited thing, marketing beware etc but I hope people are prepared for a little/lot of choppiness.",Negative
AMD,"Because of frame gen and upscaling, they can say it’s any output resolution any output frame rate and it’s technically not lying. It’s a useless piece of info without details.",Negative
AMD,"The steam machine doesn’t need to make money. The steam machine needs to get people to play PC games, which steam has an effective monopoly on. If Valve sells the steam machine at cost they’ll make money.",Neutral
AMD,"I agree, but it's still more work than just slapping the existing laptop board that's already engineered with the proper footprint, connections, inputs and outputs in there, because AFAIK there's no RDNA4 laptop parts at all and the most we have are the RDNA3.5 GPU in the PS5 Pro and the AI APUs",Neutral
AMD,Any corporate mention of resolution and framerate is completely meaningless now because it only refers the output. It could be achieved by upscaling from 540p and with 4x frame gen (amd doesn't use it atm) and it still wouldn't be technically lying.,Negative
AMD,Frame gen and upscaling can't solve a lack of VRAM in many games either though (frame gen makes it even worse). Unless they're talking about FSR1 lol,Negative
AMD,"Yes it does, it can't be loss leader because otherwise people will just buy it for office use. They said it themselves.",Neutral
AMD,"Who is buying a steamOS machine for office use? Which office is going to bother buying this instead of any of the hundreds or thousands of offerings from T1 SIs that actually provide support and service? This thing doesn’t even use standard components, are you even going to get official drivers on Windows?",Negative
AMD,"They promoted the steam machine as being able to install other OS. If they don't support it then I suppose at least it would be really funny for how much people glazed them for it.   There will be companies buying it if it's cost effective due to valve eating costs. Hell, even if they don't, valve just have no control over it's userbase, it could have a really low acquisition rate from non steam users, just like steam deck, so all that loss leading would be for nothing.  If you are right then it's a pc, that you can't upgrade, that can't play hugely popular games like league of legends, GTA, battlefield or valorant. Device designed not for casuals and not for enthusiast. Just people who are okay with paying a lot of money to play old, locked in time, singleplayer games on TV. It has to support windows.",Neutral
AMD,"No sizable company is buying a ton of computers to replace the OS on them, especially not for this level of hardware. No normal user is buying a Steam Machine running SteamOS from Steam because they really want a Linux desktop.  The problem with charging a PC price instead of a console price is that it’s just worse than an actual gaming PC. Even with all the advances Valve has made to Linux gaming you still can’t play a lot of popular multiplayer titles, and hardware wise it’s essentially a 5-year old console. There’s just no justification to pay more than $500-600 for one of these.",Negative
AMD,"If you are only looking for pure gaming performance and want to maximize your FPS, go with the R5 5500X3D.",Neutral

AMD,"don’t get a 5060 get a 9060xt… there are so many reviews on this man idk why people still think thst the 5060 is a good card. If your solely focused on gaming, get a ryzen 5 7600 for am5 or if you really want to do am4 get the 5500x3d",Negative
AMD,"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/am4-lives-amd-ryzen-5-5500x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks  The 5500X3D occasionally beats the **14900K.**  If you stream or occasionally do professional work like rendering or video editing then the 14400F can be a better choice, but for pure gaming, X3D chips tend to perform at least one generation ahead of non-X3D chips in their product line.  One asterisk is the motherboard though, if the 5500X3D uses a 300- or 400-series motherboard with PCI-E 3.0, the RTX 5060 could be hurting big time in modern games. The 14400F almost certainly uses PCI-E 4.0 or 5.0 which will be better for that GPU.",Neutral

AMD,"> Upgrading to RAM ddr5 is out of the question  Well, then you certainly won't be looking at AM5.   14600K / 14700K are probably the best CPUs you can buy and still use DDR4.",Neutral
AMD,"If you're not looking at ddr5, then go with intel",Neutral
AMD,"Well, then it's down to either AM4 or Intel 12-14th gen. If you aren't already on a AM4 system that you can upgrade, then Intel's 12-14th gen usually has better overall performance, albeit at a MUCH higher power draw and more heat. The only AM4 chips that can compete in games with Alder/Raptor like is the 5000X3D chips, and they go for quite a premium in the used market rn.  Just so you know, both of these are basically died platforms. There is no ""future proofing"" these things anymore, because they are essentially last generation products that people SHOULD have been upgrading from, if it was not for the DRAM situation. You can probably squeeze some remaining life out of them with this generation of GPUs with minor CPU bottleneck on higher tier GPUs, but I'd expect them to be severely CPU limited come RTX 6000 or UDNA, save the lowest models.",Neutral
AMD,What are you upgrading from?,Neutral
AMD,"I would try to find a used Z790 DDR4 board. Personally, I would hate to have a K-series CPU and not be able to touch voltages and clocks. That goes double for Raptor Lake. A used Z690 board would do fine, as well.",Negative
AMD,Definitely Intel,Neutral
AMD,"Appreciate things are tight. But if I were you, I would take the hit and go for a AM5 board with DDR5 RAM and Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU or similar.",Neutral
AMD,14600 is a good chip. But it seems ddr4 cpu's are going up in price.,Positive
AMD,"Bro, since you're going for a powerful build with something like a 5070, both Intel and Ryzen can work — but the choice depends on what you want:  • If you want higher gaming performance and better single-core speeds: Go for Intel i7 or i9. Intel usually gives a slight edge in high-FPS gaming.  • If you want better multitasking, productivity, or streaming on the side: Go for Ryzen 7 or Ryzen 9. Ryzen usually offers better efficiency and more cores for the price.  Honestly, with such a strong GPU, just avoid the i5 or Ryzen 5 — they’ll bottleneck the build. Stick to i7/i9 or Ryzen 7/9 and you’ll get the full performance out of your setup.  And try to upgrade the RAM to ddr5, ddr4 time has ended and now times many are using or choosing ddr5 over ddr4.",Positive
AMD,Go for a 14600k and a b760 ddr4 mobo,Neutral
AMD,"I have a 14600k, it's amazing and will accept both ddr4 and ddr5 for future. It's definitely overpowered for most games. The K is almost same price as KF and probably worth an extra 20-30$ for onboard graphics if you can manage",Positive
AMD,"Intel, AMD is a headache",Neutral
AMD,yeah sounds fine basically just getting am5 non x3d perf at a cheaper price at the cost of upgradability,Positive

AMD,I5 14600k is plenty for an 5070 wdym?,Neutral
AMD,"LGA1700 Motherboards either take DDR4 or DDR5, depending on which one you purchase, not both. If OP goes DDR4, then there’ll be no point getting the DDR5 version later, it would make way more sense to get a LGA1954 motherboard instead, for Intel Nova Lake (or AM5 for Zen 6).  A 14600K is in no way overpowered for most games, though it does depend on what you mean by “overpowered” here. It’s certainly been shown that a 9800X3D very much outclasses it in gaming where CPU-bound (therefore higher fps).",Neutral
AMD,"Well, i said the Zen 3 X3D can compete in games with Alder/Raptor Lake, not that they are faster. And yes, i agree Alder/Raptor lake like has the better performance overall. It's newer obviously. Zen 3 was meant to compete against Comet/Rocket Lake.",Positive
AMD,No I was just suggesting to him that the i7 would be better with a 5070 as that would give him a better experience.,Positive

AMD,"Yeah me too bro. I guess we will have to leave it up to him. It's not an essential choice, i5 14th gen is enough for 5070, but if he wants to future proof it or make it a bit more high end, let him decide  Nice chatting with you. 🫂",Neutral
AMD,"Yup! AMD is super efficient and in turn they are cooler, plus air coolers are really good too. AIOs are just for looks at this point tbh.",Positive
AMD,"very few people NEED water cooling, and 7800x3D is a long way from that need category.    90% of AIO cooling out there is for the cool factor, and if that makes them happy, awesome.  But dont get sucked into thinking its a necessity for most.",Positive
AMD,"I have the 7800X3D and i’m not a fan of watercooling so I went with Noctua NH-D15 and the case is Fractal Pop XL (silent black solid, not sure how many versions are) + 2x extra fans on top.  I usually get around 62-65C on both cpu and gpu in heavy load. In the worst case I have seen 70C but the room temp was above 25c and my rig is very close to the heater.  I’m not sure how a mid tower will handle the heat.",Negative
AMD,"The major difference between an air cooler and an AIO cooler is where the heat is dumped.    Assuming you have typical case fans for the Meshy 3 to move the hot air out of the case, you will be fine.",Neutral

AMD,You shouldnt need an AIO at all with a CPU that barely hits 80watts under a full synthetic load.   $30 Peerless Assassin is more than enough for the 7800X3D.,Neutral
AMD,"No, you don't. All that air coming in will get pushed out by the pressure just fine unless you block the flow with something.  I use a Phantom Spirit Evo in a Meshify 3 with a 9800X3D and it's basically impossible to get it hot enough to even need to think about it.

The Intel has a better CPU, *sometimes*, but then not by too much, the AMD a better GPU (2-4x faster), *but* Intel's IGP also comes with Quicksync, if fast video encoding/transcoding at decent quality is of import (recent NVidia encoders are about as good, if you go with a card). Without one really important application or use case that differentiates them, I think the AMD option offers better value, with IGP, ATM, but both are good. Without IGP, comparing a 5600X, flip a coin - it's all going to depend on which benchmark you prioritize, then, and the prices will likely be within $20.",Neutral
AMD,"The 12600K is better than 5600G, it matches or slightly beats 5600X so it's a good choice for office PC.",Positive
AMD,"If it's not going to be for gaming, I say get a 5600G (or GT, if cheaper, like right now), a mobo with at least 2 DP or HDMI outputs, preferably at least one being DP, so dual-monitor becomes an option, and skip a video card completely. For office stuff, any CPU not severely crippled, like a Celeron, will be about as fast as anything else, from the last several years. Benchmarks find ways to turn a +10% speed increase into +120% across 12 threads, when it's one thread doing all the actual work, and it's really only saving a few milliseconds. Doing modeling, up to 1440P or so, or dual 1080P, Vega IGP is quite capable. 4K starts getting a little dodgy, with DDR4 system RAM as VRAM.  The MSI B550M PRO-VDH WIFI might be a good alternative board, with DP and HDMI available, WiFi and BT to optionally use, and also having BIOS Flashback.  Since prices are going crazy, **if and only if** you can get a 3600CL18 kit for not much more than 3200CL16, do that, for the extra GPU bandwidth, if going with IGP.

AMD,">Is there a real difference if you don't use them for crazy stuff?  not really, main differences will be in edgecases, overall AMD will have better raw performance, and intel will have more features like intel QuickSync on their iGPUs for media encoding, vPRO management, and stuff like that  if you don't really need the computer for anything very specific, AMD is generally the better choice because you get better raw performance  >ADM Version **Motherboard:** GIGABYTE B550M DS3H **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5 **5600G** 3.9GHz box  avoid the G series if you're gonna be getting a dedicated GPU, there are compromises here like only having 8x lanes to the top PCIe slot, so if you add a dedicated GPU later, it will only operate at half the bandwidth, it's not a huge deal, but it's unnecessary, get a 5600/5600x if you're getting a dedicated GPU anyways  >What would you recommend between AMD and Intel?  i'd pick AMD, it's cheaper for the same performance, and you don't have to deal with efficiency cores accidentally makeing your experience worse, i run a 5800x3d in my main PC, and i couldn't be happier with my choice",Neutral
AMD,"Just to give the reasoning, the 5600g has less cache (16Mb) vs the 5600(x) (32MB) so 5600g + GPU is slower than the 5600(x) + GPU.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes. For office work the 5600x is around 10% faster, but in some games the difference can be more dramatic, especially in the critical low frame rate category. The 5700x gives you 8/16 and is cheaper than the 5600G (at least where I am - try looking for tray prices as well to compare). But then you need to get a GPU at the beginning. With the intel you have the best performance of all (not by too much) and can coast on the iGPU for awhile. But as you said, the GPU prices will go up due to memory prices and you will need one to game.  edit - for strictly gaming the 5600x is presently the best bet of the AM4 CPUS by a tiny bit as the 5700x splits the cores and cache differently. But if you end up needing those cores, the 5700x pulls handily ahead. The best would be a 5800X3D, but they are impossible to find new and cost too much used.",Neutral

DDR5 is just so stupendously expensive it hardly makes sense to get it in terms of value if you already have 32GB of decent DDR4. AM4 is just as dead as LGA 1700, and the 14600K performs pretty great, even with DDR4 better than a 5700X3D in most games.

AMD,Yes absolutely there is. The AM5 platform is supported until 2027. Thats the definition of future proof.,Neutral
AMD,"If ddr5 prices did not skyrocketed, it would be a hard pass on am4, but as it is. Check pricing and calculate.",Neutral
AMD,That's the point. Yeah youre going to spend more but instead of having 2 or 3 more years of am4 you'll get the ridiculously long life still left in AM5 so you'll only need to upgrade gpu's and cpu's.,Neutral
AMD,"That's very solid DDR4.  > isn't 13th and 14th gen intel has some performance issues?  Not performance but degradation, mostly happening to their 700 and 900 CPUs, but it's been fixed with bios updates.  I'd look at pricing of the 14600K and a decent B660/B760/Z690/Z690 board and see if that's cheaper than the 5700X3D plus B550M.

AMD,is it better than the other ones?,Positive
AMD,so im hearing i should go ddr4 intel i5-14600 then eventually ddr5 amd am5,Neutral

AMD,"Not worth it to change motherboard just because of the RAM, in that case I would pick a newer CPU with new mobo+ram too.",Neutral
AMD,"Games do not benefit from core count, but from bigger cache memory and better architecture, so i7 doesn't mean it is better than i5.

AMD,"Yes, 6 core Ryzen 5 5600 for example can beat previous gen 16 core Ryzen 3950x in gaming because of quite better architecture. Of course this is not the case in productivity tasks, which can utilize multi core.  Also noticed from other commends you mentioning AM5, honesty i5 14600K is still a very good CPU, I don't see you needing to replace it any time soon unless you are aiming for the best possible performance with Ryzen 7 9800x3D or upcoming 11800x3D (or whatever number will the next gen be).  i5 14600K + RTX 5070 is a very good combo.

AMD,OMG.  I just built an Am5 9000 series for not much money.  It's so good. Don't even bother with Intel.,Positive
AMD,"Interesting, Build 1 should be significantly cheaper due to DDR4 vs DDR5. Same price, AM5 all day here.",Positive
AMD,AM5 platform of course.. I'd think the Intel setup would be much cheaper because of what it is,Neutral
AMD,"AMD.  AM5 will support at CPUs to at least Zen 6.  That platform has a long life.  If you go with Intel, no upgrade path to future CPUs - you’re stuck with 14th gen as the only upgrade path.  I made the mistake of building my last rig using Intel, thinking I can always upgrade to the best 11th gen but new CPUs in 12th, 13th, 14th gen are even cheaper than equivalent 11th gen retail with updated features and the used market are charging near retail for old tech.",Neutral
AMD,"Second build because it gets you on AM5, both have shit GPUs.",Negative
AMD,If they are the same price AMD platform for sure.,Neutral
AMD,"If you can, AMD because it's a newer system and will upgrade better. The next generation of AMD processors will likely be a significant leap above current (30-40% after IPC, boost and other optimizations) and will hopefully be a drop in replacement. Buy once so you don't have to buy again.",Positive
AMD,Amd for this particular scenario.,Neutral
AMD,"The 13600 is a fine cpu but at equal price, the 9600X is the better value.   I would expect there to be a minimum $125 or so difference (intel costing less) due to DDR4.

AMD,Yes. Get a 5800xt. Or a used 5800x/5700x. It's your best option unless you want to pay premium for a Zen 3 X3D chip.,Neutral
AMD,5700x is a substantial upgrade from 3700x.  Of course 5700x3D is better in games but twice the price.,Positive
AMD,"I have a similarly powered build. Not exactly matching, but roughly similar weight class, anyway.  3600XT CPU  5700XT GPU  32GB 3600mHz RAM  2TB 980 Pro  Honestly, I might do what you're thinking of and upgrade to a maxed out AM4 and wait for AM6 or 7. I don't want to wait for RAM prices to go down to build a whole new computer. I think you should go ahead and upgrade your current rig.",Neutral
AMD,"5800x + 9070 will be your best budget bet...but that 550W psu is stretching it a little. Also check if its modular and actually has the correct cables for a new card.  I run a 5700x3d / 5070ti (3x8pin power) on a 750W just fine so you might be ok, but check with the GPU specifications.  If you upgrade your PSU & budget, your options will stretch your AM4's longevity somewhat.",Neutral
AMD,"RTX 5060 Ti (16GB VRAM ideally). This is non-negotiable for your LLM goal. Ryzen 7 5700X is likely your best bet if you want to avoid the X3D price/cache-only focus but still want a huge performance jump. If you pair the RTX 5060 Ti with the Ryzen 7 5700X, you have a much better shot at running the whole rig safely on your 550W PSU.",Positive

AMD,I have the B850 version of this board and it’s pretty solid. as far as I can tell the B650E and B850 versions of this board are identical. definitely a good deal,Positive
AMD,My budget would probably be around 200-250. My case I feel like is a pretty decent size but I don't need something massive. And features would probably have to be a decent amount of USB slots since I used a lot of those on my current mobo as well as ease of use in the BIOS since I know I'll probably have to update that,Neutral
AMD,I have this motherboard. The first one wouldn't read all DIMM slots. It got changed under warranty. They sent me a refurbished unit. The second one would crash all the time. I was using the onboard graphics temporarily until I bought a gpu. The screen would freak out then crash. I bought a third one because I didn't want to get another refurbished unit. I have a water cooled system and didn't want to redo my lines. Luckily this one is fine. Asus isn't what they used to be.,Negative
AMD,> I assumed the i7 9700 would outperform the Ryzen 7 3700 based off of benchmarks I've seen.   Please don't tell me you used UserBenchmark.,Negative
AMD,"> Is this to be expected?  Yes.  Which benchmarks were you seeing? The i7-9700 non-K has a 65 watt power target and is hobbled even compared to the 9700K, which the Ryzen 7 3700 already beats handily in multithreaded productivity workloads.  It also will look like it's at higher load in lightly threaded tasks like games because it doesn't have SMT, which doubles the threads available to the 3700X. If six threads are fully loaded on the i7-9700 it'll show 75% load, whereas those same six threads will put the R7 3700 at around 40% apparent load for the same rough performance.",Neutral
AMD,"Yea, the ryzen 7 is newer and is WAY better at multi core tasks (16 cores vs i7s 8). The ryzen 7 also has a 32mb L3 cache vs a 12mb L3 cache in the I7. This pretty much allows it to store copies of data and instructions that the CPU is likely to need next, which allows for faster access than retrieving them from the RAM. So overall, the ryzen 7 is going to be better and faster.",Positive
AMD,Did you get your information from  userbenchmark.com  Because you should read the automod comment below.,Neutral
AMD,"The 9700 and 3700 are comparable in single-thread speed, but the 3700 has SMT and the 9700 does not. That doubles your thread count, and is ~50-60% more multi-core performance.",Neutral
AMD,To put it simply 9th gen intel is 1 year older than 3rd gen ryzen.,Neutral
AMD,The 9700 is an 8 core/8 thread CPU that came out in late 2018 and is still on their ancient 14nm process.   The 3700 is a newer 2019 CPU with 8 cores and 16 threads built on 7nm. You fell for some bogus benchmark sites.,Neutral
AMD,"No, however probably a similar site, technical.city   PassMark score were more comparable, but the 9700 still had the slight edge. Ryzen 7 3700 performs about 50% better than the 9700 in my cinibench testing.",Neutral
AMD,I was checking pass mark single core scores as well as checking a few different sites.    I'm primarily concerned with single core performance. From what I had found the 9700 should have had a bit of an edge. In my cinibench testing the Ryzen 7 3700 achieved about 50% better single core scores.,Neutral
AMD,"Thanks for the reply.    My primary concern is single core performance. My research told me the 9700 would have a slight edge, but the Ryzen 7 3700 beats the single core performance by about 50%.    Do you think that's to be expected?",Positive
AMD,"They are both 8 cores btw, i dont think any ryzen 7s on am4 had 16 cores",Neutral
AMD,"16 threads, not 16 cores.  They’re both 8 core chips but Intel only enabled HyperThreading on the i9 that generation.  There’s only a year difference between them (3000 series went head to head with 10th Gen Core).    I think your mention of RAM might be on to something.  Prebuilts have a nasty tendency to only use one DIMM to cut costs.  This was also peak Intel “upsell by hobbling lower SKUs” and they set very low supported RAM speeds for the parts a prebuilt might use.  If it has one stick of like DDR4-2400 that could definitely explain the issue.",Neutral

AMD,A few places. I know I for sure I checked PassMark scores as well as technical.city (which doesn't seem very trustworthy),Neutral
AMD,"I'm finding it strange that the 3700 is outperforming the single core performance by about 50%.    It's the primary reason I bought the 9700 PC, as it was supposed to offer about 10-20% higher single core speeds.",Negative
AMD,"Actually you missread or confuse a lot in technical city, the ryzen 7 you probably looked up is the 3700U the notebook one, the pc ones are pro and X and both pass the 9700 for between 70% and 50% on passmark",Neutral
AMD,Did you use userbenchmark? It lies and favors intel heavily,Neutral
AMD,"Single core performance is moot.  All modern games are able to utilize multiple cores and threads.  You effectively traded down a generation with no hyperthreading, half the threads, and effectively worse in every conceivable application   The 3700x has 16 threads, the 9700 has 8 - and of course the more threads, the more it will trounce the opponent.  The GHZ counts on either doesn't mean anything as it is ONLY useful in comparing two of the exact same model of silicon.",Negative
AMD,Something is amiss with the Intel system. Their single-core performance should be within 5-10% of one another. The Ryzen should smoke the Intel system in multi-core speeds.,Neutral
AMD,"No it’s not honestly, but depending on both the pcs RAM and cooling systems, the ryzen could have been more sustained due to other factors, what are the specs of both pcs?",Neutral
AMD,The faster one actually only has one stick. The slower one has two sticks. Both 16 GB ram.    Both are also pre-builts.,Neutral
AMD,"I think you're right. That's likely what happened with technical city, which is what really through my expectations off.    Comparing PassMark single thread scores, single core performance should be more or less the same as far as I can tell though.",Neutral
AMD,I mostly emulate which primarily utilizes singe core performance + GPU for upscaling.    The newest game I play is from 2011 so a lot of those features are lost on me.,Neutral
AMD,I'm thinking it might come down to cooling or Dell restricting power more than the Lenovo. Goddam gonna be another long night,Neutral
AMD,"They are very similar, however the Ryzen PC is a little worse in most ways.    Lenovo / Ryzen: single 16GB DDR4 @ 2666 MHz. 210 Watt PSU. GTX 1050 2 GB. 512 NVME.    Dell / Intel: 2x8GB DDR4 @ 2666. 300 watt PSU. GTX 1650. 512 GB NVME.    Both have propriety coolers and PSUs.    The only 2 reasons I could think are that:   1. The cooler / thermal paste on the Lenovo are superior or holding up better over time. [The Dell / Intel get a bit warmer and experience higher temp spikes]   2. Dell limits the power of the chip more than Lenovo.",Neutral
AMD,"That’s extra weird then.  When you say that the Dell gets hotter, how spicy we talking?  100C in Cinebench by any chance?",Neutral
AMD,"Possibly, i know this sucks for you im sorry. Underperforming is never good.",Negative
AMD,"Oh it's a Dell... right. Yeah it's almost certainly something with the cooling, RAM speed, or board power limits. Dell is awful.",Negative
AMD,"On HW info Dell is typically 78-82⁰C. The max temp is 95⁰C. Weird thing is, the temps in the ""current"" column never exceed 85⁰C, however the ""max"" temp column still slowly increases up to 95⁰C - maybe momentary spikes.    With the Lenovo it runs at 78-80⁰C, except the max temp it reaches is 83⁰C.",Neutral
AMD,"I've been getting some weird temp spikes on HW info, so in leaning more towards the cooling.    Considering applying thermal paste. Might just keep the Lenovo with a weaker gpu. This PC gives me bad vibes lol",Negative
AMD,So it’s at least not bouncing off TJmax.  That’s still hot enough that I wonder if it’s thermal throttling.  Bouncing off 95 C is kind of expected with current stuff under load but I don’t think it was the norm in 2018.    You can check to see if it is maintaining boost clocks through a run.  You should be seeing something like 4.7 GHz for ST and 4.5 GHz for MT.  If it’s not boosting past the base 3 GHz that would explain the difference you’re seeing.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah I'm wondering. I also once had a package ring thermal throttle for a brief second, but that was it.    It boosted to 4.7, but hovered around 3.8 for the majority of the test.    I appreciate the reply",Neutral
AMD,Are you having trouble running anything? You’re over thinking this imo,Negative
AMD,"I have similar system except the GPU, which is a 6800XT (>5% difference XD) and the RAM, which is 3600MHz for me, I'm waiting out AM6 and the next gen cards, had no problem with any game (even new ones) at 1440p tho I was forced to the use of FSR, speaking of FSR, I still have hope that we get a better version than 3.1 for older cards too.....",Positive
AMD,I think you will be fine for a while yet.,Positive
AMD,"Not really, more thinking how long it will last with newer games since it feels like with each new game release the spec requirements are higher and higher. Like when will I have to update or change to ddr5.",Neutral
AMD,"Depends entirely on what games you want to play in the future, how well they are optimized, and how low you're willing to drop your settings. If you don't demand the very best, then you'll be fine for years.   Also you can't upgrade just to DDR5, it will require a new CPU and motherboard.",Neutral
AMD,I hope you have ddr5 ram already,Neutral
AMD,"5700x is a big upgrade over the 5700g just because of 32MB of L3 cache.   9600x has faster cores, only 6 of them compared to 8 but overall ot wins out in both single and multithreaded workloads.   If you have am4 mobo and ddr4 ram the 5700x is best bang for buck at like $100. ​  If you want am5 and can spend like $700 on cpu, mobo and ddr5 ram then do that, but remember 9600x is just 10% faster in multicore passmark, and 25% faster single core.",Neutral
AMD,With the cost of DDR5 right now its probably not going to be worth switching platforms until things settle down.   >but it cost $275 USD and seemed too expensive  where are you seeing that because its $183 [on amazon](https://www.amazon.com/AMD-RyzenTM-5800XT-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0D6NNDQ92) right now,Negative

AMD,"Thankfully and also unfortunately I'm gaming less and less every day, I don't consider myself old but I'm getting tired more easily and I'd rather unwind watching something than gaming these days.   That all being said, I still love the dance before building a new rig, watching reviews, comparing prices, using PCPP to check that everything will fit, go to the subreddits to get opinions, pull the trigger, wait for the hardware to arrive, take my Saturday to put it together and fire it up for the first time is the closest I'll have to having a child.   But now every time I try to juggle the parts list and the prices it makes no damn sense to upgrade. I don't even really need to it's just my love for building rigs and passing down my old ones to my brother or other family members.   I was waiting for the end of the year to do it but with RAM prices having gone through the roof it makes no sense at all, like I was counting on getting a normal 6000Mhz CL30 kit, they were going for 120/140 bucks, now they're over 300 or more.   Heck I almost bought a 2x24GB 6000Mhz CL26 kit for 320 bucks three months ago to call it a day and I chickened out thinking they would get cheaper lol.   I remember this happened with DDR4 around 2018 or so, but the prices were still somewhat acceptable, like a good kit was around 90/110 and they went to 180/200. Expensive, but not deal breakers.

AMD,it is a scam. nothing else.,Negative
AMD,"They're raising prices because sales of CPUs, motherboards, and other DIY PC components have plummeted in recent months due to DDR5 memory prices surging. This sales drop has forced AMD to lower their forward guidance for their CPU business, and the only short term prayer they have to combat this drop in revenue is to raise prices and push these parts up-segment.  Basically, gaming PCs are, in the near future, moving away from higher volume mass market to lower volume luxury and will be priced accordingly.",Negative

AMD,they were already expensive and now they are gonna rise it even more?  I guess I'll stay with my intel motherboard a bit more... at least until AM6.,Negative
AMD,"Maybe hot take or unpopular opinion, but PC parts are still historically cheaper than ever before. I remember my dad bringing home a Pentium 2 that was like $5000.

AMD,"Or maybe they just don't drop price at all and keep it like that forever, just like how Nvidia did GPU.",Neutral
AMD,to be fair anyone who's building a gaming PC and putting up with these ram prices won't bat an eye at an extra 10-15% CPU cost,Negative
AMD,"I don’t think that’s the idea because CPU prices aren’t going to drop back down unless RAM prices do to. Anyone buying a new CPU has to also buy RAM, so CPUs aren’t going to sell much more just because they’re cheaper if RAM prices aren’t the bottleneck.  I think it’s more likely that they recognize that overall sales will go down due to RAM costs, and anyone looking to buy a CPU in the next few years will be less price sensitive since they’re willing to shell out for RAM. I’d imagine they’re doing this then to offset the lower volume.",Neutral
AMD,"It helps compensate for lower sales volume. If you know demand for your product is relatively inelastic you can increase your prices in the face of market headwinds to make greater margin at reduced volume. It does leave you open to being undercut by your competitors, but AMD is so far ahead in CPU right now that they might feel they can take the risk.",Neutral

AMD,i built my PC this year (august). i literally did it at the perfect time.,Positive
AMD,"Just finished my build a few weeks ago slowly buying parts over the previous month and a half.  I got every single part under MSRP, including the 5080, except for the damn Ram.  But even then I avoided the worst of the price hike.  Paid $240 for 32 gb of 6000 CL30 beginning of November.  Same kit costs $480 now.  Prices are going to be nutty when the Ram spike and subsequent shortage settles and trickles down to GPUs, prebuilts, etc along with whatever tariff bullshit Trump is doing.",Negative

AMD,They’re not going to make less money just because a small number of people decide to stop buying.  They’ll just pivot to AI or to enterprise-related buyers.  AMD doesn’t have chip fabs.  TSMC makes their 9000 series CPU’s for them.  I’m sure they can tell TSMC to manufacture something else.,Neutral
AMD,What ecosystem can sustain that though?,Neutral
AMD,That doesn't work for processors. There will always be chips that don't test at 100% speed so they lower the price and sell them as a lesser model. It's not like they're just going to trash the ones that only function at 90%.,Negative
AMD,"No clue what you are talking about. GPUs have usually been the most expensive parts.  Why are people even downvoting this? A 7500F system went from 350-400$ to spending close to that ON THE RAM ALONE. So entry level AM5 can cost about $600 right now. People who can't afford this, will just not upgrade, i.e. not buy CPUs. Meaning: Sales go down.  GPUs have no direct relation to ANY other part prices, so I have no clue what they mean with their comment. You can upgrade your GPU as long as your PC has a PCIe slot and a good enough PSU. And even GPUs in full systems are barely affected because a $2k being 10% more expensive due to RAM is much less relevant than a 50% increase on your individual CPU upgrade.",Negative
AMD,"Well, it reduces the amount of buyers. And fewer buyers -> more stock -> lower prices. So it goes up by 10-15% due to AMD and then down due to supply.",Neutral
AMD,"Well, that is what I meant: They raise prices to compensate for the expected losses in sales. Practically speaking, they are making the retailers pay for their losses in sales volume, because CPU pricing is directly related to the RAM pricing.  Sure, that might just be $20-30 out of $600 total for your upgrade, but you'll still see an overall effect on the purchases. For a single person, it might not matter much to spend 20 bucks more, but in terms of the whole market, even small average price increases will show up in sales.  And keep in mind - Intel might be down atm, but they still exists and compete - and they'll potentially release their new architecture next year. So this is not just AMD increasing prices in a vacuum. The Ultra 235 is already contesting with 9700X and 7700X, the Ultra 225 with the 9600X and 7600X.",Neutral
AMD,"AMD isn't actually that far ahead. Non-X3D CPUs are head-to-head with Intel, if not worse in terms of value. That's just something that people aren't really talking about that much.  Intel has flown under the radar since the whole 13th/14th gen disaster, but they are far from dead. Even Apple is apparently going to produce some of their M-chips with Intel's new production process. Of course, it is hard to make any guesses of what this will actually mean for Intel's competition with AMD, but I really don't think it is as clear-cut as many people on this sub assume it is.",Neutral
AMD,"I was upset that I waited a week to get a bundle from Microcenter, and in that week they stopped including RAM in the bundles.

Median income has however only increased by 3% since 2017. So relatively speaking GPU prices have increased even more disproportionately.

As you can see, besides the flagship performance, pricing isn't actually that bad. And realistically, the flagship is of no real relevance for the typical gamer (and isn't really always comparable because flagship performance is really just what Nvidia choose it to be due to their monopoly on the high-end).  This is offtopic, though. Not even sure why I get downvoted for pointing that out.   GPU pricing is barely affected by other parts because it is the most expensive compent in like 90% of cases. If you buy a $2k build, $100-200 more sucks, but that isn't gonna change much about you having $2k to spend.  CPUs, on the other hand, are directly affected by RAM and mainboard pricing - and if RAM suddenly costs $100-200 more, then your CPU upgrade costs that much more.

Now the 5080 is more comparable to what a 1070 was back in 2017 or a 1070 in 2020.   Yeah, we're getting some real shrinkflation from Nvidia's newer cards. The 80 class is effectively extinct. The 80 Ti used to provide performance within spitting distance of the current gen 90/Titan class cards for a fraction of the price, and the regular 80s weren't far behind. There is no card in the 50 series lineup that matches either description.  The 5080 is definitely the worst 80 class card of all time. It's not meaningfully better than the 5070 Ti, and to my knowledge it's the only 80 class card that does not beat or even match the performance of the previous generation's 90/Titan class.  It is more accurate to call it a 70 class, but shit, 70 class cards as recent as 4070 Super traded blows with the 3090. You can't even say that about the 5080 and the 4090.",Neutral
AMD,"And then you look at the 1080 which is $808 MSRP with inflation but for only 10-15% performance increase instead of 50% and compare that to the 5070 Ti at $749 MSRP with 30% performance increase (over the respective 70 models). So 50 series is way better value here.  With the 5080 you also compared a release card of the 50 series to a card that released a year after the 10 series came out originally. So 1080 Ti pricing should be closer to the (now delayed) 5080/5070Ti Super, if anything.  You need to look at the overall picture. Don't just pick the data that fits your conclusion. The overall picture is: Not much has changed. Nvidia specifically has some more agency over pricing due to their AI quasi-monopoly, but for gaming, it really isn't that bad atm.",Neutral

I never claimed that at all, don't put words in my mouth.  The 50 series has some of the worst stagnation we've ever seen from a new generation. You bringing up the 5070 stat is meaningless, especially when the 5070 is only about as good as the last generation 4070 Super. It fails to even beat the 4070 Ti, when every other 70 class card before it was at least able to soundly beat the 70 Ti of the last generation.  Taking all of this into account, it's clear the utter lack of generational uplift on the 5070 is what's responsible for the 5080's growing lead. Insinuating that this is instead the result of 5080 being good value or providing good generational uplift rather than the 5070's failure to improve is completely disingenuous.  And we see this all across the 50 series' product lineup. The 5060 Ti 16 GB can't even beat the 4070, when the 3060 Ti was beating the 2080 Super. The 5060 can't even beat the 4060 Ti 8 GB, when the 3060 was beating the 2070. The 5070 Ti can at best match the 4080, when the 4070 Ti was beating the 3090.  And all this is corroborated by the [diminishing relative core count](https://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large/public/inline-images/cuda_percent_7_full-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp) to the flagship we see in these newer generations. The current 5080 has a relative core count that is comparable to what the 70 class cards of the past offered.  If we look at the 30 series (the last generation to provide generational improvements across the board, and not just for select cards), we see how bad it currently is.  The 5080 offers 50% of the 5090's core count for 50% of the price. Seems reasonable, but it becomes a shit value proposition when you consider that the 3070 offered **56%** of the 3090's core count for only **33%** of the price. For a more direct relative price comparison, the 3080 offered **83%** of the 3090's cores for **53%** of the price.  The 5070 offers 28% of the 5090's cores for 27.5% of the price. Again, seems reasonable until you consider the price to relative core ratio of the 3070 I just mentioned. To rub salt into the wound, spending **26.6%** of the 3090's MSRP would have gotten you a 3060 Ti with **46.3%** of the cores.  By relative core count, the 5080 should be a 70 class. And this translates over to performance, too. The 5080 is only 66% as fast as the 5090, while the 3070 was 70% as fast as the 3090 was. What used to be the 80 class is extinct, there's no denying it.  I really don't understand why you're going to bat so hard for Nvidia here. Unless you literally work for their PR department and are paid to do this, you gain absolutely nothing trying to justify and rationalize the diminishing returns and increasing shrinkflation we've been seeing from the consumer cards.

How am I supposed to know that you don't think a 70 class card trading blows with the prior 90 model is not good? Why even write that as a seemingly positive example then? That is just misleading.  >The 5080 is the only 80 class card to not beat or even match the previous generation's 90/Titan class. Fact.  Which means little because Nvidia is the one setting the comparison for flagship. They can release a 90 series card that is just a refresh and there is nothing you can do about it cause they are a quasi-monopoly in the high-end. Thus, flagship performance is a really bad baseline to work with. What you should set as a baseline, is the main consumer cards, i.e. 60 and 70 models (maybe add 80 for the high-end consumer), that set the baseline for hardware prerequisites - and this baseline IS actually relevant for gaming.  >The 50 series has some of the worst stagnation we've ever seen from a new generation.

The current 5080 has a relative core count that is comparable to what the 70 class cards of the past offered.  Which is even less relevant. It does not matter. Practically NOONE buys GPUs for relative core count - consumers buy it for performance. Whether Nvidia saves more money by using smaller chips or not - as long as you get the performance you need for a certain price, that is a non-argument.  >I really don't understand why you're going to bat so hard for Nvidia here.

AMD,">Why even write that as a seemingly positive example then? That is just misleading.  Because we're discussing the stagnation of the 50 series here, buddy.  >They can release a 90 series card that is just a refresh  And this is nothing more than a meaningless hypothetical. The 90 class cards are the only ones that have been consistently getting the generation to generation performance improvements, and the fact is that the rest of the lineup hasn't followed suit. Sure, if the 6090 has a performance uplift as marginal as the one from the 3090 to the 3090 Ti then your argument may have a leg to stand on. But that has not happened. Well, it did for the 5070, but that's another topic.  The 80 class used to provide similar die sizes and core counts as the 90/Titan class. It no longer does. No matter what mental gymnastics you'd like to do to justify this, you cannot deny this.  >What you should set as a baseline, is the main consumer cards, i.e. 60 and 70 models (maybe add 80 for the high-end consumer), that set the baseline for hardware prerequisites  And given the shrinking relative core counts and die sizes, it's clear that Nvidia can set these mid range tiers just as arbitrarily as they set ""the comparison for flagship"" as you say. You bring up the hypothetical that they can release a next gen 90 series card that is just a refresh. I bring up the reality that they *actually did that* for the 5070. Tell me then, why would the ""main consumer cards"" serve as a better baseline when the exact thing you claimed might happen to the 90 series actually happened to the 70 series?  If anything, your ""5070 -> 5080 = 50%"" is even more invalid than making comparisons to the flagship class, because the 70 class is a stagnant product and what your comparison is really saying is that the 5080 is only 50% faster than a 70 class card from the last generation.  >Which also means nothing because we are talking about the prices for the consumer. Whether the market stagnates or not is IRRELEVANT to the level of pricing.  It does mean something, because you are completely ignoring the aspect of value here. The 5070 being $50 less than the 4070 Super is not a particularly big win when I could have bought the 4070 Super at launch and got an entire year of usage out of it before the 5070 even came out and provided no performance uplift.  Hell, by your logic, they could have released the 5070 at $600 (making it a literal rebadge of the 4070 Super) and you would have been fine with that, and fine with comparing it to a 5080 because ""stagnation is irrelevant to pricing"". Never mind the shitty value proposition that would be.  You used to be able to spend less than a grand (even adjusted for inflation) on a 3080 and get something that was pretty much just as good as the best GPU in the world at the time. *That's* a meaningful metric for value, not comparing a 5080 to a lower tier graphics card that isn't even better than its predecessor.  >Practically NOONE buys GPUs for relative core count - consumers buy it for performance.  Well, good thing I brought up performance in my comment then! Did you have trouble seeing it? I can make it bigger so you don't miss it this time.  # The 5080 is only 66% as fast as the 5090 (at 50% the price), while the 3070 was 70% as fast as the 3090 was (at 33% the price).  That's a pretty good argument for the shitty value of the current 80 class, no?  >Whether Nvidia saves more money by using smaller chips or not - as long as you get the performance you need for a certain price, that is a non-argument.  This only matters if we can get better performance out of shrinking dies. The 4070 Super had a much smaller die than the 3090 and matched it in performance. In that case, sure, they got the same performance out of less silicon, and could justify the diminishing relative core count.  But saying it's a non argument no matter what as long as ""you get the performance you need"" is an awful argument. That is just settling for mediocrity and stagnation. By your logic, the 6070, and 7070, and 8070 could come out, be exactly the same as the 5070 for the same price, and it'd be a perfectly fine product because ""you get the performance you need"".  >that Nvidia used to be much better - And I am telling you: No, they weren't.  And how do you justify this? The hard fact is that you used to be able to buy a 70 class card that would match the flagship card of the previous generation. Or an 80 class card that would soundly beat it. Each new generation (save for a couple exceptions) offered incredible value in that sense. This one does not. You literally cannot ignore the diminishing generational improvements we have been seeing.  I'm not saying Nvidia was some great company before, but when we literally do not see the generational improvements they used to provide, how can you sit here and claim that ""they weren't better"" before? Nostalgia glasses do not tint the relative performance charts on TechPowerUp.",Negative

Just looking around real quick, this seems slightly cheaper than comparable options, so probably a little bit of a deal. Considering components, it’s not a steal by any means. You might be able to build something for less or the same price, even with crazy ram prices.  One last thing to note is that prebuilts aren’t always upgradable. I’m already thinking about upgrading my GPU when the next AMD release comes. If you can’t upgrade components easily, this build is what you’re stuck with.

Also, 3.5 is still new and these upcoming are refreshes.",Neutral
AMD,I think your guess is right. I suspect they will update their entire line with UDNA when it releases,Neutral
AMD,"Remember, the main limit for an igpu is the memory bandwidth and latency since it uses ram. Strix halo has a wider bus thus higher bandwidth, but all the others use normal lpddr5x, for example in handhelds. It might be that a rdna4 igpu isn't really faster than a 3.5 one due to this aspect alone, even if it would have nice features like fsr4. They probably are waiting for ddr6 memory to increase the bandwidth and put stronger igpus in devices, or at least this is my theory.",Neutral
AMD,This is just a refresh of the current lineup. It is heavily rumoured that Zen6 will feature more cores.,Neutral
AMD,Isn't Lunar Lake eating their iGPU lunch? I certainly hope their next arch is viable and feasible for mobile.,Neutral
AMD,LPDDR5X 10667 is in mass production and matches the introductory data rate of LPDDR6 (if we ignore 1.5X channel/ECC overhead). They can brute force GB/s issue.   Also RDNA 3.5 has many of RAM BW saving tech as so we'll see how much they actually need to push this. See C&C breakdown and LLVM post u/Defeqel.  But it's an easy win for higher end configs for sure as they're prob BW starved rn.  AMD better have FSR4 INT8 ready by 2026 because RDNA 3.5 products are going nowhere. Even standard SoCs with Medusa Point (without dGPU die) will reuse RDNA 3.5 for another gen according to Kepler\_L2. No UDNA except for premium mobile SKUs (with seperate dGPU die bolted on) it seems u/SAUCEYOLOSWAG and u/Hero_The_Zero   But it's good enough for entry level as it doesn't need ML power of RDNA 4 or GFX13 and like u/J05A3 said it's new and it'll prob be a repeat of Vega 7nm iGPU except this time even more prolonged.,Neutral
AMD,"RDNA4 introduced new compression tech, which is why it gets away with rather small bandwidth, though perhaps 3.5 already has that",Neutral
AMD,Hopefully   AMD has been on 6/8 core Ryzen 5/7 longer than Intel was on 4 cores lol,Positive
AMD,"did you forget that the x950 parts launched in 2019? sure the cheaper mainstream is still 8 cores, but Intel was selling 8 cores for $1000 until Zen. at least AMD isn't selling 16 cores for that still though I hope they increase mainstream to 32 soon.",Neutral
AMD,I did not. But did you forget that those were a different price class and basically HEDT and not really mainstream?  AMD has had the same core counts on their mainstream CPUs for almost 9 years LOL.,Neutral

Remember that if you have a 5600/5700/5800/7600/7800/9800X 3D cache CPU then the AMD 3D cache optimizer driver shouldn't be running (but it doesn't hurt anything if it's installed), it will automatically detect that the CPU is a single CCD processor and thus it won't start.",Positive

AMD,Cs2 started having weird stutters after this update. It was fine since I built the pc 2 months ago,Positive
AMD,"Looking at the changes, it doesn't appear it's needed if you are still on AM4. Maybe those bug fixes are some security mitigation, but I can live without them.",Negative
AMD,"Have the same fps or even lost 10 fps in some games? not 100% sure, but I think I lost some fps. The only thing that is better, my mouse is smoother, when moving around.",Neutral
AMD,"I updated an X570 Aorus Elite Wifi from F40i to F40 today and also installed these chipset drivers. One of those two things seems to have enabled Kernal DMA protection on Win 11, no clue which.",Neutral

AMD,Do we install it?,Neutral
AMD,Atualização Chipset 👏👏👏,Neutral
AMD,ITS STUTTERY AS HELL TEAM PLS CONFIRM,Negative
AMD,July or June,Neutral
AMD,"back in June, but some motherboard manufacturers have had newer (beta?) builds for a while now.",Neutral
AMD,">Remember that if you have a 5800/7800/9800X3D then the AMD 3D cache optimizer driver shouldn't be running (but it doesn't hurt anything if it's installed), it will automatically detect that the CPU is a single CCD processor and thus it won't start.  what does that mean? It sounds so counterintuitive. Why is there something called AMD 3d cache optimizer when I shouldn't use it with a 3d cache processor. 😭",Negative
AMD,is this cache optimizer only on win11 and not win10?,Neutral
AMD,"Ha! Suckers! Luckily, I'm too poor to upgrade from my 5950x...😭😭😭",Negative
AMD,"Wait now where does the 5600X3D fall in which is, if remembering about my CPU here, 3 cores on one CCD and 3 on the other from otherwise “defective” dies?",Neutral
AMD,Is this something I have to check on or off somewhere?  I have an 5800x3d,Neutral
AMD,I had this same issue with Adrenalin not opening and also completely breaking SteamVR with 25.11.1 on a 7900XT (even before these Chipset drivers today). I had to roll back to 25.10.2 a few weeks ago.,Negative
AMD,"I don’t have this problem question what .net and visual c++ redistributable do you have installed ? I will recommend to erase all of them and install all of them back , the .net only install the one still getting updated 8, 9, 10 and on visual c++ add version 2005 to a newer version.",Neutral
AMD,Sounds similar to WMIC where a bunch of stuff got deprecated and then later removed with 24H2/25H2.,Neutral
AMD,"I have an ASUS mobo and they have basically stopped publishing drivers for my chipset (B350). Last one was published in 2024, a few versions ago. I haven't bothered updating it since then but now I'm thinking I kinda have to since I'm on Windows 11.  If I were you I'd wait for the ASRock version, B650 is still in production, it shouldn't take that long.",Negative
AMD,It's chipset drivers. You want them to be boring...,Neutral
AMD,"Well my AM5 mobo still isn't stable on latest Windows 11, so here's hoping something got fixed for that. Cause if it does, I'd be pretty damn excited.",Positive
AMD,Ideally one would want to update to this new version regardless.,Neutral
AMD,"which version of Windows? Also, try setting a different power plan and then back to the one you were using.",Neutral
AMD,Working fine here,Positive
AMD,"Its mainly for double ccd CPUs so 9900X3D and 9950x3D, so Windows Scheduler knows which core to use in any specific ocasion.  For X800x3D chips it doesnt really matter because they are single ccd chips, so it no need to choose between both ccds.",Neutral
AMD,"It's for the dual CCD X3D processors (so the Ryzen 9 X3D models), it's supposed to help properly allocate processes to the V-cache CCD. So for the single CCD models (Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5), it's not needed.",Neutral
AMD,If memory serves it is for the dual CCD chips like the 9950X3D and its purpose is just to try and make sure tasks that benefit from the 3D vcache run on the CCD with the vcache. You don't need it on the 8 core chips as they are single CCD so all tasks will be on the 3d vcache regardless.,Neutral
AMD,No your cpu is just a 5800x3D with 2 cores fused off. None of the CPUs in zen 3 lineup barring the 12 and the 16 core models are on dual ccds,Neutral
AMD,That bug(for me at least) was because of the internal gpu my 7700x has. Disabling that one and leaving only my 9060 XT running solved my issue of the software not launching. Does your cpu have an internal gpu?,Negative
AMD,"Thanks for the suggestion, how do I check those versions? I just installed Windows11 Pro from scratch a week ago and made all WU updates.",Neutral
AMD,You should be downloading your chipset drivers from amds site.,Neutral
AMD,"You ""executing"" the Chipset Software update unpacks all the packages to   C:\\AMD\\Chipset\_Software  if you are curious about Release Notes or README, just take a look yourself inside \\Packages or \\Logs  to see what got updated on your machine.   if you are **really** curious, read the relevant .inf and check the .sys/.cat",Neutral
AMD,It's more of a commentary on the lack of detail. AM4 or AM5 bug fixes? Specific bug fixes? What components of 25H2 are now officially supported?,Neutral
AMD,Good point!,Positive
AMD,Yep I do have an internal GPU but cannot disable it as I have displays running off it as well. Good to know though.,Positive
AMD,"On windows go to app, installed apps  and you will find them there. To find them go to web search  and look for .net and the Microsoft page will pop up get in I think it will send you to version 10 but the saw square small letters you will see one that says all .net version click and on every version only download.net desktop runtime x64 and x86  and install. For the other one search visual c++ and look for techpowerup it will download all in one folder open it look for install and let it install all of them at the same time.",Neutral
AMD,Correct. I assume that some users might confuse chipset driver updates with bios firmware updates.,Neutral
AMD,"Okay, I was under the assumption that chipset drivers from the manufacturer were sometimes tailored to the specific board, or at the very least verified to work without issues, while the AMD drivers were more generic. Perhaps that info is outdated nowadays. Regardless, I've never had any issues with the drivers from ASUS site.",Neutral
AMD,"The Google method. Copy and paste ""Bug fixes and minor improvements"" and call it a day.",Neutral
AMD,"These were the highlights.    Going down the page, in the ""Package Contents"" section there is a change detail for each driver.",Neutral
AMD,"I do the same because it drops memory power consumption on my 7950xtx, since the card is only driving the one monitor.  Good to know that this bug is what is causing at least one game to not launch and the software to not open.",Negative
AMD,If anyone is confusing chipset drivers with bios updates i would have bigger concerns about what they are doing.,Neutral
AMD,"There maybe components on the board that maybe different like intel nic vs realtek which require their own drivers.  However chipsets no.  Asus , msi, asrock, gigabyte will all use the same chipset drivers.",Neutral
AMD,"It's the same thing. 25H2 and bugfixes, plus new hw support",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, I'm talking chipset indeed, this is the latest in my asrock b650: AMD chipset driver ver:7.06.24.2226, it's the same since august.",Neutral
AMD,"I see. I wonder why the version numbers always differ from the AMD drivers, if it's just the exact same driver?",Neutral
AMD,"> Asus , msi, asrock, gigabyte will all use the same chipset drivers.  thanks for info",Neutral
AMD,"From r/radeon   * Ray Caching: Only available in Warhammer40K today, more games next year. * Ray Reconstruction: Only available in Black Ops 7 today with more games next year. * AI Frame Gen: Available in Black Ops 7 today with 40 games by end of 2025.",Neutral
AMD,It's almost 2026 and AMD keeps reinstalling the AMD Install Manager that I do not want and have to keep manually uninstalling. Stop this AMD.,Negative
AMD,What is fsr redstone? and which games use it?,Neutral
AMD,"I got a notification for the update in AMD Adrenalin Edition, but it does not appear in the actual install manager lol",Neutral
AMD,<--- Int8 rdna2 enjoyer,Neutral
AMD,so can I open adrenalin on this one with a rdna 2 igpu and rdna3 gpu or is it still broken like the last version,Neutral
AMD,So we cant test path tracing performance yet on Cyberpunk? Lol,Neutral
AMD,did they fix enhanced sync and noise suppression yet,Neutral
AMD,"The ignorance by amd of Rx 7000 users is astounding tbh, but this is 2025 AMD not prior AMD where they would try to appease a larger user base.  It's going to make me rethink my loyalty for future gfx purchases",Negative
AMD,Did this driver fix purple visual glitches with the RX 7700 XT? It's a known bug that appeared after the driver 25.4.1,Neutral
AMD,"The adrenalin app just auto updated my 9070xt mid game, now my screen is black with no signal output to my monitor but my music is still playing lol. I waited for 10mins then I had to hard restart my computer for it to say the update failed",Negative
AMD,So is there any point to installing this if I'm on RDNA2 and don't have any of the issues that they fixed?,Negative
AMD,Is this worth updating to from 25.11.1  Is it more stable?,Neutral
AMD,I just tested the release on four machines (76X&78XT/78X3D&79XTX/97X&9070XT/75F&76XT). Every system still suffers from crashing drivers when hardware-accelerated apps are used (Chrome/Discord/etc.).  Please fix. :),Negative
AMD,Pretty dissapointing ngl,Neutral
AMD,Nothing on Oblivion Remastered crashing? Intermittent application crash or driver timeout on 9000 series when playing Battlefield 6?,Negative
AMD,"Is it safe to update, 25.9.1 is stable for my 9070XT and causes zero crashes with the timeout bullshit from clock speeds going to 3300+ MHz",Neutral
AMD,This is the worst driver amd made 9060xt for me. 2 games instantly crashes. Indiana jones and silent hill 2. With this driver if you enable ray tracing game hangs and give error.i already report bugs in 25.12.1 and same with 25.11.1 and amd does nothing. every ray tracing titles works ok with 25.10.1 driver and this is bad. amd does not listen users anymore. anyone has any crashes happen like me?thanks...,Negative

AMD,hardware unboxed tested it and frame facing is broken when amd frame gen is on sadly,Negative
AMD,"Is this driver more stable than 25.11.1 it was causing driver time outs and i even got a blue screen. I rolled back to 25.9,2 and now im scared to update to this one lol",Negative
AMD,Please add the broken noise suppression to “Known Issues”.,Neutral
AMD,New update new problems,Positive
AMD,"This is a very underwhelming update for RDNA 4 users I get that this technology needs to mature, but they should already be at a point where the implementation is across more wide array of games. My fallen RDNA 2 and RDNA 3 brothers will be remembered. The only reason AMD gpus are still relevant rn is price, nvidia tax is crazy. GG",Negative
AMD,"Can confirm on my 9060XT that Silent Hill 2 is still crashing and Avatar Frontiers of Pandora currently has a bug when FSR4 is enabled where the entire screen starts flashing like a strobe light, shadowy areas seem to trigger it. This is with both games fully patched & up to date.",Negative
AMD,These comments are all over the place is it better than 25.11.1 or not? 😂😂,Negative
AMD,"Still enjoying the piss out of the 7900XTX on 25.9.2. It chews through everything I throw at it at the settings I choose, don't care about new driver releases unless a new game I want to play doesn't play well on whatever driver I currently have installed.",Negative
AMD,"Guys calm down. RDNA3 being moved to maintenance mode is part of their new strategy, no longer ""Fine Wine"", the new approach is Stale Ale. That way their products remain DOA after launch and people won't keep them very long.",Neutral
AMD,"I had to downgrade to 25.9.1 to have some level of stability, can somebody confirm that the new driver is safe to upgrade to without it messing stuff up?",Neutral
AMD,Still no fsr 4 support for rdna3 🙄,Negative
AMD,Did they fixed the amd noise supression not turning on?,Neutral
AMD,"Anyone know why Cronos: The New Dawn has been showing [""FSR 4""](https://i.ibb.co/nqW2VMng/Cronos-The-New-Dawn-2025-12-04-02-28.png) for me on a 7900 XT for a few weeks? At first it was 3.1.

AMD,"Let me see - all the new ""Features"" will be available for Cyberpunk 2077 in at least 1 year time and ONLY with RDNA4 ??",Neutral
AMD,"I thought the application freeze fix might have stopped monster hunter wilds from crashing on me but nope still does it (DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED,)",Negative
AMD,I hope this fixes the many crashes I've had since the last update...,Negative
AMD,"Even tho I have a 9070xt this is still so underwhelming… We waited 6 months and got basically nothing yet. Sorry for all rdna2, 3 users.  Fun fact: Its been years now that the adrenaline software cant be opened, the only fix ist to press win+p and select only main monitor. Than start it, than swap monitor profile again…   Definetly buying nvidia next time, not supporting this big company anymore, which is behind in every aspect. Image you just want to play alan wake 2 (looks beautiful).",Negative
AMD,"ass. no support for rdna2/3, no new features for rdna2/3, rdna4 have only one game that support all of that, redstone framegen almost identical to 3.1 framegen, frame pacing still there.",Negative

AMD,idk why I find it so funny that a specific Roblox game got called out in the patch notes,Negative
AMD,Any news on fixing the gpu vram leak issue on bf6? Sorry I’m lazing not reading the patch notes,Negative
AMD,So now driver frame gen is gone? Unless the game specifically supports it? And the overlay as well? Both are completely gone now after the update...,Negative
AMD,What about the fixes for the 7900xtx crashing all the time?,Negative
AMD,25.12.1 does not even install on my Minipc (780M) + 6650XT eGPU Setup.   I thought I might fix 25.11.X not opening in an eGPU Setup.   Guess I will be running 25.9.2 for another few Months.  God why something always break? I thought it would be better going all AMD for the eGPU setup.,Negative
AMD,"If  this driver update keeps crashing my gpu im not leaving 25.9.2 for a while, im also starting to think about selling my gpu and get nvidea, and really black ops 7 why not a real game like cyberpunk i dont want to waste 70 euro for fifa with guns",Negative
AMD,"Yeah I'll still be with 25.9.1 until the texture flickering is fixed in BF6, also instant replay just didn't work in 25.11.1 for me.",Negative

AMD,AMD NoiseSuppresion still broken. Since September!,Negative
AMD,so no fsr4 support on Vulcan still? this is getting ridiculous,Negative

AMD,For Sale: 7900 XTX - $50 OBO  I know these are no longer desirable due to being left in the dust by AMD after only a few months of real support but hopefully it will be at least a good paper weight for someone.,Neutral

AMD,It took a while for DLSS 4 to get implemented in a good way on 40 series cards too but a version made it there. Give it time. Now if they can just start prodding developers to incorporate that as well it’ll be worth it. Not enough games yet but here’s hoping!,Positive

AMD,I was really hoping AMD would implement Multi-Frame Generation because that is a great feature from Nvidia. I only play a few games with m+k so the latency doesn't bother me. The 9070 XT is a beast otherwise but the features are lacking in so many games. Also the ability to just upgrade fsr like DLSS override would be great too. Then we aren't dependent on the developer to implement the feature in older titles that lack fsr 3.1 or native fsr4 support. Take Alan Wake 2 for instance. It's still on FSR2 and really looks bad.,Positive
AMD,What a peace of trash. Fsr 4 quality looks dogshit,Negative
AMD,"Here’s the thing. You either need to address the FSR4/Redstone on RDNA 3 issue with a time frame or I’m just going to refund all my boxed RDNA 4 gpu’s, melt down my XTX’s, and go back to buying Nvidia cards because they’re better in everything but COD (which sucks).

AMD,"I can't speak on enhanced sync, but noise suppression is still busted and not working =/",Negative
AMD,Ok I thought I was the only one having the enhanced sync issue because no one replied to any of my posts about it. I use it because then I can lock my fps to 120 (on a 4K OLED TV) and use enhanced sync instead of Vsync because of the screen tearing when locking to 120. Now I have to do the frame lock to 117 which is fine but just annoying me I'm missing out on 3 fps lol it was causing issues in a few games where it would stutter like crazy and it all came down to enhanced sync. I don't use noise suppression so I don't know what's up with that.,Negative

AMD,"AMD stopped giving a shit about it's fans once the company was saved and they started raking in the money. The change in tone was clear as day. That said, I'll still buy their GPUs because I hate Nvidia far more and I don't see that changing.",Negative
AMD,looking back rn i think it wasnt worth the 100 dollars gain i gotwhen my 7900xt does consume more than rtx 4070ti and i do have shit features even the antilag+ scam that was one of the main reason i bought the GPU isnt here anymore .,Negative
AMD,"Mind explaining how AMD is being ignorant towards RDNA 3 users? They stated from the get go that RDNA 3 would not support FSR 4 right away due to the fact that it is hardware based and not software-based like FSR 3 and older, and that they might port it to RDNA 3 down the road if they can ensure performance doesn't tank. They never said they would definitively port FSR 4 to RDNA 3. Aside from that, RDNA 3 has been getting support for new Vulkan extensions and all the other driver-level features and optimizations. They've barely added any new features to the driver in recent months anyways aside from things related to FSR 4 and FSR Redstone so we're not missing anything of value anyways unless you really care that much about upscaling and RT. I don't use FSR or any sort of upscaling technology anyways; I'd rather drop my settings down to High or Med if I have to to ensure high frame rates without upscaling.",Neutral
AMD,"Been using it for a few hours with the 7900XTX, so far so good.   Hopefully it's 100% fixed.",Positive
AMD,I hope they fixed it. I will test it now,Positive
AMD,"Did the typical test that I usually do and it didn't show up for me and I'm on the RX 7700XT as well. So hopefully, it's fixed.",Neutral
AMD,"I had the same thing, but turns out my ram overclock was unstable (ive got 4x16gb @ 6000cl36)",Neutral
AMD,"Nope. Generally if the driver does not massively increases performance in some game, or you don't have any issues or the issue you have isn't fixed, then it's not worth updating, unless there is some new feature you want.    I reverted back to 25.9.1 (from the top of my head) because with any newer driver BF6 crashes randomly, and neither DICE nor AMD seem to give a damn about it.    And before someone asks, I tried any other fix on the internet for Battlefield and nothing else worked.",Negative

AMD,"I think Linux developers are doing some experiments As of now, FSR 4 (FidelityFX Super Resolution 4) does not officially support RDNA 2 or RDNA 3 GPUs, even on Linux. However, thanks to Develer’s work on VKD3D-Proton 3.0, there is partial and unofficial support for RDNA 3 under specific conditions.  RDNA 3: Partial Support via Develer’s VKD3D-Proton  - Develer’s VKD3D-Proton 3.0 includes support for FP8 (8-bit floating point), which is required for FSR 4. - This means RDNA 3 GPUs (like RX 7600, 7900 XT/XTX) can run FSR 4 in some games via Proton, even though AMD doesn’t officially enable it. - Global override toggles in AMD’s 25.9.1 driver can bypass the FSR 4 whitelist, allowing it to run in FSR 3.1-compatible games.  I hope they succed it will be a slap in the face.",Neutral

AMD,"They repeatedly stated, Redstone is RDNA4 exclusive. Not sure what else you expected.",Neutral
AMD,"Your best case is your RX 7900 turning into Balsamico, whatever that means.",Positive
AMD,"Its because RDNA 4 added hardware that 3 and 2 don't have. Now before I get kicked to death by angry people, there is a version of FSR Redstone that uses and INT8 path that is compatible and will work on 2 and 3, however that has not been launched today and AMD have not confirmed it will be.   That isn't to say they won't do it, but right now it's not been announced. Perhaps there will be enough noise to get AMD to change their mind or it might be that they want to get it out on their latest cards first before complicating matters with older RDNA support.  Only time will tell",Neutral

AMD,What about a secondhand 5070ti?,Neutral
AMD,"I’d wait on 5080ti with more VRAM but these are going to be obscenely expensive knowing nvidia + current RAM prices. Both 5070ti or 5080 are more of a sidegrade than upgrade, not worth the hassle IMO.",Negative
AMD,Get a 5070ti. I never thought I would say that. But this is what is is.. 9 months after release and the drivers are still D.S.,Negative
AMD,"I mean, I wouldn't get either. 5070 TI is a sidegrade from the XTX, and 5080 is only slightly better. DLSS and RT would be the only reason.",Neutral

Is Nvidia a gang of greedy fucks? Sure. But at least the bullshit’s right out front where you can get a good strong whiff of it. You know what you’re in for.",Negative
AMD,"I had Nvidia for years, the main reason I switched was that the drivers went to shit last year. I'm just sick of them in general, too. The 7800 XT I bought has been one of the most trouble free cards I ever had, aside from Adrenalin randomly closing in certain versions.",Negative
AMD,"How exactly does NVIDIA have better features than AMD? Aside from upscaling and ray-tracing related features (I turn off ray tracing anyways because it is additional eye candy that I just don't care about), NVIDIA relies almost entirely on DLSS and DLAA for any sort of performance improvements; their raw rasterization barely outperforms AMD until you go to the 5080 and above and even then the overall performance increase is negligible. And we all know how NVIDIA absolutely messed up their drivers with the 50 series when it first came out. And GPUs like the RX 7900 XTX still out-class the RTX 5080 in the VRAM department, and VRAM is becoming increasingly relevant as games demand more and more resources out of a PC. The only GPU that surpasses the 7900 XTX in VRAM is the RTX 5090 with its 32GB of VRAM, but that is an insanely expensive GPU that is literally in its own price class.  AMD doesn't have the financial resources or the budget in their graphics department to support older GPUS for as long as NVIDIA, because of their overall lower market share compared to them. NVIDIA got away with supporting architectures like Pascal and Maxwell for as long as they did because they had the user base to warrant it. AMD doesn't, so why would they continue investing budgetary/financial expenditures and labour hours into older architectures if the user base of these GPUs is small? But I feel like you and AlienIsGOD have a fundamental misunderstanding as to how GPU driver support works; they marketed FSR 4 as being exclusive to the RX 9000 series due to its hardware acceleration, aside from that RDNA 3 has still been getting new features incl. additional support for new Vulkan extensions.  However, AMD supported Polaris for quite a while even with the budget that they did in their graphics division, until version 25.8.1 of the Adrenalin driver released back in August, which means they supported it for almost a decade, and in fact they almost supported it for as long as NVIDIA did with Pascal (Pascal support was finally dropped with the most recent NVIDIA driver). And RDNA 1/2 are still supported as well.  Just because AMD hasn't been releasing new driver features on these older architectures doesn't mean AMD doesn't support their architectures; your take represents a fundamental misunderstanding as to how driver support works.",Neutral

AMD,"performance wise it should only be a couple frames of latency, when doing rendering on dgpu and going out through igpu it'll just copy over the frame buffers.   Main impact is on pcie bandwidth as it'll use up quite a lot there, and to a smaller degree RAM load, so you definitely don't want to run some other dynamic load on the igpu when gaming to overwhelm its pcie link.

AMD,6800XT.,Neutral
AMD,Some of their marketing said they would like to get it working if possible.,Neutral
AMD,overhead is too big and not worth it.,Negative
AMD,"All the marketing was clear on Redstone being RX 9000 only. Expecting any other result, is you thinking a corporation (especially one notorious for lying and deceiving) can be honest.

AMD,Sounds like an issue specific to your system.  What troubleshooting have you done?,Neutral
AMD,I never seen 1 crash on 25.11.1 although I did use the preview update for windows 11 last week which fixed some amd gpu related crashing and that solved my arc raiders random crashing,Neutral
AMD,"Also it's considered pretty poor Raytracing. People are usually snobbs who go ""I can't tell the difference"" when it comes to raytracing as a coping mechanism but darktide is the one game I can see why, it's not very noticeable and not worth it.",Negative
AMD,"yes, 3.1 is where AMD adopted the same modular approach as nvidia so any game at fsr 3.1 or above just runs at whatever latest fsr version your driver supports, which is currently 4 although now the versions aren't numbered anymore",Neutral
AMD,Hell yeah 👍🏻   Impressive you can run that on a 5x86,Positive

AMD,"If you're fine with it, that's cool and that's your right. No problems with that at all. I hope it at least helps you out and does what you ask if you use it.  I am not and I don't want it. I'm tired of companies throwing shit ware on my PC, then when I remove it, they put it right back. Who are they to override my decisions on my own paid for property?  I dislike automatic updaters and 'additional installers' of any kind. How many bad updates get pushed through that end up adding problems or even worse, destroying data. In the case of drivers, how many drivers that come through that end up causing issues. It's why a lot of people use older drivers that they know that works.   But that's all honestly irrelevant. It's my fucking computer and that's all there is to it. It doesn't belong to them or any other company.  It's why I don't primarily run Windows anymore.

AMD,"Seems to be working fine, though when I was installing the driver my igpu showed up separately from the dgpu in the installer with a download link. But when re-running it they both show under 25.12.1  Should I be installing some separate older driver for it to keep things like hw accel working or was that just some hiccup?",Neutral

AMD,"Also from what I can tell, enhanced sync is fixed at least on my end.",Positive
AMD,"I had a similar issue with my 6800xt and the other thing that helped was to sit it to fullscreen or borderless and swap back and forth. Now I'm only playing in fullscreen (which is annoying), but it doesnt crash anymore.",Neutral
AMD,"And it is, and they did, we have the leaked int8 version from September... Just needs official driver implementation now.",Neutral
AMD,"That is literally demonstrably false. Users are already implementing the leaked FSR 4 INT8 version and happy with the image quality improvement, even if it results in a smaller fps bump.",Neutral
AMD,Why not make it optional and let users decide? Like nvidia did for dlss trasformer model on older gpus..,Neutral
AMD,Real world results in the Int8 show otherwise. Works great on the 7900 XTX.,Positive
AMD,"It's still the full version. It's just processing through INT8 rather than FP8. Slightly less efficient method, but same algorithm.",Neutral
AMD,Exactly.  So you agree they just decide not to.,Neutral

AMD,Ive had zero crashes for 2 weeks on arc due to the preview update which rolled out to the public this week. You could try underclocking your gpu if it boosts over the limit.,Positive
AMD,"No one cares about new drivers. It's a big ""reveal/release"" date. Hype and sh\*t. And the only one who is celebrating is RDNA4 users (even though there is not much to celebrate). DLSS4 can be used by even 2000 series rtx cards, but we are f\*\*\*ing stuck with f\*\*\*ing trash. Even competitors upscaler (XESS) is more viable for amd rdna2/3 users which is nuts.

AMD,Everything,Neutral
AMD,"Depends on where you look at it.

AMD,"Ah, you're one of *those*.   Life's a lot better when you cease giving a fuck about all of that nonsense.   Weirdly, my PC just works, and I don't have to fuck with it like ever.  I have no idea how you people are having so many problems with your computers to be like this.",Positive
AMD,Well look at the scenario implied. Piling up tons of startup apps is going to have a small impact on a bench testing score. Those synthetic tests dont necessarily translate into a big FPS loss.,Negative
AMD,"Having tons of useless services constantly pinging and invalidating cache, in fact, sucks.",Negative
AMD,"Maybe 1-10 points in Cinebench. It's impossible to ""not run anything in the background"" because there's always 1000 things running in the background whether you want them to or not.

AMD,"Thank you for the idea, I just tried a custom install during an update, was given 2 choices (update/dont update driver and install/dont install privacy view). After installing drivers, step 2/2 was installing the install manager.    After updating through adrenaline using the custom option, I attempted reinstalling again using the auto-detect, custom install. I was given the option of install/dont install privacy view. The driver choice was not selectable and it reinstalled the install manager during step 2/2.   Installing via the WHQL package, custom install follows the same steps as above. I was given the option of install/dont install privacy view. The driver choice was not selectable and it reinstalled the install manager during step 2/2.",Neutral

AMD,Nvm the issue I was having just happened in Resident Evil 2 Remake.,Neutral
AMD,"There might be legal hurdles.  The performance cost of the INT8 model is also extremely high, particularly for lower-end devices like integrated graphics. If a game is running at 250 fps (4 ms per frame) for example, and the INT8 model costs 3 ms to execute, that would require the lower resolution to run at 1000 fps (1 ms) before the INT8 model was effectively net zero in performance.",Negative
AMD,"but the overhead is still high. On a 35-40fps game, I'm not sure activating FSR4 with INT8 will be worth it. They are probably still working on reducing this overhead before implementing it with Steam Machine.  They should focus on releasing the whole suite of Redstone before looking at older hardware. Heck, one out of 4 ""product/feature"" they just announce is not even available for the 9000 series.",Negative

AMD,"You have to understand the hardware implementations instead of just getting mad about it. AMD took a different approach with RDNA2, evolved it again on RDNA3, and then straight up went for AI cores that have more parity with Nvidia's approach. Intel also had a more AI core centric approach with XeSS, so you can fairly criticize the decision making along the way for sure, but Nvidia has even began paywalling off what features in DLSS are available on each respective generation, with some other broad improvements being available. In essence, you can be just as mad at them for not even offering multiframe gen prior to 3000 series, and 2000 series will never see 4x multi-frame either. There are always trade-offs.",Neutral

AMD,"there won't be an ""fsr 5"" because any game with fsr implemented from here on out should, in theory, be compatible with every future version of fsr made, so numbering them isn't as meaningful. they're probably just going to stick with unofficial codenames like redstone for diffrentiation. Nvidia still uses versioning for DLSS despite it using the same system because it's good for marketing and diffrentiation so I'm not sure that dumping the version numbers is a wise decision but it also makes sense",Neutral

AMD,"Possibly, but what I meant it's that it can't be an excuse as we have a similar example. If they can manage to do it, it will be great for users.

AMD,"There might be code or training data for which AMD lacks the appropriate rights. There might also be changes in the driver causing issues, seeing as FSR4 INT8 only works on RDNA2 with very old drivers, which might introduce new problems.  The performance cost doesn't make sense to measure in percentages. Upscaling costs some amount of time per frame, the costs are related to input resolution and output resolution as well as GPU performance. This is significant, because it means the performance benefit from upscaling is inversely proportional to the base framerate.  [Here's a test from a 6600XT](https://youtu.be/c3YWjqpQu-U?si=siE49iTbmtEU2K06). FSR3 costs \~0.80 ms, XeSS costs \~1.60 ms, and FSR4 INT8 costs \~2.30 ms. That's from 1280x720 to 1920x1080.   If you're at 5 ms render time at 1920x1080, and dropping the resolution to 1280x720 reduces the render time to 3 ms, then you will see total frametime with FSR4 INT8 Quality go from 5 ms to 5.3 ms, or 200 fps to 189 fps. This is not easy for people to understand.  Consider how someone with a Radeon 660M might be interested in trying some game with upscaling. Since they aren't technically inclined, they enable every performance-related option in the driver, including FSR4 INT8. Instead of FSR3.1 eating up 5 ms to upscale from 1280x720 to 1920x1080, they're now looking at 15 ms for FSR4 INT8!",Neutral
AMD,"its not worth it at low fps, there's a 2.3ms overhead.  if you play at 60fps (16.6ms) at 1080p. You lower your internal res with this FSR4 version and gain 30% performance. now you are at 78fps (12.8ms). Now add this 2.3ms cost, we are back to 66fps.",Negative
AMD,"I mean I would be pretty annoyed if I could enable something that caused issues because the hardware I have couldn’t support it   Whilst some of us have zero issues with tinkering with stuff, they also have to account for those who can’t and just want to play without messing with settings too much",Negative

RDNA2 fares worse for obvious reasons (lacks WMNA), in AI workloads RDNA 3 is quite a bit faster than RDNA 2. Also a 6600xt is just a weak GPU.   FSR4 should come to RDNA3, it works well on it. The 7900 XTX gets pretty close to 9700 XT performance in FSR 4 through INT8 (matches it in some cases).  RDNA2 is quite a bit older, weaker, and lacks WMNA, it's understandable if it doesn't get FSR4. Really no good excuse for RNDA3.",Neutral

I thought I was switching to the “good guys” who cared about consumer value with the vram and price performance vs nvidia’s cards at the time, minus dlss…but as reports and constant articles/gamers nexus videos has shown, both major graphics companies just don’t give a flying motherfuck about us.

Now that AMD built a card that does what Nvidia does, with the software that uses that hardware to full effect, you finally feel let down by the whole thing.

AMD,Welcome to AMD.   6000 owners got moved to legacy drivers without future game optimizations.    And people wonder why Nvidia is dominating when 'nobody cares about ray tracing or DLSS'.    People care about not being screwed over on their $1000 GPUs.,Negative
AMD,"I bought 7000 series just 11 months ago and regret my decision.  Once the sale is done, they ditch you.  It's the first AMD card I've had since the early 2000s.  I don't hate the card but it's not a very good value.",Negative
AMD,"The cards don't have the hardware to run them at their full potential without significant performance loss. It's why buying an AMD card pre-9000 series was always suspect; the feature gap to Nvidia was too big.      Now it's been at least partially closed, but people expect old GPUs to also catch up? That's not how it works.",Negative
AMD,"There's dedicated hardware in the 9000 series to handle these features, that's what they're designed for.   People who bought a 7000 series years ago already accepted that they preferred the higher raster performance and memory spec in comparison to Nvidia's use of computational upscaling and ray tracing through hardware acceleration.  But now that AMD specced the 9000 series with computational upscaling and hardware accelerated ray tracing, AMD users somehow feel let down that their 7000 series Radeons that were never designed for this aren't doing the same things through software updates.  The 7000 series was a disappointment at release because of its reliance on traditional rasterisation. It's not only just now becoming a disappointment because AMD isn't adding features that the GPUs were not designed for.",Neutral

AMD,"Yeah, this has been my main grievance with people complaining about FSR 4 being 9000 only (at least the fp8 version)  Everyone points out that Nvidia still supports the rtx 2000 series with dlss updates, but when it first came out it didn't support the gtx series. What's different here with AMD? FSR 3 works fine on previous gpus, and at least that exists. Gtx users had nothing until AMD came along to fill what dlss left empty.

I'm just curious because I upgraded from an RX480 to a 9060 XT over the summer, but at no point before that did I ever feel like I needed an upgrade. The only reason I did upgrade is because I wanted to play Spider-man 2 and it wasn't supported and crashed during the first cutscene before you even get control (annoyingly, the RX580 was the oldest AMD card to get an update for SM2, despite the RX480 having very similar specs even while being a generation older).",Neutral

AMD,Its especially infuriating as they don’t offer an upgrade path for 6950xt and 7900xt(x) owners… iirc the 9070 is about on par with the 6950xt so it doesn’t make sense to upgrade for any of the high end GPU owners.

AMD,Lossless Scaling is not the same as FSR4 or DLSS......,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, but it looks so much better than FSR3 that you can run it at lower settings to make up for the performance penalty.

I was testing Darktide with RT and all settings on ultra, running at \~164fps (locked) on Performance, saw one benchmark of a 9070xt with same settings and resolution, and it had similar framerate as mine.

AMD,"Not even a cutback version, the full fat fp8 model runs fairly well on the 7800xt and up on Linux using the latest Mesa. There isn't some special sauce magic hardware in RDNA4 for ML it's just that it supports FP8 natively without needing to be shimmed into FP16.",Neutral
AMD,"But nobody actually bought it for these reasons unless they did zero research. Literally everyone was saying including reviewers that 'I don't care about RT, it's good for raster' and now the RT and upscaling is good suddenly people cry over not having it. Nah you had a cheaper card for raster, that was the choice you made.",Negative
AMD,Issue being that some games just dont work with this. Take a look at AMDs timeline and it becomes kind of obvious why Int8 hasnt been released.,Negative
AMD,Because it's not ready? When people have forced it on those cards it works but it gives zero performance improvements so you're just fucking the image quality for no reason. But people see that and think AMD is holding it back for no reason at all.,Negative
AMD,"Personally, I'm happy with using the leaked FSR4 Int8 version with my 7900 XTX until UDNA comes out. It works great. The manual part of things is kinda janky, but people needed to do that with official FSR4 for some titles as well. I do think people need to consider that a card released in 2022 is still among the best cards out right now excluding Nvidia's 4090/5090, and that's impressive. The air of secrecy from AMD doesn't help brand loyalty but at the end of the day, Nvidia and AMD only care about shareholders and future profits like any big corporation.",Positive

FSR4 works on RDNA2, AMD just wants to lock it out just like Zen3 on B350/B450 motherboards.  So the difference is that it wont work due to hardware missing vs it wont work cuz they are lazy.  Well I hope that FineWine will make the 7900XTX truly shine in a few years just like how it made the FX8350 or R7 1700 destroy Intel.",Neutral

AMD,"That's not true, RTX 2000 series still gets pretty good support despite being released in 2018. It doesn't have frame gen, but you still get DLSS and ray reconstruction. Whereas, RDNA 1,2 and 3 cards don't get access to FSR 4 and Redstone. RDNA 3 was just released over 2 years ago and it's already obsolete.  Fine wine no longer applies to AMD, hasn't been in years, it's fine milk now. Fine wine title goes to Nvidia. And I hate saying this because I really want AMD to be competitive.

AMD,"whoa I had the 6950xt it is not on par with the 9070XT, rdna4 is a different animal",Neutral
AMD,the 6950 XT is equivalent to the 7900 GRE in power. The 9070 is 20% more powerful. The 9070 XT would be 40% more so.  They didnt stop optimization. There was a whole debacle but it was clleared up a while back. Both driver branches receive game optimizations.,Neutral
AMD,"Exactly why I went from 7900xt to 5070ti. Also adrenaline was getting annoying forgetting settings, I would get constant blue screens, it would call games random things.   Not gonna lie the peace of mind I have right now with Nvidia is worth that extra $150 in MSRP. Even tho 9070xt was the same price when I bought it. Game ready updates, game list always updated, dlss looks amazing. There are stuff I haven't done, but I knowing I can path trace, or do something with AI is cool.

AMD,"yeah, so what? the hardware allows nv to better implement stuff that relies on their cuda cores which the older amd doesn´t have. what´s the gain in porting stuff to hardware that can´t run it, anyways?  as i see it, my 6900xt is still a good card. at that time (march 2021), i could have bought a 3080 with 10gb ram for roughly 300$ more alternatively. the 6900xt is still a bit faster in most games from around that time, has more ram and was way cheaper.  i honestly don´t care for ""support"", the card is now almost 5 years old, all games i play do run. and, maybe in opposition to most crybabies here, i knew the card was technically behind nV when i bought it. nV brought the second generation of RT cards, and amd presented the first gen that could at least compute RTs, but not on a playable fps rate.   you know what: take a look at the situation in one year, how many ppl boast to still use a rtx 2 or 3 series card in modern games, and then we´ll talk again. because IF that ""support"" is so powerful, there is no need to get another gpu.",Neutral
AMD,"This argument falls a little flat when you consider game development trends over the last 3 years, studios are releasing games where upscaling is non-optional, they lean on these technologies to even hit 60 fps and trying to run native is a joke. Now you want to chastise people for not predicting the future on how studios would use this as a crutch, or not predicting how good the models would eventually get. If you were buying a TOTL card in 22/23 then it was harder to make an informed decision on raster vs AI acceleration than it is now, it is much clearer today the direction the industry is going.",Negative
AMD,"Very valid point. Keep in mind though FSR4 didn't work with a bunch of games right away even with the official release. AMD could always just release a list of games that are officially supported, supported with manual effort, and all others assumed to be unsupported.

Nvidia is also pushing 7-11yrs for game ready driver support, AMD is 0-5yrs depending on if you got screwed buying a VEGA iGPU laptop or RDNA2 handheld like the base model Ryzen Z2A Xbox Ally.  Saying ""both sides"" is just cope.",Neutral
AMD,"Simply by planning ahead and investing on upscaling hardware and software, they manage to support newer updates for way older cards. AMD on the other hand, is just playing catch up to that while leaving their entire past generation GPUs behind. Whether better or not, it just doesn't make too much sense to buy AMD if you're going with a GPU with similar performance on a similar price range right now. Nvidia did the same at the time, and was rightfully criticized for it. Now it's AMD's time.",Neutral
AMD,They got better upscaling consistently across the board.,Positive
AMD,"Just MFG, which is just a cool feature most people hardly use in real world applications due to it’s image quality issues in a lot of games. They put the important things like transformer upscaling and ray reconstruction on the oldest RTX gpus still.  AMD finally gets to the level where they can finally compete with the already 3 years old DLSS 3 and they think they can pull this kind of shit.",Positive
AMD,Does it happen on 50 series?,Neutral
AMD,Not great. I run xess instead lol,Negative
AMD,"I think there is a place for it, the issue therein lies with developers and publishers that use it as free ""optimization"". For example I really like DLAA for anti aliasing as it doesn't have nearly the artifacts normal DLSS has and looks boat loads better than that forced TAA shit so many games have (I'd rather have jaggies tbh).  Frame gen is okay by me again if I'm already getting over 120 frames, I can use it to get closer to my monitors 240hz.   DLSS (for those who are fine with the artifacting) is great for upscaling from 1440p to 4k and keeping the framerate higher.  It just needs to stop being used as a crutch for games that don't push graphical fidelity (looking at you Borderlands 4).",Positive
AMD,So why does it still look worse than older games with it activated?,Negative
AMD,"I'm not blaming AMD for hardware limitations but I do think they deserve some criticism for how long they waited to get on board with this stuff and of how sudden and jarring the shift in strategy was from one gen to the next. I sympathize with the consumer because these are expensive products, and because making an informed purchase for PC hardware takes a lot more research than stuff you buy for most hobbies. I feel especially bad for the xtx owners as I understand that card did have some marketing with 'AI acceleration cores"" or something, but they seem utterly useless just a few years later. Add to that the fact if you're purchasing the brand's most expensive card, you have an underlying assumption that you are not really compromising on anything, but here we are.",Negative
AMD,"its because its on the feature that they cared about. frame generation for example, has already have had 2 iterations, both locking out the previous generatoin. first with FG with Lovelace, then MFG with Blackwell. Nvidia is getting less flack for it because not as many care about that feature.   I do agree that its dumb for AMD to do it now, but I find it silly that one would then move to Nvidia when theyve also been doing it. They just happen to be doing it on the whatever feature.",Neutral
AMD,yes but why are people complaining NOW that they are being cut off. it was obvious years ago that this would become a problem.,Negative
AMD,"I like framegen but MFG is just kinda overkill unless you have a 240hz+ monitor. Mine does 180 and 40 series single FG is usually more than enough to max it out. Even then I have to limit the game to 90 to not overshoot the monitors refresh. More frame gen would require limiting the game to an even lower base framerate, or overshooting the monitors refresh and dropping real frames. I feel like the only people that can really utilize MFG are people with very high refresh rate monitors, which is only a tiny segment of the population.",Negative
AMD,"By and large you're looking at a significant performance gap (double digits) with NVIDIA cards on Linux vs Windows when using Proton translation layer regardless.   AMD varies between single and low double digits depending on title, kernel version and so on. Sometimes it's right on the heels of Windows on certain titles based on the benchmarks I've seen.    It's generally advisable to go with AMD on Linux, and not just because managing drivers can be more of a PITA with NVIDIA cards, although that's another good reason, especially with older cards.   The NVIDIA drivers have issues. GN's video in particular showed some extreme edge cases with 50 series, including some edge cases where the 9070XT was performing ahead of a 5080 on Bazzite. Not everything by any means, but overall it's pretty bad. Not unusable by any means, I used a 1070 for a while on Mint, but you're not getting the performance you paid for.",Neutral

Worst ""offence"" is not giving FG to rtx 3000 cards, the generation released in 2020... more than 5 years ago. But they still get DLSS transformer model, with a larger performance hit. Exact same thing AMD could do, not ideal but it's there for people to use, without any modding.

AMD,Because it hurt more when the actual cut arrive.,Neutral
AMD,"again, the point is that people cared more about upscaling, rather than frame generation. So its not about the act of barring a generation of tech, because Nvidia had cut something off with a shorter leash (with FG > MFG). it's the matter of which feature being cut off, hence its silly to complain that the ACT of doing it, then jump ship instead of what got cut off.  If the argument was that AMD is holding off upscale, im jumping ship. Sure thats a fine stance to take. It's just silly to make the statment of ""AMD depricates features on recently sold GPU"" then jump ship to a company who did so with a shorter chain in an instance.",Neutral

But assuming your chip's IF is good, maxing out the FCLK with 4 sticks on both AM4 and AM5 is usually achievable with a few key tweaks and some trial and error (twrrd @ 3-4, correct Proc-ODT for your DRAM ICs, correct RTTs for your board, and finding the CLDO VDDP sweet spot of your IMC).  If you know the ins and outs of memory OC on both platforms, you will almost always be able to max out your linked FCLK limit before you run into your board/IMC MCLK limit with 4 sticks, at least assuming you didn't severely lose the IMC lottery (which is also a rarer occurrence than people think).""",Neutral

You can force the memory controller to run in 1:1 mode, but there's a good chance it won't be stable depending on silicon lottery and what your memory kit is.  It may be also worth checking if your kit has any lower frequency XMP profiles, using the one you currently are and manually reduce the speed to 6000, or grabbing buildzoid's easy timings and punching those in for 6000.  Remember that XMP/EXPO are considered overclocking and are not officially supported configurations, which is kind of BS from AMD because of how much they push EXPO configs in their marketing.",Neutral

AMD,"The biggest factor of whether this will be loved or ignored *(regardless of price)* is we know that it's going to be higher binned chip, but for overclockers, if the memory controller on it is improved and people can push RAM overclocking into the 8600Mhz to 9000Mhz, then it will sell out amongst enthusiasts instantly.  I expect Zen 6 to be able to do 9000Mhz+ but if they can squeeze out some extra juice with the 9850x3d on current generation, then it'll get the enthusiast community excited until Zen 6 drops.",Positive
AMD,4.7% more for a lot more heat and power.,Neutral
AMD,Memory has become so unattainable that it sort of moots any interest in upgrading from AM4,Neutral
AMD,Seems to be basically the same multi score you get with +200mhz maybe slightly higher single core because of 5.6ghz. If it costs more it will be meh. If it’s the same price then it will become a why not kinda upgrade over the 9800x3d but will likely also make the 9800x3d a better deal till its stock runs out at least,Neutral

AMD,So it's a 9800x3d with pbo on. Cool,Positive
AMD,"So like a normal 9800X3D, just mildly OC'd? Only real difference might be a better memory controller that could maybe handle 4 DIMMs of RAM easier/faster RAM, but seeing current RAM prices AMD might not even bother because who has the money for that sorta setup ATM?",Neutral

AMD,I’m waiting for 10800X3D,Neutral
AMD,"I genuinely wonder why they're releasing this chip now. Normally they do these type of things with GPUs on a refresh cycle, as they phase them out and have extras on the mature node. But here it just seems, unnecessary? Theres definitely a market for these top chips, but with the current RAM prices its harder to justify a premium OC product for a majority of consumers.",Negative
AMD,Make sense if its one ccd from 9950x3d.(and single core score is slightly lower)   So reduction from 5.7 to 5.6Ghz with reduced cache. Ofc i could be wrong but it would make sense to me.,Neutral
AMD,How would it compare to 9950 x3d tho,Neutral
AMD,This is only gonna make the jump to Zen 6 looks less impressive I feel lol.,Negative

AMD,When is it such to get released?,Neutral
AMD,Games rather need optimization. I have a 9800x3d and some games are still not working flawless. Since ram is unavailable anyway I fear that this might be a rats tail that will hurt the whole market. Because why buy a MB and CPU if you cannot afford 32gb of ram?,Negative
AMD,Will be great for cs2 with possible pbo +200 at 5.8 ghz. Will get one as soon as its available,Positive
AMD,"The majority of people commenting seem to be 9800X3D owners that are butt hurt that their CPU is no longer the absolute best. They all seem to understand that a 5% increase isn't going to make much of a difference on their setups, but are also sour about it at the same time. This product is not intended for people that already have a 9800X3D. Sure, some owners will swap them out. But the largest segment of buyers for this chip will be the massive 7800X3D/7600X3D/7700X/7600X user base, along with anyone willing to eat the RAM prices to move from AM4 to AM5.

Imagine selling your 9800X3D (a good sample capable of doing 6400 1:1 CL28 with tight timings) and ending up with a 9850X3D stuck at 6000 MT/s in a 1:1 configuration.",Neutral
AMD,"Zen 6 will be a huge generational improvement due to the elimination of the Infinity Fabric bottleneck and having ""sea of wires"" instead. We'll see large bandwidth and latency improvements.",Positive
AMD,"The memory controller will be exactly the same because the memory controller is in the iodie and they are not changing the iodie   On an 8 core amd cpu, 6000mt/s is already hitting the bandwidth limit on the fabric speed   For 8000mts ram to matter at all, you need multiple chiplets for ccd",Neutral
AMD,Lmao. No. They did not design a better IMC for this cash grab gamer brain chip.,Negative
AMD,I just wish for better memory controller that can easily support 4 sticks of ram instead of 2. It's been too many years of wait.,Negative
AMD,Why would they improve the memory controller on this when its getting revamped for Zen 6.  I don't really see the point for 1 chip.,Negative
AMD,"Will people go for it? By the time this is released the high performance RAM may cost the same, if not more, than the CPU",Neutral
AMD,And likely not very noticeable to anyone using a GPU worse than a 4090/5090,Negative
AMD,They seem to list it as the same power as the 9800X3D. I suspect this is just a better bin of zen5 chiplet,Neutral
AMD,"Not necessarily, they will be just better binned chips meaning higher clocks at lower voltage. Depending on how crazy these are binned you could technically have chips that pull similar power at 5.6ghz as a bad 9800x3d at 5.2.  I'm guessing most of them will just be a minor power increase over your typical 9800x3d.",Neutral

AMD,"Rumors of zen7 also on am5, I'd love that too, I can wait. The 7700x is no slouch, even though it's not that much high end.",Positive
AMD,"Sometimes the silicon comes out way nicer than expected, that's why they introduce a higher model model to sell them as. They don't want to sell the 9800X3D's that perform close to 5% better as ""9800X3D's"". They will label them as a better model and sell them that way. If silicon performs worse than expected, they label and sell them as lower models.",Neutral

AMD,"right 🤣🤣 I'm like..... ""but I overclock to those speeds already...""",Neutral
AMD,"I wouldn’t expect any memory controller difference. Even if a CPU had higher drive strength enabled, the memory chips on the DIMM would have to drive through the extra capacitive load of a second DIMM per channel being there.  The real solution for that problem is simply going threadripper with a second memory controller die. The problem with that is the drop in clock speeds ignoring cost of board and chip.",Neutral
AMD,Where is this idea coming from that there will be a better memory controller?,Neutral
AMD,"So, like nine months+ more?  Unless AMD suddenly switches up their strategy this round, it will be the same as before and we will get the non X3D parts first.  People are less and less willing to buy those for any sort of gaming load.",Negative
AMD,"It has been cooking for a while. AMD has released refreshes or updates to their lineup before. It has been almost a year since the 9800X3D released in that time they have no doubt either stockpiled or improved the process so much that they can justify a whole new part. And since it wont be another year before next gen, a mid lifecycle refresh is a great excuse to jump back to MSRP and keep selling CPU's.",Neutral
AMD,They bury intel on the charts further,Neutral

AMD,Yes and I know how bottlenecks work,Neutral
AMD,"TDP is ""thermal design power"" which refers to how much heat energy the cooling solution is expected to need to be able to exhaust in order for the device to run at manufactured spec.  The blanketed design of the x3d layer in the 7800x3d and earlier generations traps heat more strongly than in the 9800x3d where the x3d layer is on the bottom.   This trapping effect means that the older x3d cpus  cannot have too much power usage lest they burn, and that they need a stronger cooler than would typically be required for the amount of power they actually use lest they end up too hot and thermal throttle heavily.  I'm not saying the 9850x3d and 9800x3d are likely to use the same default power limits, but I am saying that their TDP are probably much more comparable than is the case as between the 9800x3d and 7800x3d.",Neutral
AMD,"Because usually in tech, CPU or GPU, higher clock speeds mean more power draw to achieve them. I'm sure in gaming with single threaded tasks there's no issues pushing 5.6GHz, but it will likely mean more wattage vs the 9800X3D doing those tasks IF the CPU is being pushed hard to make use of the extra. Plus higher clock speed you to go the silicon's limit, usually the efficiency curve plummets to get each extra bit of clock speed. Not sure how much 5.2 to 5.6GHz is pushing it, but the highest clocked Zen 5 is already only at 5.7GHz with the marked specs.",Neutral
AMD,"I’m on a 5600x3d, similar gaming performance to the 5800x3d and I can’t see myself upgrading till at least AM6",Neutral
AMD,"Right. My point is simply by understanding the underlying technology, such as rumor should never have become known unless someone could credibly explain how certain obstacles and technology limitations were overcome.  Personally, I have a flight sim using two systems and three GPUs. When originally bullt, the threadrippers didn’t have the clock speeds necessary to do what I needed for portions of code limited by single thread performance. I’m thinking hard about a strx50/wrx90 chip/board for next upgrade and collapsing two systems to one. Unfortunately the stupid DDR5 prices and overall cost of that jump are pushing it beyond budget right now. Getting rid of 1000-1500W of heat from one case is a solved problem for me and I already power off of 220V so even that’s not a concern.  The one x16 slot plus an X4 or x8+x8 +x4 are a bummer on AM4/AM5 because PCIe gen4 or gen5 100G Ethernet or 16/32g FC are costly, as are other solutions like PCIe fabric switches and the cabling.",Neutral
AMD,"I have built my first PC 5 days ago with a 9800X3D and 64GB 6400Mhz CL32 DDR5 ram and it runs stable with no issues in EXPO. Does that mean i have a ""gold sample""?",Positive

AMD,"Yeah us on AM5 will be okay... it's the people who don't have DDR5 already who are screwed and probs won't find any worth in upgrading when it'd cost so much.  Wonder how AMD will handle things with Zen 6 actually, they really can't charge too much now can they? The main market to appeal to now for them will be those already on a DDR5 platform, most of which will be AM5 owners (with some Intel 12-14th gen in the mix) where all the CPUs are still competent, just some on entry level Zen 4/5/Intel may still want something faster. Any AM4 owners who may have wanted to jump in next gen are screwed, same with old Intel platforms, AMD can't count on them anymore when RAM makes the platform switch itself insanity so AMD needs to get people with Rzyen 7600/7700s, other non X3Ds and Intel 12-14th gen owners want to buy Zen 6.",Neutral
AMD,"Haha, thats one of the games I didnt test. Could never get into it",Neutral
AMD,"it's not just ""how much heat energy"" but the area it's being emitted from too. Also, it's not a standard formula that every manufacturer uses, one heatsink company uses a different formula to define their TDP compared to a different heatsink company, so they aren't even directly comparable.  For example, a 5 millimeter square piece of silicon using 120w needs a higher TDP cooler than a 10 millimeter square one also using 120w. Coupled with the TDP ""bins"" AMD wants to put their CPUs in (either 65w, 105w, 120w, nothing inbetween right now) you get these wide spread where you have two 120w TDP CPUs and one uses literally twice the power as the other and even goes above the TDP rating stock (9800x3d uses 140w, tdp is 120w), tdp is just about the general class of cooler you need and not much else",Neutral

You can sell 9800x3d and add a little to get 9850x3d if you really care about slightly more performance, maybe better OC to you're memory if you got a bad chip currently and a better resell quality later because this chip is simple newer.

AMD,"That's not exactly how it works though. The undervolt offset is relative to starting point, he could have more headroom for the exact opposite reason from a performance/watt perspective (chip running higher vcore values from the factory)  Undervolt values don't mean anything without the actual voltages, frequency, stability, and other contributing variables if we're keeping it real.  It can also mean what you suggest, but without more info it's impossible to conclude either way. -30mV means nothing in its own, a better chip out of the box running at -20mV could very well be outperforming it without having more info.",Neutral

Doubt it'll have the value proposition in Zen 6's life to make sense either as the non X3D parts are always a lot cheaper and fill the price to performance role as is, and Zen 6 in leaks looks like a good one for uplifts cache or not unlike 5 that had a more bottlenecked design that benefited the cache parts more uplift wise.   I'm sure it'll sell though, it's why AMD is doing it, Zen 5 X3D is their golden milking machine that sells for MSRP even now, obviously business wise makes sense to release the golden bins that can clock higher for an extra 5% performance at a premium for those who want the best of the best NOW.

AMD,"Yeah, both are current tier CPUs. And your GPU is your bottleneck, maxed out.  On AM4, or similarly aged Intel CPUs, it is a different story. If somebody upgraded their GPU they will discover their CPU has to work hard on BF6.  My 5800X3D is still good but load of 80% when paired with a RX9070 is normal.

AMD,No one was asking you to do fuck all.,Negative
AMD,"No need, the 5700X3D is so close in gaming performance that the price difference is simply not worth it.",Negative
AMD,"Try 5700x3d or 5600x3d, you already have DDR4 memory from 8700k. Both Kenshi and Total War benefit massively from 3d cache. A friend of mine gave me his late game Kenshi savefile, and we tested it on 3 cpus: 12700k, 5800x3d and 9800x3d.  12700k had around 30 fps, 5800x3d around 100, and 9800x3d was close to 140 fps.",Positive

AMD,I wouldn’t be surprised if they are reasoning prices on CPUs to help hedge against rising ram cost.,Neutral
AMD,"There's legitimate no reason for a price hike.  There's a price hike in DRAM because nvidia is buying out all the allocation for their next gen AI GPUs. But 9000 series is built on *N4P whereas next gen AI GPUs will likely be built on N3P (Ruben) and N2P (Rubin Ultra, i.e. the ""SUPER"" refresh of AI GPUs). So there's no effect on AMD allocation as Nvidia have no need to buy out that node.*  AMD also likely have their allocation for N3P or N2P set for their next gen CPUs so unlikely to be hurt here either.  However, if rumours are true, all allocation for A16 has already been bought out by Nvidia, so there will be some competition down the line for sub N2P allocation between Apple, AMD and all of TSMC other high end customers.  We could even see CPUs stagnate for a few years over this.",Neutral

AMD,You are thinking logically. Companies think only about profits.,Neutral
AMD,Except if they raise prices when there's stock on the shelves people will stop buying.   The only time people buy at hyped up prices is when stock is non existent or extremely limited.,Negative
AMD,"In my opinion, AMD doesn't really need to raise the price for Ryzen 9XXX because-  1. It's been out for more than a year 2. Instinct is far more important for the stock than pure Ryzen revenue 3. Ryzen is now just a marketshare and mindshare play. 4. The more people buy into AM5, the more they'll be willing to upgrade to Zen 6 or 7 (if zen 7 is indeed on AM5), to divert people away from Nova Lake if Zen 6 is indeed a tad slower.",Neutral

AMD,"Doesnt binned usually mean cut down product that didnt meet the requirements, isnt this better than the 9800x3d?",Negative
AMD,"problem isn't in the money, its in the fact that you can't even get good kits as easy as you could month ago  this is also why AMD should be looking to restart 5000X3D production and expand to both 5900X3D and 5950X3D, sure not the latest and greatest but many people are not upgrading because of insane DDR5 pricing and would anyways appreciate 9700x performance but on affordable platform",Negative

AMD,"Yeah i had mostly heard it with the 7600x3d/7500x3d being binned versions of the 7800x3d, and the same with the 5700x3d/5600x3d to the 5800x3d",Neutral
AMD,"Ah just looked it up, and it can mean both",Neutral
AMD,"As someone on a 7600X...hold for Zen 6, pretty sure a slide AMD did last month put Zen 6 as 2026. This higher binned Zen 5 X3D is coming early 2026, it's just milking the last of what they can of Zen 5 X3D with a more expensive sku they can charge a premium for before Zen 6 tanks the value of such a part.   Like the clock speed boost is only 400mhz, that's maybe 7% higher boost (that will mean higher power draw), probably about 5-6% faster gaming performance if that. It isn't really going to change Zen 5 from being a skip to worth it if the 9800X3D wasn't enough for you already.   My plan is Zen 6, you'll get more cores per CCD as per leaks, AMD has confirmed a node leap which means higher clock speeds and better power efficiency so Zen 6 will be a GOOD generational leap for us, it won't be Zen 5% again.",Neutral
AMD,"people who are on AM5 are good as long as they have a DDR5 kit  issue is people who are still on AM4 literally don't have a reason to upgrade when platform cost has just gone up by $300 and improvement you get over 5800X3D is at most 20%  this is why AMD should be restarting zen 3 X3D production and expanding to 5900X3D and 5950X3D, their AM5 sales dropped by 50% FFS and that is not sustainable long term with complexity zen 5 X3D is having",Negative

The failure rate is much higher than other brands. Its such a sad situation as their motherboards on paper are best for value. Their PSUs are great though specifically the taichi and phantom ones as they provide over temperature protection for their 12vhpwr connections.,Negative

I don't have a better sensor than the motherboard temp sensor to judge air temperatures, but I'm pretty sure the air inside the chassis is like 12 degrees C above room temperature while gaming.  Next computer build will probably be in a more open, airflow-focused chassis with big, slow fans.  And I should note that the numbers quoted above are the worst-case I've seen.

AMD,Feels like that'll be the wisest move from now on; buy platforms when they've released they're last gen memory wise. Basically Zen 7 on AM5 and something on LGA 1954 (Hammer Lake?). DDR6 is going to be expensive and hopefully by then DDR5 will drop to low price for 8800+ MT/s Kits.,Neutral

AMD,"I could, but the rumors around Zen 6, make it *very* appealing, such as: 7+GHz clock speeds (over the 7800X3D’s 5), 12-core CCDs, an improved memory controller/IOdie, more IPC, 2 (4?) LP cores, a NPU, and.. possibly other things. More L1, L2 cache as well. If those are all true, a 50% or so performance boost, worth the upgrade I think.  Zen 7 is enticing too, but at least 2 years out from Zen 6. While the rumors have it on AM5, we also don’t know how the RAM crisis will change things. If, god forbid, RAM remains hideously expensive for years, then is there really a downside to going to DDR6, for the performance it brings? I could even see it being *cheaper* than DDR5 at launch bc of where the LLM demand is. But idk, that’s all just speculation, and hopefully the AI bubble will break soon and it’ll be a non-issue. Zen 7 on AM5 would be nice, yeah",Positive

AMD,Yeah that seems to be another problem,Negative
AMD,Then why comment if you’re not interested?,Neutral
AMD,"Because X3D of previous gen gets some discount when a new platform gets released, like 5800X3D was for a couple of months when AM5 got released (then price shot to the moon because last gen top chip of AM4 platform). So like the theoretical 11800X3D (if that gen is still AM5) or maybe a lower binned 11700X3D is gonna be cheaper when AM6 gets released.",Neutral
AMD,Likely waiting until 2030+ for that and paying a \*huge\* premium. 2029/2030 for Zen 7 X3D> 2035-2037 for Zen 10/Zen 11 X3D (whichever is the final AM6 gen) seems much more wiser.,Neutral
AMD,This is the way,Neutral
AMD,Yes AM5 7800x3D or 9800x3d would a good upgrade but i guess I'll wait till another gen. Currently my rig just sits at home most of the year because of work travel.   My current main setup is a LP7 7945HX 4080mobile. I have modded my laptop a bit which allowing me OC my CPU and ram which is running at 6000 CL36-37-37-34. Currently I am trying to tune a 6200 profile.   The FPS I get in both setups is pretty similar. I guess its because of the 5800x3D and slower ddr4.,Neutral

AMD,"MLiD usually predicts things further out, so he tends to be more inaccurate compared to many leakers, this isn't a surprise to me. Naturally, when you are talking about products a couple years out, lots of things aren't ""nailed down"" by the companies themselves, and therefore are subject to change. I'll also say something that applies to all leakers/rumormongers and not MLiD specifically: people like to slam them when they're wrong, but rarely give kudos when they're right. Either wrong or right, I do find the rumors to be entertaining though!  Zen 6 is jumping several nodes.

AMD, unless they're morons, will be using whatever current node was on offer, and that's TSMC N2 (N2P/N2/N2X). That's several nodes improved.   > the other half being their own marketing team.  Yeah, I'm in agreement there. Their marketing team, that whole side of AMD is just terrible.

Context/details matter. Ofc one shouldn't hold off a buying decision for a couple years based on rumors that could easily turn out to be wildly off. However, a few months out, when there's substantive leaks from multiple sources, would be a whole different thing.  Obviously Zen 6 (and Intel Nova Lake for that matter) is at least a year out, and ofc has totally unproven performance. All that said, it's hardly any secret what the node jumps make possible, and so AMD *could* do what is rumored, which is obviously not the same as saying they *will* do it.  > The reason we shouldn't credit MLiD when he's right, is because he usually keeps spewing BS until we're down to the wire and starts predicting things right as things get confirmed.

But as of now, we don't really have any information that directly points to a competing product.      In fact, I might be crazy but I feel like it is more likely that the actual answer to Strix Halo will be all Intel silicon, because Nvidia is very horny for all things ai and all things datacenter.",Neutral
AMD,"I mean no offense, but Passmark is irrelevant.  Even comparing the 890m to the 7600m (non-xt), the 7600m is usually twice as fast, with dips down to ~60% faster, and lifts up to ~170% faster.     NoteBookCheck has an extremely robust dataset of benchmarks in games for both the 890m and the 7600m (non-xt) at various resolutions, and they show not only a clear winner, but a very large difference in the performance of these devices.      Now I'm not trashing what the B390 will be, because we need an iGPU fight here.  But thinking that the 7600m (non-xt) is only ~15.7% faster than the B390 ((new-old)/old gives percent change) because of Passmark is erroneous.",Neutral

AMD,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works.

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance. I’ve shown full system specs and game settings every time, and provided more evidence than any tech site or tech YouTuber ever has, yet some people are still in denial.

AMD,"Intel still trying to sell their already abandoned platform, they should learn something good from AMD and provide support for three generations per socket (and yes, Zen 6 will use AM5, already confirmed by AMD).",Neutral
AMD,"Two things can be true at the same time. Arrow lake has legitimately improved since it launched last year, and Intel is portraying it in the best, most optimal light they can that is probably not representative of a broad spectrum of games reviewed by a third party.   It would be interesting to get a retest of arrow lake now, but I dunno if it is worth the time investment for some reviewer like TPU or HWUB to re-review a relatively poor platform that’s already halfway out the door.",Positive
AMD,"Arrow Lake performs quite well at general compute and power efficiency compared to prior generatons ans even against AMD.  Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU. Ironically the 9070 performance was identical with a 9700X and a 9800X3D.  So it's actually kind of the reverse, gaming reviewers painted Arrow Lake in the worst possible light.",Neutral
AMD,What do you mean by gaslighting in this case?,Neutral
AMD,"The answer depends on whether or not you're a ""next-gen AI gamer"" (apparently that means 1080p avg fps with a RTX 5090).",Neutral
AMD,I doubt they would give false numbers. Those are probably what you get with the setup they list in fine print. Also they pretty clearly show the 3dx parts are faster in gaming. But they have probably picked examples that show them in a good light.   There is nothing wrong per se in the arrow lake lineup. In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all. The issue that destroyed the image of arrow lake is that the previous generation was often faster in gaming. That made every reviewer give it bad overall reviews.,Neutral
AMD,Wait till refresh comes out in December... Memory latency lower and performance boosted. Price also lower... Wish it could come to the old chips but it architecturally cant. :(,Negative
AMD,"generally they cherry pick, so maybe the demo they use is process heavy with minimal I/O (arrow's biggest performance hit is memory movement). if you manage to keep memory movement low core performance is actually really good on arrow lake. it just gets massacred by d2d and NGU latency, which they don't get a pass for but its unfortunate that decent core designs are held back severely by packaging.",Neutral

AMD,"As a real world example, I upgraded my primary system from a 14700k to a 265k recently. My other desktop is a ryzen 7900 (non x, 65 watt tdp)  Compiling my os takes 6 minutes on the 7900, 10 minutes on the 265k, 10 minutes on a 3950x, and 16 minutes on the 14700k.   That is not in windows, but my os which does not have thread director or custom scheduling for e cores. (So going to be worse than windows or Linux)   All the numbers except the 7900 are with the same ssd, psu, custom water loop.  The motherboard and cpu changed between Intel builds and the 3950x was the previous build before the 14700k.   The e core performance significantly improved in arrow lake.  It’s now keeping up with 16 core am4 parts in the worst possible scenario for it.  If the scheduler was smarter, I think it would be very close to the 7900.   In windows, it’s pretty close in games I play on frame rate to the old chip. A few are actually faster.",Neutral

AMD,Telling people that its performance is better than it actually is?,Negative
AMD,The ones with similar pricing not performance,Neutral
AMD,"True, except AM5 supported all cpus 7000, 9000 and will support the newest one. So not exactly true per se, because you need a new motherboard every time and those on AM5 can upgrade cpu without buying a board. Imagine if someone was on 13400F and wanted to buy lets say 285K? Well, you need a new board. So it depends what “cheaper” is seen as.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep. We all see the patterns here. Gamers nexus, HUB, LTT and most big name they all keep mocking Intel, even when Intel did good job to bring improvements to their products like fixing Arrow Lake gaming performance but those ""tech reviewer"" decided to be blind, they don't even want to revisit Intel chip and benchmark it, they don't even want to educate their viewers.    At the same time they keep overhyping Amd products to the moon like they own the stock, it's obvious now who is the real reviewer and who is fraud reviewer using their own popularity and big headline to spread their propaganda for their own benefits. They are just as worse as shady company!",Negative
AMD,"Platform longevity isn't stupid lol. There's a reason why am4 is one of the best selling and one of the best platforms of all time. The fact that you can go from a 1700x to a 5800x3d on the same mobo for 85% more performance is crazy good value. You can say that all you want but there's a reason why in the diy market everyone is buying amd over intel. People know arrow lake is doa where as am5 actually has a future, which is why everyone is flocking to the 9800x3d in droves.  Zen 7 is rumored to be on am5 as well. Meaning that am6 would come out in 2030/2031. If that's true am5 lived for around 8/9 years.  That's insane value to get out of one socket.",Positive
AMD,Quite common for AM4 in my experience.,Neutral

Kinda want better 1% lows tbh, but maybe I’ll just wait for next ones unsure.",Neutral
AMD,"How is it stupid? On one hand, intel sockets used only 3 gens from 12th-14th while on the other hand amd has not only used 7000-9000 but will also be using zen 6. I don't think you realize just how big of a hassle changing motherboards are",Negative

AMD,"I agree with you, it’s daft, no doubt about it. But you’ve got to factor in that people can be daft too. Most tend to skimp, only to end up buying another middling CPU the following year, and then again after that. And so the cycle trundles on.  When I buy PC parts, I usually go for the best available. Provided the price is reasonably sane. I picked up a 9900K seven years ago and it’s still holding its own. Is it on par with the 9800X3D? Of course not. But it’s still a very capable bit of kit. Next time I upgrade, I’ll go top shelf again.",Neutral
AMD,"They frequently revisit products and test old hardware, but naturally that's not going to be their focus. Channels with that focus like RandomGaminginHD fill that niche.",Neutral
AMD,Sooo they are in the YouTube space for the money not for the love of tech,Neutral
AMD,"So true. After all they are reviewer, it's their job to revisit something if it's worth to benchmark due to improvements.   Didn't they said they want to educate their viewers?

AMD,"If only the Arc B770 can beat the RX 9070XT with performance and features, then I definitely stay on Intel's side, but RN I doubt it",Neutral
AMD,"Even accepting that as true, I don’t think it changes the main point I was making. Arrow Lake has probably improved versus a year ago. It’s probably not as good as intel is making out. A good third party reviewer would be needed to determine by how much, yet it’s probably not worth their money and time to test it.   So the truth is probably in between what Intel is saying here and what the state of things was 6 months ago.",Negative

I installed the contact frame in August, and everything was fine until two weeks ago, when the desktop suddenly stopped booting. The fans were spinning, but there was no POST, no debug LED — nothing. I thought the motherboard was dead.   However, when I removed the AIO head and tried to boot again, it worked!  Since then, I’ve been experiencing intermittent no-POST issues, especially after gaming sessions.   To get it to boot, I always have to adjust the screws on the AIO head. If it’s too tight: no POST. If it’s too loose: CPU temperatures are high. For example, in Hogwarts Legacy, I get around 60 FPS with an RTX 4090, while the CPU runs at around 18% usage @ 85°C. Which is not normal at all, as I used to run the game at around 100–110 FPS.  I tightened the screws on the contact frame using my thumb and index fingers.

AMD,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Neutral

AMD,"u/hus1030  The mounting pressure from your AIO cooler can directly affect whether the system successfully completes POST. When the cooler is tightened too much, it can cause the CPU or motherboard to bend slightly, which may lead to poor or lost contact between the CPU and the socket pins. This prevents the processor from initializing properly, resulting in a no-POST condition. Installing a contact frame changes the pressure distribution compared to the stock retention mechanism, so overtightening the AIO screws can amplify this issue. On the other hand, if the screws are too loose, the CPU temperatures will rise because the cooler is not making proper thermal contact. To avoid these problems, ensure the AIO screws are tightened evenly in a cross pattern and do not exceed the manufacturer’s torque specifications. If the issue persists, you may need to verify that the contact frame is correctly installed or temporarily revert to the original retention bracket to rule out pressure-related problems.",Neutral

AMD,"u/Any_Information429 Your HP EliteBook 830 G8 is experiencing boot issues due to corrupted Intel Management Engine (ME) firmware, which is a critical low-level system component that manages hardware initialization. This corruption is causing the blinking caps lock light, multiple restart attempts before successful boot, and the extended Windows startup times you've been experiencing. The BIOS showing ""ME Firmware Mode: Recovery Mode"" confirms this diagnosis. Since these issues began after your recent repair, it's likely that the Management Engine chip connections were disturbed or the firmware became corrupted during the service process.  To resolve this, you need to perform a forced recovery of the ME firmware by downloading the specific firmware version for your EliteBook model from HP's support website-[HP EliteBook 830 G8 Notebook PC Software and Driver Downloads | HP® Support](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/hp-elitebook-830-g8-notebook-pc/38216726) and using specialized recovery tools to reflash the Management Engine. You also have check BIOS settings to ensure proper ME configuration and temporarily disable fast boot to allow complete initialization. If the firmware recovery doesn't resolve the issue, this may indicate hardware-level damage to the ME controller that occurred during the previous repair, which would require professional chip-level service or potentially warranty coverage since the problem originated after authorized service work. The good news is that once the ME firmware is properly restored, your system should return to normal boot times and eliminate the restart cycles you're currently experiencing.  USB flash recovery method is definitely worth trying first - it's designed specifically for these types of firmware corruption issues and should get your laptop back to normal boot times without all those frustrating restarts.

Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive.

Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.

AMD,"3D cache will eventually become full of assets and dip, if and onlyif IMC is bottlenecked by random memory access.  - the ability for cache to transfer data from memory, to IMC, to cache has a FPS hit (cache hit-rate). This is due to the bottleneck of a chiplet-based IOD: compromising memory latency with cache hit-rate. Eventually the cache fills and relying on IMC to feed the cores anyway.  You can easily test this by monitoring 1% lows and increasing memory latency (lowering DDR4 B-die clocks/DDR5 hynix and increasing timings) to see how Cache holds up when full of assets while memory is being bottlenecked-   What games need is 10-12 P-Cores and an IMC capable of high speeds.

As for clocks, the core scales to max 5.2ghz (default 4.6ghz), certainly overall slower than Zen 4. IPC is a comparison about throughput at a given clockspeed. Its a give to compare you will need to match the clocks.  Funny you you should mention latencies, considering that core to core (even accross clusters), latencies of Skymont are better than Lion Cove? So if latency is the issue, it has nothing to do with Skymont and everything to do with the trash uncore they have based on the Meteorlake SOC. Even workstation Crestmont on a different package performs better. Furthermore skymont IPC is measured based on Arrowlake. Arrowlake is worse latency than Raptorlake and Zen already.

For the i9 they can have 4 such solitary E-cores that have their own cache and hence do not touch the L3 cache.

AMD,Balanced in full load will just do the same thing as High Performance.,Neutral
AMD,"It's capable of a few things, but the main mechanism from what I've seen is that it temporarily disables three out of four cores in each E-core cluster by forcing them into the lowest power state. The result is that the remaining active core has access to each cluster's full L2 cache (2MB on 12th-gen, 4MB on 13th/14th-gen). L2 cache isn't shared with P-cores (L3 is global), so this can really minimize E-core cache evictions before they're forced into slower memory, and games do love themselves some cache.  It's a genuinely clever way of maximizing available resources and I really wish they'd allow user control over its features, but it seems to be pretty tightly leashed to/by the team that developed it. It obviously wouldn't benefit every situation, such as particularly low/high thread occupancy situations, but it's pretty rough to have the option tied to quarterly updates for one or two specific games.",Neutral

AMD,They are they came up with ML for their upscaller before the red team did and even better than FSR as a dump upscaler and they also did a good RT implementation. But the hardware still has raw horse power issues and they already use a big die for what it can do.  In the 80's or they shammed The DEC Alpha team on subnormal floating point operations with the 8087 FPU. Intel was doing way more precession without having to round so earlier on a consumer FPU while the Alpha CPU was a Mainframe one.

AMD,"Great explanation that makes sense!  It definitely has to do with the cache, that much is true.

Remember AMD didn't have any ai hardware for their first 2 gens on RDNA and RDNA 3 didn't have enough for FSR4 either. It's not that intel were better at producing a ML upscaler. They just had the hardware for it from the get go so they could implement it quicker.  They did make Xess though which is miles ahead of FSR 3 even on AMD systems (on average.

When I was testing some stuff out (trying to see how close I could get my Deck to the Switch 2 build) I found Xess to be a unsuitable. Even on the lightest Xess mode, the performance hit was a bit too noticeable. FSR doesn't look as good as Xess but it runs better and you can get away with a bit more upscaling artifacting on the Decks relatively small screen. Just rendering at a lower res and letting the screen upscale was also a solid option in that scenario.  As I say though, that's an edge case where you really just need outright speed. If your GPU doesn't support DLSS or FSR4 then using Xess makes sense in the vast majority of cases.",Neutral

AMD,"the game is just really latency sensitive, i dont think it will even change in the full release sadly  i kinda wonder what makes the game so demanding on CPUs, the mechanics and physics arent much better compared to older BF (like BF4) that barely use modern CPUs beyond 20 - 30%",Negative
AMD,"Dealing with same issue on a 285k + 5090. dipping to 125 fps curing certain scenarios specifically on the cairo map at point C. MY system should not struggle at all at 1440p to reach 144 fps, but the 285k is getting absolutely destroyed by bf6 and I have no idea what the issue is,",Negative
AMD,"It's not like game runs bad on Intel CPU which has P and E cores, i will be lying if i say that. It's about maximizing CPU performance. CPU demanding game will runs with much higher FPS when it knows which thread should be utilized.    This is why game with APO enable like R6S on i9-14900K at 1080p low settings, it got performance increase up to 100FPS which is massive.",Neutral
AMD,"Most games are optimized for consoles which are natively eight cores, and a lot are ported over to PC and so you basically need eight fast cores in whatever CPU you happen to have, and the rest don't really do much. That's why Intel HEDT and AMD's Threadripper aren't of much use in this regard.",Neutral
AMD,"No, that's because and isn't really better for gaming unless you get their x3d variants. Those have a different style of memory that is better for gaming in particular but can underperform when it comes to workload tasks. Idk why 🤷",Negative
AMD,"Yeah and in a game like bf, I only care about the 1% low staying at minimum my monitor refresh rate 🫠 But I have not spend that much time optimizing my settings so I think I can work around it",Neutral
AMD,"I found a ""fix""   Dynamic render scale, I set it to 75, so when shit really hits the fan, it just lowers the render scale for just enough time for me to not drop below my monitor refreshrate, and it happens so fast I don't see the change in gfx",Negative
AMD,"From what I understand, many games are generally fairly latency sensitive. The fast cache on the X3D chips basically helps with that.",Neutral
AMD,Thank you :),Positive
AMD,Wouldn't the 300 series actually be Arrow Lake Refresh?,Neutral
AMD,"Videocardz is wrong      This chip will likely be called ""Core Ultra 5 445k"" it's an 8+16 die with bLLC + 4LPe   (Not sure what suffix Intel will use to denote bLLC SKU maybe ""L"")    Ultra 3 has 4P + 4E + 4LPe  Ultra 5 has the 1x 8+16 tile + 4LPE   Ultra 7 has 8+6 P-Cores and 16+8 E-Cores +4LPe   Ultra 9 had 2x 8+16 tiles + 4LPe tile   Ultra 300 series will be reserved for mobile only Panther Lake and/or Arrow Lake Refresh   Ultra 400 will almost certainly be Nova Lake.",Neutral
AMD,I think this competition will tight up alot in the next gen for both intel and AMD.  Intel has had a superior memory controller for awhile now and AMD will finally address this in Zen 6.  AMD has better cache setup with VCache which Intel will finally address in NL.  May the superior arch win!,Positive
AMD,This is pat's work,Neutral
AMD,This is normal Nova Lake or the bLLC version? I heard the bLLC version has separate SKUs.,Neutral
AMD,8 Big cores with loads of cache and then a couple of E cores with their own cache for background tasks would be great.,Positive
AMD,Is Intel finally making a comeback with their cpus? I hope so,Positive
AMD,Large L3 cache without reducing latency will be fun to watch.,Positive
AMD,the specs sure do shift a lot..,Neutral
AMD,"Now we are talking Intel! If they can hold on to these chips, not melting themselves, then it's gonna be a good fight",Positive
AMD,it's just a bunch of cores glued together - intel circa 2016 probably,Neutral
AMD,Not sure I can trust Intel again after the BS around Arrow Lake and the lack of ongoing LGA 1851 upgrade path.,Negative
AMD,Bout time,Neutral
AMD,"Like I commented before, hope (but really don't believe) this is NOT the product that is only 10% faster than arrowlake because liquidation awaits them otherwise",Negative
AMD,Will it be available in fall of this year or 26Q1?,Neutral
AMD,So it only took them like 5 years to come up with a luke-warm response. cool cool. It's especially bad as Intel actually introduced something similar (eDRAM LLC) into the x86 space many years ago.,Negative
AMD,Noob question:  Is this their 16th gen chips?,Neutral
AMD,Planning on upgrading from my 13700K to whatever the top end Nova Lake is,Neutral
AMD,Only Core i3 can have 65watt ? no more i5 at 65Watt ?,Neutral
AMD,"For some reason it seems to me that all these new different micro cores are cores from ten years ago at the level of Broadwell or Lynnfield, but made on thin nm to fit everything under one lid lmao",Neutral
AMD,"What is it with Intel and 8 ""pcores""  how about just do 24 cores 48 threads",Neutral
AMD,Cool.  I have said for a while now that is want both the extra cache AND a few lesser cores to offload stuff to.  The only alternative that has this atm is the 9900x3d and the 9950x3d.  Next gen when im buying new stuff then perhaps intel will have an alternative to those then.,Positive
AMD,"The 52 cores is exciting, but I would probably use Linux as my main OS and run Windows in a VM. Plenty of cores and plenty of RAM and it would be a great machine.  A 52 core desktop beast with an Intel graphics card with 128 GB VRAM would be a killer machine. LLMs would run like lightening.",Positive
AMD,"Intel mocking the chiplet design, describing it as gluing processors together and then doing it themselves - this screams that energy once again.",Neutral
AMD,So Nova Lake IS happening? This talk about skipping to next node had me anxious..,Negative
AMD,"So alder lake on cache steroids ?  If the heavier core count chips don’t have the LLc cache, and if this chip is faster at gaming than the heavier core count chips, how will Intel market it?   If they call it a core ultra 5 or 7, then that will make the core ultra 9 seem less of a halo product.  Will be interesting to see how they market it.",Neutral
AMD,"E core need to get lost for gaming, we need 9800x3d rival, purely for gaming !",Neutral
AMD,"""E-Cores"",  Ewww, Gross.",Neutral
AMD,"**Hi,**  I’m currently running a 9700K paired with a 5070 Ti. Do you think I should upgrade to Arrow Lake Refresh now, or hold out for Nova Lake?  The CPU’s clearly starting to bottleneck a bit, but it’s not super noticeable yet.  Is it worth waiting for Nova Lake, or better to just go with Arrow Lake Refresh when it drops?",Neutral
AMD,NVL will definitely be the 400 series. PTL is 300.,Neutral
AMD,"Naming can be changed, but the most important thing is, this isn't the upcoming arrow lake refresh  I hope arrow lake refresh fix the memory controller latency tho",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, I expect the 300 series to be Arrow Lake refresh and Panther Lake.",Neutral
AMD,"> (Not sure what suffix Intel will use to denote bLLC SKU maybe ""L"")  Maybe they will bring back the ""C"" from i7-5775C.   Behold, the Core Ultra 7 465KFC",Neutral
AMD,I suspect it'll be like:  495K: 16+32.  485K: 12/14+24/32.  475K: 8+16.  465K: 8+12.  Etc.,Neutral
AMD,Seeing all those different cores on a chip does look cool. But I presume this idea will end up being butchered by Windows not being able to schedule things properly,Neutral
AMD,"So if Arrow Lake Refresh comes out this year, next year we'll get Nova Lake? Or in 2027? Either way Zen 6 vs Nova Lake will be interesting.",Positive
AMD,Taking the 'L' to their own CPUs would generally be considered a bad marketing move.,Negative
AMD,"We'll see how far Zen 6 takes us on memory. Strix has improvements, hopefully that wasn't all of it though.",Neutral
AMD,"If intel doesn't screw itself with stupid tdp, reliability issues, or bad relative performance",Negative
AMD,More like *despite* him.,Neutral
AMD,All the SKUs rumored so far are BLLC,Neutral
AMD,"They have graduated from background tasks. At this point, even LPE cores can handle apps like Microsoft teams by themselves with no issue never mind the E cores on the ring bus",Neutral
AMD,"If the scheduler can really support this. As soon as a game would hit the e cores, it could turn bad.",Negative
AMD,Why not 8 P cores with HT + even more cache and no e cores at all,Neutral
AMD,"A large L3 will help a ton with latency. It's why AMD has so much success with it using chiplets which have a ton of extra latency. Reduces all those higher latency trips out to RAM. Intel's Nova Lake processors are expected to feature the memory controller integrated back into the CPU tile and if that's the case this L3 might be a really big hit for gaming, etc.",Positive
AMD,If latency slightly increases or stays the same due to adopting Pantherlake optimizations and the newer Foveros then that might be enough to narrow the gap,Neutral
AMD,I assume the cache is based on Lunar Lake's memory side cache which doesn't bring much if any noticeable latency over Arrowlake H,Neutral
AMD,"Also done with them. Changing socket every \~3 years was also bad, but this is disgusting.",Negative
AMD,"Not sure how it could be, given all the extra cores.  That said, for lower core count workloads, like gaming, I doubt gains of more than 10% are achievable by anyone, at this point.  I expect NVL to be a big power/thermals/multithreading win, than anything else.",Neutral
AMD,Nova lake? More like 26Q4.,Neutral
AMD,Only Pantherlake for mobile,Neutral
AMD,"It doesn’t matter so long as all major vendors will automatically ship with whatever Intel puts out. Lenovo, dell, and HP carry a grand total of *zero* desktop Zen 5 (granite ridge) machine across their consumer, gaming, and business line. You heard that right, *zero* among the global big three.",Neutral
AMD,"Since when they are ""mocking chiplet design""? Have you forgot Intel is the first when it comes to gluing chip together? Intel did this with Core 2 Quad. Meanwhile Amd copying that with ryzen but sadly people don't want to admit it.",Neutral
AMD,It is really happening. The only question is when? Or can they release it on the next year without delay?,Neutral
AMD,"Core Ultra 9 has 48 cores (and 4 LPE cores). It slaps you in the face as halo SKU (unless it becomes entry level threadripper target?).  Currently rumored:  (8+16E+BLLC, 8+16E)  8+16E+BLLC  8+12E+BLLC",Neutral
AMD,The i9 sku is rumored to be two 8+16 tiles. So slotting in an extra bLLC 8+16 tile instead of a normal 8+16 one for the top sku doesn't sound impossible.,Neutral
AMD,Probably same way AMD did the 5800X3D 8 core which was slower than the 5800X at productivity and had less cores than the 12 core 5900X and 16 core 5950X.,Neutral
AMD,"E cores are the future, P cores days are numbered.",Neutral
AMD,ARL refresh is not worth it. Go AMD or wait for NVL if you want.,Neutral
AMD,If you have to upgrade now for gaming get a 9800x3d from AMD otherwise wait and see what AMD Zen 6 and Nova Lake can do.,Neutral
AMD,"You just missed some pretty killer deals around Prime Day; that would have been the ideal time to go with Arrow Lake.  The 'refresh' will offer better performance, but I highly doubt the value difference will be significant.     You can definitely wait a bit.",Neutral
AMD,"I would like the naming with suffix ""C"" for cache at the end or maybe ""G"" for gaming.",Neutral
AMD,"W11 has (mostly) fixed the scheduling issues, in fact the scheduler was already pretty good by the time Raptor Lake launched. Sometimes it can mess things up but it's quite rare nowadays. The only time I have seen some small issues is with legacy single threaded software.",Neutral
AMD,"Why would it be butchered? the issues with big/little are long gone now - but I guess to your type none of that matters - getting upvotes for blind anti-MS zealotry is all that matters.  but given that this is an intel sub, i am surprised its not merely blind anti intel zealotry instead.",Negative
AMD,">So if Arrow Lake Refresh comes out this year, next year we'll get Nova Lake?  Yes. Intel has confirmed NVL will launch in 2026.",Neutral
AMD,The former ceo,Neutral
AMD,"Raichu has repeatedly talked about BLLC ""variants"", so I wouldn't assume that all skus have the large L3.   Plus, it seems extremely wasteful to have all the skus have BLLC.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, Skymont are more like space efficient P cores that are down clocked and don't have all of the features. IPC is really good.",Positive
AMD,This is wrong. Arrow Lake already uses E cores for gaming to no performance hit.   12-14th Gen sure. But not with the new E cores and no HT. You’re using dated info.,Negative
AMD,"A number of public tests have shown that, even with all the P-cores disabled, ARL is still pretty good in gaming.  It's not the E-cores.",Positive
AMD,No different to 12-14th gen then.,Neutral
AMD,"windows pretty much gave up on this and just allows you to set to performance mode, which always tries to grab a P core first.",Negative
AMD,"Or that I forgot they don't have HT on the newer chips.   To be honest I was meaning 14th gen P and E cores with more cache not the new gen stuff. We know the IPC, memory controller and core speed is enough it's just the cache that makes it fall behind AMD in gaming.",Neutral
AMD,E core is 30% faster than hyper threading,Positive
AMD,HT is worse than E cores,Negative
AMD,>Intel's Nova Lake processors are expected to feature the memory controller integrated back into the CPU tile  They aren't,Neutral
AMD,It will enlarge the ontile L3 cache most likely with a cache only tile with high performance die to die connect. No 3d stacking until 18A-PT is available for production which will likely be well after Nova Lake tapeout which should be done now or with in the next few months in order to ramp up production in early 2026 and be on the market by late 2026.,Neutral
AMD,">That said, for lower core count workloads, like gaming, I doubt gains of more than 10% are achievable by anyone, at this point.  If you are in the lead, maybe this argument is valid. However Intel is behind Apple in ST and behind AMD in gaming. They have plenty of room to improve.",Neutral
AMD,"> That said, for lower core count workloads, like gaming, I doubt gains of more than 10% are achievable by anyone, at this point  And yet we see that constantly.",Negative
AMD,"Ze3vsZen2, Zen 4vsZen3, Zen 5 X3D vs Zen 4 X3D, Alderlake vs RocketLake, Raptorlake vs AlderLake, Lunarlake/Arrowlake-H (Mobile) vs Meteorlake U and H, Gracemont vs Tremont, Skymont vs Gracemont and Crestmont, Many Arm or Arm based designs, etc",Neutral
AMD,ARM chips regularly do this sometimes on a yearly basis.,Neutral
AMD,A lot of gamers have no clue that Intel is actually doing well with ARL for OEM laptops/dekstops as ARL is basically a laptop design warmed over for desktop chip usage.,Neutral
AMD,Core 2 quads and Ryzen chiplets are totally different ways of doing MCMs  C2Q didnt have an IO die and it pretty much worked like having a 2 socket motherboard      IO die is what enabled much lower latency and the ability to connect much more CPU dies together (EPYC 9005 got 16 CCDs),Neutral
AMD,https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-slide-criticizes-amd-for-using-glued-together-dies-in-epyc-processors/,Neutral
AMD,"> They stopped trying to sell capacity to external customers and they will try again with 14a. It's not like they had a lot of capacity to spare. It's not even enough for themselves  Intel claims they can double to 1.5x their EUV capacity in arizona and ireland, if customers asked for it, in 1-2 years.   They built out all they needed for their own internal 18A demand too.",Neutral
AMD,"It shouldn't become an entry level workstation part since the Ryzen 9 will have 24c/48t to go against it.   48 cores (plus the 4 LPe, but those shouldn't factor in too much) should handily beat 48 threads, but not by enough to reach Threadripper territory.",Neutral
AMD,Most likely the bLLC variant wil be single compute tile and single cache tile as this would be cheaper for now than putting bLLC cache in base tile like Amd did. They can do that when 18A-PT is avaliable which will probably be after Nova Lake goes into production with 18A or maybe 18A-P,Neutral
AMD,"Lmao, some of my games still runs on e cores",Neutral
AMD,People are still disabling e cores for more performance.,Neutral
AMD,"Varients because there are two tiles. One with BLLV, one without. Full chip had 1 BLLC chip and 1 without. No actual SKU (not tile) without BLLC in some way so far",Neutral
AMD,"They are nothing like P-core as designed with no hyperthreading, area/space efficienct and integrated into clusters of 4 e-cores with shared L2 cache",Neutral
AMD,fym no different they're 50% faster,Neutral
AMD,No. ARL architecture is definitely not optimized for latency but hiding memory access which favours multithreading instead of gaming. Hopefully Nova Lake will optimize all the latecy issues with ARL arch and decrease latency to L3 considerably aswell,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, but in games, it's the P-cores that are meant to be utilized. Also, more than eight cores or 16 threads aren't really necessary for gaming. The 9950x3d isn't faster, than the 9900x3d.  My point is that the space taken up by the E-cores could instead be used for additional cache, not?",Neutral
AMD,I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it. Anyhow if that's true the large L3 should be even more helpful for things like gaming as it will keep those higher latency hits down. AMD has always had higher latency due to the same kind of design with a separate memory controller so we have pretty good data on how extra cache can help.,Neutral
AMD,"As a advice, Nova Lake will further increase memory latency.",Neutral
AMD,In which gen iteration?,Neutral
AMD,Editorialized. But its funny because said quote is attributed to AMD when Intel made Core2Duo (or Quad?),Neutral
AMD,"If its is with 10% of threadripper 9960x at half the price, it will definitely hurt the low end threadripper cpus a lot for productivity/creator types who would love a more reasonable priced high performance entry level workstaion. Low end workstation is probably bigger market than high end gaming desktops anyways.",Negative
AMD,"Another factor is that Apple has booked out all the N2 capacity for the better part of a year before AMD can touch it.  Nova Lake will have been out for a while, before AMD shows up",Neutral
AMD,Process lasso can let you just designate by task so the E cores can do background and side jobs. People use process lasso on the 7950x3d to make the X3D chiplet run games with those 8 cores and the other 8 core chiplet for everything else.,Neutral
AMD,What issue did you run into with a 9800x3d? It has one CCD and no small cores,Neutral
AMD,"Nowadays there are very few cases where disabling E cores is extremely beneficial, sometimes they are a detriment to performance but more often than not they are useful. Not to mention the E core design team is more competent than the P core team and are quickly catching up in performance.    The E cores in Alder Lake had relatively poor ST performance but in Arrow Lake they are much faster and closer to the P cores in raw performance. Every new generation the gap keeps shrinking and it will make the disabling of E cores less and less relevant.    Sometimes the Windows scheduler will wrongly assign an E core to a ST bound task, even if a P core is available, but it doesn't happen often enough to be a serious issue.",Neutral
AMD,"yes, but not because of windows scheduling - its because you can OC higher with them off - better temps and easier stability - some people disable HT for the same.",Neutral
AMD,They don't pay attention,Neutral
AMD,"No. Intel needs to do what Amd did and add seperate bLLC just for gaming. As long as latency is reduced to the L3 cache including bLLC, gaming performance will definitely increase as 285K and 9950x have similar performance in both gaming and productivity with small lead going to Amd. But x3d totally dominates ARL beacsue of the obvious huge cache difference and lower overall latency to their cache implementation.",Neutral
AMD,That is more so bc the 9950x3d isn’t really a 16 core cpu it is two 8 cores,Neutral
AMD,"There was one article a while back that reported something like ""intel goes back to integrated mc"", not understanding that panther lake is a fundamentally different product than the tile based desktop products.",Neutral
AMD,How do you think they're doing 2 compute tiles if the memory controller is on one?,Neutral
AMD,">I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it.  I'm curious, which leakers have said otherwise?   You could still have mem latency improvements without the mem controller being on the compute tile too, so the situation there can improve either way.   >AMD has always had higher latency due to the same kind of design with a separate memory controller so we have pretty good data on how extra cache can help  Yup, and ARL has higher mem latency than AMD even, so obviously there is room to improve even without having to move the mem controller back.",Neutral
AMD,"Intel will definitely decrease latency with Nova lake and as long as they add a bigger L3 cache variant, gaming performance will increase further to challenge AMD",Positive
AMD,"If you go straight to the source, the quote they used is directly on Intel's slides. Intel literally wrote that, regardless of who said it first.   [https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pPtQr2PKSemDqkhahtz8VN.jpg](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pPtQr2PKSemDqkhahtz8VN.jpg)",Neutral
AMD,"I mean that it won't be priced like an HEDT part. It'll definitely perform like current generation lower end Threadrippers, but so will the 11950x.",Neutral
AMD,"NVL high end desktop skus are rumored to be on N2 as well. Intel has confirmed NVL desktop will be on TSMC, and Intel has also confirmed some NVL compute tiles will be external.   It's very possible Zen 6 DT is out before NVL-S, and it's very likely that NVL-S and Zen 6 launch within a few months of each other, if that even.   Also, if AMD wants to pay for TSMC N2 capacity, TSMC will build it out. Just a couple days ago we had a [report](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250724PD213/tsmc-2nm-capacity-2028-3nm.html) about TSMC being very aggressive with N2 scale out, and the reasoning here is two fold- first of all, 2026 is technically the 2nd year of N2 HVM, and also because a *lot* of major SOCs, other than just Apple and AMD, will be on N2- demand for N2 is high, and build out will be too.",Neutral
AMD,AMD is one of the leading N2 early adopters. Both TSMC and AMD announced this.,Neutral
AMD,That didn't stop Intel with N3B,Neutral
AMD,The recent Warhammer space marine game is a game that benefited from disabling e cores. I am not sure the disparity between arrow and alder in that game tho.,Neutral
AMD,">Intel needs to do what Amd did and add seperate bLLC just for gaming.  Thats what I tried to say.  >My point is that the space taken up by the E-cores could instead be used for additional cache, not?  Or isn't that enough? AMD stacks the cache directly on top (9000 Series) or under (9000 series) the CPU cores, right?",Neutral
AMD,"Yes but IF Intel decides to do quad channel for AI nonsense at least for flagship model, Amd threadripper will be stomped over as I will definitely buy the Nova Lake part just for the price/performance compared to 9960x threadripper. The motherboard selection alone for Z890 is absolutely amazing and RDIMM prices aretwice as expensive for the same amount of memory. I expect with CAMM2 that max ram capaciity will go for 512GB and maybe 1TB for Nova Lake aswell. Even with 2 channel, cudimm will go above 10,000 MTS and maybe 12000 if we are lucky on CAMM2 modules by 2027 as CAMM2 definitely being used for DDR6   I do feel Intel has I/O advantage beyong gaming and that market is getting bigger than hardcore gamers all the time!! A decked out 256GB Arrow Lake z890 based computer is way cheaper than same memory sized threadripper 9960x.",Positive
AMD,"I don't recall Intel stating that NVL core chips would be at TSMC, only that some of the eventual package would be... which implies iGPU, to me, and that wouldn't be N2 (possibly N4, since Battlemage is N5, and N4 would be open and cheaper than N3 nodes).  Do you have a source, where they directly claim the NVL cores are coming from TSMC?",Neutral
AMD,"The game is a dumpster fire when it comes to CPU utilization, it hammers even top tier gaming chips like the 9800X3D. I'm not surprised if the E cores can bottleneck the performance even further, most likely some of the game's heaviest threads get (wrongly) assigned to the E cores.    The scheduling in W11 has been significantly improved over the last few years but it's not 100% perfect either. Legacy software in particular, which typically utilizes 1 core, often ends up running in an E core and as a result you can't take advantage of the higher ST performance a P core provides. In that case you need stuff like Process Lasso to fix the problem. It doesn't happen very often but when it does it's very annoying.",Negative
AMD,"Yup.   >. Then as you look forward, to our next-generation product for client after that, Nova Lake will actually have die both inside and outside for that process. So, you'll actually see compute tiles inside and outside.  Q4 2024 earnings call.",Neutral
AMD,"That seems really strange, since ARL was designed for both 18A and N3, and they just went with N3 at the time.  Now that 18A is ready, and capacity is reserved for Intel themselves, you'd think NVL would just plain be fabbed there.  Maybe the 18A fabs are so busy with Clearwater Lake orders, that they would go with TSMC again?  That seems like something they couldn't have known in 2024.",Neutral
AMD,"18A is about as good clockspeed as N2, but density is still around N3 level. To make a new architecture, it makes sense for them to target N2 if AMD does the same which they have",Neutral

AMD,Will it also introduce Lunar Lake successor?,Neutral
AMD,I wonder if this could become avaliable on LGA 1954 because that'd be a good alternative for budget builds potentially if the iGPU is potent enough.,Positive
AMD,I would love to see a Nova Lake-A (strix halo like) APU with an 8+16 tile + 20Xe3 cores which is equal to 2560 FP32 lanes or 40 AMD CU's with 16-32mb of memory side cache to handle igpu bandwidth demands,Positive
AMD,Is anyone left?,Neutral
AMD,"Wonder what node such a product, if it does exist, would use for the iGPU tile.   AFAIK, rumor is that the iGPU tile for the standard parts would be on 18A or an 18A variant. However, if this is a flagship part, I would assume they would be willing to pay the extra cost to use N2...   However that would also presumably involve porting the architecture over to another node, which I don't think Intel has the resources, or wants to go through the effort, to do so.   Also wonder if such a product will finally utilize the ADM cache that has been rumored since like, forever.   And this is a bit of a tangent, but I swear at this point in the leak cycle for a new Intel product, there's always usually a ton of different skus that are leaked that may or may not launch - right now we have NVL bLLC, NVL standard, and now this, and a bunch of them end up not launching (whether they were cut internally, or the leaks were just made up). So it would be pretty interesting to see if any of the more specialized rumored NVL skus end up actually launching.",Neutral
AMD,These designs are going to be the go-to for creator and mid-range gaming at some point in the future. Having it all integrated together should provide opportunities for optimization and form factors that are difficult with discrete cards,Neutral
AMD,How long do I have to wait for something that is more powerful than an AMD 7840HS and still cheaper?,Neutral
AMD,Good to hear! I have a strix halo asus tablet the 390 one and its only got 32GB ram but its fast!  Would love to see an intel version…,Positive
AMD,"This is great move by Intel since they aren't making dGPU for laptop so they can get some marketshare by making strong Intel ecosystem. If Nova Lake AX released then people don't need to buy overpriced laptop with Nvidia dGPU anymore, not to mention with Nvidia shitty small vram.",Positive
AMD,"I'm still using Alder Lake, I suppose all these chips will be released in 2026 ?",Neutral
AMD,That's Panther Lake in a few months,Neutral

AMD,"No, the memory config wouldn't work.",Neutral
AMD,"That isn't that different from the AI MAX 395+ already released, which has 16 Zen 5 cores and 40CUs and some MALL cache (I think 20MB) to help with bandwidth.  For this to be a meaningful upgrade, you'd want more than 20 Xe3 cores, which means you need more bandwidth, which means you need probably LPDDR6 memory to get it high enough as otherwise the cache demands would be prohibitive and LPDDR6 memory isn't coming to client until probably 2027.",Neutral

AMD,"Unless they can find some way to bring down the cost.....these aren't gonna get much traction, the same applies to Strix Point of course. While more efficient than your typical 2000$ laptop with a decent GPU.....the traditional laptop is still gonna outperform them based on pure specs.  You get more battery hour and less heat but people who use these kind of laptop are used to having it plugged 24/7. Feels more like experimental models but they have a long way to go before they see proper adoption. Particularly the cost.",Negative
AMD,"> mid-range gaming  Strix halo is only in $2000 systems. high end price, mid-range performance.  Good for stock margins i guess.",Positive
AMD,I'm sure that Xe2 in Lunar Lake is faster than the 7840HS iGPU on average if you run it with the max performance mode in the OEM software that comes with your laptop.,Positive
AMD,The 7850HS can't compete with the Xe2 igpu because it's bandwidth starved.   The 8mb of memory side cache insulating the 4mb of L2 from main memory allows the Xe2 Arc 140V igpu in LL clocked at 1950mhz to beat the RDNA 3.5 890m clocked at 2950mhz as it only has 4mb of L2 as a last level of cache before hitting memory.   TLDR: RDNA 3.5 is bandwidth starved on strix point due to lacking memory side cache,Neutral
AMD,PTL's not really a LNL successor.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, it was just to prove a point that ARM is overrated.",Neutral
AMD,What about an 8 + 16 big LLC tile and 32Xe3 cores (4096 FP32 lanes or ~60 AMD CU's) + 64mb of memory side cache?   Or even better a mid range part with an 8+16 tile and 16-20Xe3 cores + 16-32mb of memory side cache,Neutral
AMD,Just read about the JEDEC spec for lpddr6 of 14400mt/s.  That is wild!,Neutral
AMD,"I hear you, questioning my decision to return under Pat’s hire-back spending spree. Dodged this one… but this is hitting differently.",Neutral
AMD,Who said it's It's entirely TSMC ? they have been pretty open about majority of tiles Intel the CPU Tile will be shared with N2 ofc though,Neutral
AMD,"It should be Intel here, TSMC there.  Or a little bit of Intc, a little bit of TSMC.",Neutral
AMD,IDM 2.0: Where we proudly declare our fabs are world-class—while quietly handing the crown jewels to TSMC.,Neutral
AMD,Source?,Neutral
AMD,"The BOM is lower, so the question is where the markup is coming from.",Neutral
AMD,Consoles have big APUs and they have better value than anything. I know they're subsidized however.,Positive
AMD,A mid range Nova Lake-A SKU with a 6+12 tile and 16/20Xe3 cores with 16-32mb of memory side cache would be sick,Neutral
AMD,Thats the problem with AMD sticking an additional 8 cores instead of infinity cache to fix the bandwidth bottleneck.,Negative
AMD,>still cheaper,Neutral
AMD,"It's the closest that we will get to a Lunar Lake successor   Really, panther lake is a combined successor to both Arrow Lake-H and Lunar Lake",Neutral
AMD,"Low volume and a giant chip package most likely. That GPU tile is going to be expensive. Look at Strix Halo for reference.  Combine that with not moving a lot of them compared to the rest of the lineup, and each one of those units has to make up more of the costs from things like bad dies or general spin up costs for a new chip.",Negative
AMD,It already has 32MB infinity cache.,Neutral
AMD,The 7840HS is cheaper because it is older.,Neutral
AMD,"It competes in the U/H lanes, so what is today ""ARL""-U and ARL-H. But yes, in practice it should bring *most* of the LNL goodness over, but PTL-U is still not a true successor in the original ~10W envelope LNL was designed for.",Neutral
AMD,"> and a giant chip package most likely. That GPU tile is going to be expensive. Look at Strix Halo for reference   It's no bigger than the equivalent dGPU, and you save on memory, package, and platform costs. Half the point of these things is to use the integrated cost advantage to better compete with Nvidia dGPUs.",Negative
AMD,The new Ryzen AI 250/260 with 780M is still cheaper because it doesn't have copilot+ .,Neutral
AMD,I will see the performance envelope of PTL U and decide should dump my LNL or not,Neutral
AMD,"The low volume part of that quote is important. If you're making heaps of them, each can take up a little bit of the startup costs for that design. If you only make a few, those costs get concentrated on what you do make.  Low volume also means a single defect is promotionally more of your possible units, and hits the margins harder. You do get more total defects in a larger run, but at sufficiently high quantities of those defects, you start making lower bins to recover some of the defects. If you hardly make the volume to cover one widespread SKU, you aren't likely to have enough to make a cheaper one with any degree of availability. At some point you hit a threshold where it's not worth selling what would be a lower bin because there's not enough of them.",Neutral
AMD,Because putting a 40 TOPs NPU for the Copilot+ certification is costly.,Neutral
AMD,"It doesn't have a 40 TOPS NPU, it's the same 16TOPS one in the 8840HS it's literally just another rebrand. It's cheap because it's from 2023.",Neutral
AMD,Exactly. Hence your Xe2 lunar lake being faster is irrelevant to the question because it won't be cheaper regardless of age when they have a NPU that takes close to 1/3 of die space.,Negative
AMD,I think I didn't say anything that deviates from what you just said.,Neutral
AMD,"Maybe I misread or misunderstood, I thought you said the 260/250 had a 40TOPS NPU",Neutral
AMD,enjoy rhythm aware outgoing practice bike attempt library versed cake   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*,Neutral
AMD,Haha wow that is hilariously bad.   And here I thought ASUS newer bios update was bad due to some higher temps,Negative
AMD,"The new Gigabyte BIOS also has booting issues for me, and memory is even more unstable.  At least the UI is entirely in English now.",Negative
AMD,"who needs quality control, what can go wrong?",Negative
AMD,Gigabyte is trash,Negative
AMD,The Elon Musk method,Neutral
AMD,"> “Yeah just push it to production nothing’s gonna happen, no need to QA/QC this”  Seems to be the motto of a lot of the tech world",Negative
AMD,"Yup indeed.   I would even go as far as one full month   Hence, why I learned to avoid installing new Windows Update automatically",Neutral
