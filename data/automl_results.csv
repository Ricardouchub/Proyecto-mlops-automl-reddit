Intel,"call it what it is, its a smoothing technique not a frame multiplier",Neutral
Intel,Can't even read it because it requires either accepting the tracking cookies or paying for the subscription so basically it's behind the paywall.,Negative
Intel,"I don’t understand frame generation, it’s always feels sloppy and laggy. I have never encountered a game where it was beneficial. I have 144hz monitor, so if generate from 60, or 30, it’s all shit. If generate from 144 fps, to 300, it’s looks better, but feels much worse.   “300 000 000 fps by the press if a button, but it still feels like 30”",Negative
Intel,The downside is a game has to support XeSS 2. That's an extremely short list!,Negative
Intel,people spend hundreds on a high end 1ms response monitor then turn on framegen and add back like 100ms of delay like gg,Negative
Intel,"downvoted due to referring as simply ""3x FPS"".",Neutral
Intel,3x the frames but they all suck!,Negative
Intel,Its way better then lsfg though. Xell helps with latency a TON. Makes it actually usable imo,Positive
Intel,Those blur the UI which is awful,Negative
Intel,"LSFG is software. It is not a hardware accelerated technique, like shader models and tesselation. It is not slated to be incorporated at API level in DirectX. Stop pushing this crap.

Intel,"""internet you will disagree you will piss and moan in the comments all day you will cry about it scream about it go on Twitter and write it no no no and then you go to buy your Nvidia card..."" Gordon  There are several camps, ""Nvidia is marketing fg/mfg as ""performance"" which upsets people""  ""Those features are going to cause devs to stop optimizing (because somehow although nvidia/amd recommend \~60fps first), devs are going to push 35fps to 140"" Average r/pcmasterrace  or ""I hated because its hardware locked, I deserve access to it because I bought nvidia all my life, why dont they offer lower version (Its 100% possible)?",Negative
Intel,"It's because it's supported on the older a  and b series as well, and not locked to pather lake only. If nvidia supported the full mfg on the 4000 series I think it wouldn't have been much push back, shoot maybe even the 3000 series.",Neutral
Intel,"The limitations of this tech are generally understood now. People felt lied to when Nvidia debuted this feature, because they said that it would double your framerate, and you can feel that that's not quite what's happening (input latency likely goes up instead of down). And, to their credit, I think Intel has even described it as ""frame smoothing,"" which is way closer to the truth than Nvidia has gotten.",Negative
Intel,"Two things are important here.  1. Intel giving mfg to older gen cards as well when amd and nvidia didn't.  2. Intel never marketed mfg as ""fps gainer"" thing, only a frame smoother thing. I watched intel engineer interview with digital foundry guy he clearly say this.",Neutral
Intel,"The way they advertise it is super different, way less scummy than Nvidia. Intel is pretty transparent in their marketing whenever it’s used, they always provide performance numbers without frame generation and treat FG as an optional extra, versus Nvidia who’ll always use it if they can and obfuscate its usage when it is.",Neutral
Intel,"most probably people are still mad about ""5070 = 4090""",Negative
Intel,Please find the slide where Intel says that a 5060 = 4090...,Neutral
Intel,most people have actually used it by now and understand it's applications.,Neutral
Intel,Has Intel really “used it for marketing slides against AMD without FrameGen”? I thought those slides were FrameGen vs FrameGen and Native vs Native.,Neutral
Intel,"Because they claimed 5070 was hitting 4090 performance due to MFG, which just invites ridicule.",Negative
Intel,"Is there pushback? I find Nvidia's framegen to be way better than anything else. And it sucks because handhelds are the ones that would benefit the most from it, FSR4 is really meh compared.",Negative
Intel,"You don't have to pay anything, just accept and have fun.",Positive
Intel,Okay. thats fine.,Positive
Intel,Just open it up in an incognito window and accept? That's what I do with most random links.,Neutral
Intel,"It's very much not obvious, but with frame gen both the starting framerate and game can massively affect the result.   Worst case turning on FGx2 can almost double your latency, though around 30-50% is typical. Not an issue if you're running closer to 100 FPS to start with, but if the game has relatively high latency and you're limited to 144 Hz it can feel flat out worse. 3x or 4x, wouldn't bother without a 240 Hz+ monitor.",Negative
Intel,"The difference in latency between 144 and 300 fps is extremely small. It might not make sense in competitive fps games. But in a lot of games, it just makes sense.   And the difference in latency between games and controllers is already much bigger.",Neutral
Intel,Something's wrong with your setup. FG and MFG works great on my 360Hz OLED monitor.,Negative

Intel,"Yeah, I know it isn't the same. My problem was more the title and not the technology",Negative
Intel,"no framegen is usable, i have tried it on 50 series gpus even at 120 fps and you turn on framegen you can tell shit is delayed, keep turning it on though makes it easier to get frags for me",Negative
Intel,I wouldn't recommend using 20x either. It was just me saying the title is stupid,Negative
Intel,"1. I used it as example on why using the FPS multiplier is a stupid way to measure it      2. LSFG has a lower cost on system resources in my experience than FSR Frame gen      3. It works for nearly every game and nearly every GPU, means you can even use it on an RX 480     4. It works well. Yes it isn't perfect because it also uses frame gen on stuff like the HUD and so on, but it still gives a rather smooth experience      5. Nobody is talking about it being a replacement to in game FG",Neutral
Intel,"> ""Nvidia is marketing fg/mfg as ""performance"" which upsets people""  Notably Intel's Tom Peterson seemed to echo that opinion when DF interviewed him a month or two ago.",Neutral
Intel,Ya i cant believe my 3080 didnt get the basic fg. I already upgraded to the 3080 for better dlss and then was instantly told I cant hVe fg either.,Negative
Intel,Likely?  Input latency goes up,Neutral
Intel,"Consciously ignoring the ""this is impossible without AI statement"" that was said immediately after",Negative
Intel,I don't think you'll find a slide where Nvidia said the 5060 beats a 4090,Neutral
Intel,"There was one slide where it was frame gen against native, where Intel advertised that with MFG, the maximum possible output was XXX better",Neutral
Intel,"Incognito doesn't stop data collection, it literally says so when you open a private window in most browsers. It's just so you don't save cookies or that it doesn't show up in your browser history.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, another sneaky thing I never see mentioned is that mfg also lowers base fps by like 10%+",Negative
Intel,20x sounds like a neat idea for a challenge playthrough of your favourite game.,Positive
Intel,"5. What? Everyone is misled. The entire ""need to cap fps"" is because of this stupid program! It's preventing proper information from reaching people. People are using this over dlss fg and you see posts everywhere.   I do own it. It's not bad for what it is, but its gonna suck on a 480. Need to move forward. Smooth motion blows this out of the water too.",Negative
Intel,"The tech is going to create a lot of problems for reviewers soon. They used to somewhat avoid incorporating dlss in reviews, but its gotten to good stage & frankly ue5 games by default makes people upscale. 4x is already ""funny"" to use cant imagine 6x.  Honestly it makes low end cards bit tricky to criticize. ""bad gen-gen uplift, 8gb vram, but if u optimize + upscaling + fg/mfg, you get 200+fps"" The average watcher will be like what? 200+fps??",Negative
Intel,"But 30 series was never promised or got any ""better dlss""?",Negative
Intel,I think it's really neat how my 4090 is missing a function that's available on the $400 5060...,Positive
Intel,One good thing about frame gen is that it forces the addition of reflex. Frame Gen + reflex can be better than native fps without reflex.  Of course native + reflex is the best option if you value latency above all else.,Positive
Intel,"If you care about Latency, then you should buy an Nvidia card.  Dlss frame gen in a game means reflex WILL be there too. And that allows Nvidia cards to have lower latency despite having lower fps.  Here is what DF showed.  https://youtu.be/MnCHHSwa7R4?si=SDwuGtSbOHOIVO2h&t=4260  5070 - 37 fps - 53.2 ms  9070 - 43 fps - 63.2 ms",Neutral
Intel,"""The RTX 5070: 4090 performance at $549""   Jensen's caveat statement was still deceptive because interpolated frames are not performance. It was the icing on the cake of the least exciting new generation in a long time. In the past we've gotten 70 series cards that competed with previous gen flagships. This gen the 80 series doesn't even come close to beating it. The 5070 is neck and neck with the 4070 Ti so they knew they had to spin some narrative.",Negative
Intel,"Oh my bad, it wasnt the 5060, it was the 5070.... such a big difference...

Intel,"Yeah, that is also something I weirdly never see being talked about. In my experience, LSFG is also lighter than AMDs Frame gen, to a point where I would rather play something like Spider-Man 2 with lsfg, than with in game Frame gen",Neutral
Intel,If you like pain yes    I think LSFG also caps on your screens refresh rate and then just lowers your FPS. Means a whole 12 FPS,Neutral
Intel,"Wasn't smooth motion only for RDNA3+? Plus for people that use Linux (including the steam deck, although I wouldn't use it on the LCD) wouldn't have access to it either way      I will be honest, I also used it over FSR Frame gen in Spiderman 2, because with FSR FG I felt a noticeable dip in FPS and smoothness, while it still looked perfectly fine with lsfg-vk and it ran smoothly. At that moment it was a better option for me, not in general but for me   It is also not preventing proper information from reaching people, that is what the news reporter and marketing departments do by themselves. It is their fault that people think of frame gen as something amazing that fixes everything. Not LSFG. LSFG is just a tool that helps people to maybe keep their device longer",Neutral
Intel,It made people better now that they know to care about frame pacing and latency too,Positive
Intel,Well deserved. Burn them all down. Let people find out things on their own.,Negative
Intel,I have a 4k/120 and I don’t need more than 110-120 fps. I refuse to use frame gen,Negative
Intel,I mean sure. Doesnt change the fact its scummy behavior. Nvidia makes sure every single new Gen now isnt compatible with the previous one.  At a certain point sure. But when the 4080 released my 3080 should be able to do all the same things just slowly... its wild that even my old 1070ti could do everything AMD cards can lol and my 3080 can too but yet not Nvidia.,Negative
Intel,"If latency was so important, then it would be front and center of benchmarks instead of 0.1% lows",Neutral
Intel,"Then directly be angry at what you are really angry about. No one wanted the trash N3B node except Intel and Apple (who both flopped with it relatively speaking), N3E was not ready in time, so Nvidia made do with a refined architecture on same node and created MFG to try to push the subjective experience in a way the hardware could not.  But really,  despite widespread criticism based on latency, how many actually put active testing on latency and FPS with 5070 MFG vs 4090 except DF at launch? BTW, pretty interesting, DF says it's in between 4080S and 4090, but more like 4080S when all factors are taken into account.   Also, how many use latency even today, when making say, a 9070 vs 5070 comparison video? Or even benchmarking games. You said it's important right? That's why 5070=4090 is so bad right?",Negative
Intel,It was a joke based off your typo,Negative
Intel,Even Firefox doesn't stop data collection from Firefox itself.,Neutral
Intel,"Smooth motion is nvidias ""lsfg"" that employs tensor cores.",Neutral
Intel,Reviewers don't factor in Nvidia's Reflex vs non reflex when comparing cards (at native or upscaled) though. It seems like latency only matters while complaining about Frame Generation.,Negative
Intel,"That is the beauty, dont use it. Everyone happy",Positive
Intel,"There's nothing scummy about it. You just don't realize that ""my card can technically do it, but more slowly"" negates the whole point of tech that improves performance.  If you lose more FPS by turning on FG than you get from it, what's the point?  Also, DLSS 4.5 literally came to all RTX cards, so you're just flat wrong.",Negative
Intel,"I'm not defending their scummy behavior, I'm pointing out that if you wanted something other than performance (and good performance/$, albeit with a crippled vram) from 30 gen, you made it up in your head. That is all.",Negative
Intel,Well then there is also only a limited amount of people that have access to that. So LSFG can be used in the other use cases,Neutral
Intel,the little df clip video covering reflex recently is crazy. i did not realize how much it helps despite always using it. ofc it's game by game but it can be drastic reduction in latency while adding fg is really not adding that much. and fg + reflex can still be lower than no reflex no fg lol.   idk why latency is not covered responsiveness is like one of the most important factors to games imo. antilag 2 is in like maybe 10 games this should be pushed more it's literally only nvidia competing when it comes to it. especially since you can inject reflex pretty easily through other means.,Positive

Intel expects their OEMs to have higher PL1 minimum values for balanced mode but MSI set it lower at 15 Watts min and 30 Watts max for at least this laptop model.

Many are firm believers that Intel will finally break the duopoly of AMD and Nvidia and while that may be the case, everyone seems to gloss over the driver side of things, not to mention the massive CPU overhead.   Just yesterday, I was recommended the latest video from YouTuber ""zWORMz"" benchmarking the 'ancient' RDR2 on a B580.  And even on Windows, the guy was frustrated with various driver issues and how the GPU wouldn't even run in his mid-range machine with an i5-12600K. Some issues even popped up right when he was recording.  With that in mind, I can only imagine the experience on Linux!",Neutral
Intel,Should be compared to Strix Halo based on price.   The power consumption does not look all that great:  > The Core Ultra X7 358H came out on a geo mean basis to 1.23x the performance of the Radeon 890M graphics with Strix Halo but at 1.25x the power consumption on average. The peak power consumption was also around 1.25x that of the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. So rather even on a performance-per-Watt basis overall.  Intel has a lot of work to do. 2 nodes advantage and still just matching Strix Point in power efficiency.,Negative
Intel,Semi serious answer probably they're trying to not making raptor lake repeat. On more related to the laptop msi probably trying to win some battery life benchmark or trying to not breaking their laptop chassis and components quickly because of heat.,Neutral

In my case I have a Framework 13 with the Intel Core Ultra 5 125H (Meteor Lake) and the Arc (Alchemist) 7-core iGPU, and I can't get a stable 60fps on Forza Horizon 5 no matter what I do, even disabling every graphical effect possible and dropping the resolution to 1024x768 doesn't work (if anything it's worse since the minimums stay the same so the difference between average and minimum just gets larger and the stutters feel way worse), while the LCD Steam Deck can manage 60fps flat perfectly fine at 1280x800 minimum settings at least, and it sips less power then too (under 15W vs 25W for the Framework), even though the CPU is just Zen2 which shouldn't be faster than the Meteor Lake P-cores, and since it's the LCD version the RAM is just LPDDR5-5500 so memory bandwidth shouldn't be too different from the DDR5-5600 in the Framework 13.",Negative

As for ""can it play all my titles reasonably well"", I don't remember any specific titles that didn't run at all, so I guess the answer is yes? I do remember having tested Oblivion Remastered and Dragon Age Veilguard, both are Steam Deck Verified, and they do indeed run, but it's very much a 30fps experience reliant on FSR to achieve even that, so I'd guess it probably won't handle newer or heavier titles any better. If you have any specific titles you care about I'd suggest checking ProtonDB and filter the reports to just Steam Deck ones to get a picture of how the game might run, and sometimes games are marked unsupported by Valve but does actually run with caveats like input quirks so you'd be able to play if you're fine with those quirks.",Negative

Like you can find Lunar Lake for $500-$600 new these days if you wait for sales and aren't picky about other aspects.

I'm sure most of the last generation IGPUs like the Radeon 880M or 890M are also powerful enough (considering they are faster than the Arc A380).  We've always known that the Forza Horizon games are very well optimized and are able to run on IGPUs just fine. Keep in mind that Forza Horizon 5 runs just fine on the Vega 3 IGPU in the 7 year old AMD Athlon 3000G.  The article is presenting the trivial fact that the B390 is listed as the minimum spec for the upcoming Forza Horizon 6 as somehow being a huge win for Intel. That's not very good journalism. It was going to run on IGPUs regardless of whether or not the B390 existed.,Neutral

Also buyers should be careful because not every laptop presented has the power and thermals set to permit full power sustained boosting at the wattages tested in the reviews.   Those laptops should get cheaper and so on of course. Right now we don’t know. A Dell XPS costs more than a new mid-range MacBook Pro though, that is steep.",Negative

Intel,"Why not? Microsoft announced it like it's an official console, shouldn't their first party studios support it then?",Neutral
Intel,"Probably two main reasons off the top of my head: the Xbox Ally released quite late in this console cycle and it's very weak. There already exists a large library of games that would not be playable and Microsoft suddenly (drastically) lowering the minimum target would be messy for devs. Even the Series S can barely do raytracing effects, for example. [Microsoft maintains a compatibility list](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/handhelds/handheld-compatibility) much like Valve with the Steam Deck.  Maybe things change with the next gen if Microsoft brings out a first party handheld, but for now it's just a bonus if runs on the Ally.",Negative

Four generations of NVidia, three generations of AMD in, it's still incredibly difficult to find a game where the ray tracing is visible without a side-by-side screenshot comparison AND where it doesn't make the game look worse. And forcing that setting to ""on"" with certain presets doesn't exactly fix that in any way.

Intel,"They're talking about the A310 and A380, of which Nvidia doesn't have anything made in this decade to compete with and AMD has the 6400 that came out 5 years ago.  The only cards with modern features in that price segment that consumers can directly buy are the A310 and A380.",Neutral
Intel,He(Lucas) stated $100 was the market that was abandoned.  10:37  > Steve: So why still making A310?  > Lucas: Because what's the competitor have? Nvidia? like... GT710? GT1030? (laughs) No way. So literally Nvidia AMD already give up the segment of this like... $100 price card.,Neutral
Intel,This guy was talking about the A310 which is a $100 GPU. Basically said that the only other options at that price bracket are either a GT 710 or a GT 1030. And from AMD you can still get an old RX 550. The A310 may be slow but it beats those two gpu's by a mile.,Neutral

Intel,I just wish all of those options were more compelling tbh. I think what Steve was trying to say was that AMD and Nvidia have just half assed that market segment at the expense of the consumer. All these being 8gb cards for $250-$300 is kinda ridiculous in 2026. I’ll take a b580 over a 9060xt 8gb or 5060 any day of the week.,Negative

So you can get B580 for MSRP, but for how long who knows.",Positive
Intel,"die area is not the only cost indicator. B580 actually uses N5 fab, which is likely cheaper than N4, used by 5050. In reality, B580 only has about ~15% more transistors and if we assume N5 is cheaper per transistor and N5 has higher yields (by being more mature) i'd say their die cost might be very similar.  While yes, it has wider memory, the chips are clocked lower, so they can buy slower bins, reducing per chip cost.   B580 has more power draw, which in turn costs more for power delivery and cooling.  All in all, AIB manufacturer likely has lower margin per card as it stands, so i wouldn't be surprised if intel is taking a lower margin on the gpu/gddr combo to get more market share.  Nvidia on the other hand optimized their cost REALLY well, as they have been doing GPUs for almost 30 years.",Neutral
Intel,"Nvidia is getting such good performance out of such a small die because they're the best. Simple as. They've been doing GPU's for decades. It's not unexpected that at this stage Intel needs to use a larger die to match the performance - it would be incredibly surprising if that wasn't the case.  But a small *part* of that die size advantage comes from that narrow 128bit bus, and *part* of B580's appeal is its wider bus and subsequently more VRAM.",Positive

The fact that the causes they support happen to be semi legit and consumer friendly in nature does not take away from the fact that they are essentially drama and negativity for profit at this point, and often out of touch with reality. You can be positive, polite, and have reporting standards while still calling out shitty behavior and ripping bad practices to pieces.   Companies are not your friend. That includes GN. They stoke hardware enthusiast anger for their own gain. Personally i think the harm they do to the space/peoples mentality is farm more than the amount of good most (key word most, fire risks and stuff deserve prompt drama) of their coverage does.   Even this title takes a topic and very educational opportunity to provide actual hardware coverage and immediatly try’s to stoke negative furry about some aspect of the hardware industry. Its just non stop with them. I dont think its healthy for anyone to watch then honestly, which is sad as i used to enjoy their review/news. I hope for their sake they are not actually so perpetually angry and they are doing what they do to knowingly manipulate their audience for increased views/engagement. I cant imagine living life so constantly angry at every possible point over computer hardware, as much as i am saddened by the current state hardware and love gaming.   As tough as it is with rising prices and such and sad to think of what we could have instead, modern hardware, gaming, and such is in a nearly historic good state (realistic cost to perf is probably lowest in history other than brief periods such as the 30 series launch), and is a very cost effective hobby compared with other ones for the time you get out of it. Many great games launch all the time (even if big name traditional games have largely went to trash). They are easier to run with hardware (like the ARC gpu) being quite cheap and capable. People, like GN, need to temper their overexagerated frustration with a dose of real world perspective and objectivity.",Negative

Intel,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310. Almost anything these days is better than an A310.  >  Like the GT710 make no sense nowadays (their last attempt was what, the GeForce GTX 1630?), even though they sold like hotcakes for offices and for people who just wanted HDMI outs.  GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered. GTX 1630 was okay but it was supposed to be $149 USD MSRP and it came out for like $200 USD in most stores due to GPU shortage at the time, not much NVIDIA could really do about that.",Neutral

Relying on the Strix Halo is not an option here.  It's pretty much impossible to find a good laptops that use it.  The upcoming HX470, and still without FSR4, isn't going to close the apparent large gap.  It seems that AMD forgot to stay hungry and they'll end up losing whatever ground that they'd gained in the last few years.

The only aspect Intel kind of messed up that annoys me is their video encoder, once it gets pegged to 100%, it absolutely tanks your performance on the capture to the point where it skips frames and lags. It never used to do that and the driver also used to include capture software, now they just offload it to people having to download OBS and removed the capture aspect of the driver.

Intel,"They announced a first party Strix Halo PC at CES, but it'll probably be really expensive.",Neutral
Intel,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips.

But who can resent them as Intel had products that where not so much competitive that time.    Arrow lake (Desktop) at least closed on efficiency, but lacks a bit of gaming performance still, hopefully Nova Lake will be the step required to push more competition.   On GPU the same, AMD does not compete with NVIDIA in higher segments while NVIDIA is fairly comfortable with their setup and increases prices because they want to milk customers to increase their ridiculious margins (up to 70%) that they are used to from AI-Chips.   And now Intel also provides Multi-Frame generation, while a niche for me still, starting to compete with AMD and closes up to NVIDIA in terms of Software support, which they lacked the most and fixes a lot of problems.

Intel,"I got downvoted everytime I brought this up, but this is precisely why Nvidia wanted a deal to have an Nvidia iGPU tile on an Intel APU: Large iGPUs in thin and lights are going to get good enough over the next few years to make them the new entry-level graphics option for people. This directly threatens Nvidia's consumer laptop volume in the entry segment. Intel is claiming close to 4050 performance at this lower TDP, and that's certainly good enough for many to not have the tradeoffs of having a dGPU in their laptop.  If the new market is moving towards putting GPUs on the CPU package instead of discretely on the board, Nvidia doesn't want to place all of their hopes on WoA becoming better, and are hedging by doing both their own SoC *and* an x86 APU with Intel.  The XPS line dropping Nvidia discrete all together is proof of this. In these sub 70W total laptop power markets, a discrete GPU is just eats into the power budget too much.",Neutral
Intel,"In the ultraportables market (like XPS), integrated graphics just make so much sense (energy envelope; cooling system required; battery life; etc); and that's already substantial and before considering the cost of a NVIDIA mobile dGPU itself.

Intel,??? lunar lake has already shown to be faster than the 890m.  73 percent though seems like a bit much since panther lake was claimed to be around a 50 percent increase over lunar lake,Neutral
Intel,"They did make a graph specifically to compare the performance of HX 370 and this Arc B390 while they were both using 2x upscaling, which is where this 73% number comes from.

Intel,"No, intel claims 73% with upscaling (both) and 82% native",Neutral

Intel,"The graphs all listed games and I didn't see any synthetic benchmark scores were listed, so yeah.",Neutral
Intel,The relative proportion of the die isn't as important as the die size itself and the node ofc.   Lunar lake for example has an estimated die size smaller than the hx370 so even if they did make the die bigger I don't think that is going to massively raise the price. Not to mention intel owns the foundry unlike AMD who are outsourcing to TSMC. This isn't in the realm of a strix halo competitor with a 300 mm\^2 + die size.   Dell for example has already refreshed the XPS line with intel panther lake and cut out the option for a dedicated gpu.,Neutral

Intel,AMD is planning on again using RDNA 3.5 on their next mobile chips as well.,Neutral
Intel,Not an ideal solution but Optiscaler exists,Negative
Intel,"NVIDIA has increased margins but they haven't been that terrible. Part of the compounding issue at play is limited TSMC capacity; with both gaming and DC on the same TSMC node.

Intel,Who said anything about basing the entire product stack around handhelds?,Neutral
Intel,"That's not quite right. Power levels are determined by the frequency of a given CPU core. The LPE cores in Lunar and Panther lake both clock up to 3.7 GHz, so given the added IPC of the new Panther lake e-cores and better process node, it is more efficient.

Intel,Xe3p was alr confirmed coming im sure Celestial happens,Neutral
Intel,"We will see, while Intel's PR and marketing is extremely confusing, Intel did confirm Xe3P will come to desktop; and at least from driver updates (as a very happy B580 owner) driver support has been constant and lively.

Dunno if they read those reports, but my card keeps getting better.

Intel,That's bloody good for an iGPU. It's been nice to see them finally get to respectable performance over the last few years. Intel in particular has really upped their iGPU game & it shows.,Positive
Intel,not to mention it is a little skewed as they threw in a title which pushed the vram limit on the 4050 making the b390 over 800 percent faster in that title which obviously messes with the average.,Negative
Intel,It's 10% faster geomean across 45 games,Positive
Intel,That can be resolved if either Intel or AMD decides to unlock quad-channel on consumer chips and mobos. It's artificial market segmentation; the die area needed to deliver more (LP)DDR5 channels is absolutely minuscule; for a huge boost in iGPU performance.,Neutral
Intel,Cache. Lots of it.,Neutral
Intel,"They are using 9600mt/s lpddr5x, could also have a lot of cache, (iirc 890m configs were nerfed in cache because they wanted to put a npu instead), and also could be a synthetic benchmark or specific game that isn't very bandwidth heavy.",Neutral
Intel,Panther Lake still has a 128 bit memory bus so only models with 9600 mt/s will get slightly faster shared memory bandwidth than Lunar Lake.   I wonder how this will manifest in games as the only performance leaks have been from Geekbench and 3DMark which may not be as bandwidth intensive as real games and applications.,Neutral
Intel,"This seems to be correct, since checking NotebookCheck for the 30 watt 4050 shows that it’s around 70% faster than the HX370 in games, which is roughly where Intel places their iGPU.  The performance difference between a 30 watt 4050 and full 140 watt 4050 is around 41 percent performance based on Time Spy",Positive
Intel,"basically cheating tho, rtx cards in dell laptops are barely getting enough watts to even turbo",Negative
Intel,"That's the only way to do a fair comparison, really.   Because the 45 watts that Intel chip uses is shared for the entire chip.   So it's still 45w Intel + igpu vs 60w Intel+gpu",Neutral
Intel,"It’s a super strong generational gain though, it’s like the jump from Vega 8CU to rdna2 12CU. The kind of single gen gain you see once in 5 years at most",Positive
Intel,The thing about that... what sort of tile are we expecting them to package up? As you say if we can get 4050ish performance from an Intel iGPU then they really can't be far off 5050M... and maybe even 5060M performance in future.  Do you think they'll offer something like a 5070 tile? that almost seems excessive (and difficult to actually package from a thermal point of view in a laptop) but it seems like the 5050/5060 sort of tier is going to be pretty well covered as a traditional iGPU soon.,Neutral
Intel,AMD actually introduced lower tier Strix Halos in this CES; and the first budget laptop thats gonna use it is [the Asus TUF A14](https://youtu.be/h27w0PXFBgk?si=Pa7UQhinywF-uFMj&t=306),Positive

Intel,> Lunar Lake was a expensive product which didn't make sense in handhelds   What do you mean? All the tradeoffs LNL made were pretty good fits for a handheld.,Neutral
Intel,"I don't think that will really be an issue, laptops can be configured with soldered 8 channel RAM like AMDs Z2 extreme, or they can still manage easily with regular DDR5 6400Mhz sodimms, which run at 102.4GB/s  Plus the CPUs that have intels new B390 iGPU are 4P/8E CPUs, so I doubt there will be much issues from low ram speeds.

Intel,"Different poster than OP.  Compute tile on Lunar Lake is 140mm2 on N3E with a small 46mm2 controller N6 tile. Strix Point (HX 370) as a whole is 233 mm2 on N4P. Lunar Lake is clearly cheaper, but given the newer node and packaging not massively so, likely by around 20-25%.  Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins. For all purposes it's an accounting trick to hide CCG's and DCAI's 5-15% operating margins if you divide the foundry losses per group revenue.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, although the actual low power 8 core successor to Lunar Lake is the 335/365 with half GPU cores and slower RAM.",Neutral
Intel,"even if you exclude the CPU CCDs the graphics die alone is bigger than a RTX 5070Ti mobile GPU, which also retails for \~$2000-$3000, same as Strix Halo laptop",Neutral
Intel,"This is slightly splitting hairs but the 8c CCDs in Strix Halo is actually NOT the same chiplet as the ones in desktop zen 5 parts. It iirc is produced on a smaller node, slimmed down, and has different ( or no) TSVs.  It is similar to design and cache sizes to desktop however, but the changes to the CCDs were done to improve low power performance characteristics. They are likely a bit more expensive than Desktop CCDs.  I believe it is discussed in a chips&cheese deep dive.",Neutral
Intel,"AMD have largely been ""winning by doing nothing"" due to their better driver support stack for gaming on iGPUs, rather than actually throwing superior hardware at it.  It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.  Given how effective DLSS is on the Switch2, one could only imagine how kickass a Nvidia chip in a handheld PC could be with the far more ubiquitous DLSS support.",Neutral
Intel,Now they are not. The panther lake igpus are undisputed winners (excluding the 395+ from amd since it's just not gonna be mainstream). You can get a 358H or 368H and you'll have solid laptop for igpu gaming far cheaper than the 395+,Positive

Intel,"Well you said it, it's TSMC capacity, meaning also a priority issue. They prioritize AI over consumers and then increase the price by reducing availability, meaning the same chip costs more, meaning more margin.  Seeing they increase the 5090 to roughly 5k (USD) is just the beginning and as I know all companies will use the increasing memory prices to say they must increase the product price, just not proportional to the memory costs.  next step: then they will use this to move more to streaming instead of owning",Neutral

A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.  Sorry for the rambling.",Neutral

Intel,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW? But yeah high end perf scaling falls apart at sub 4K internal res.",Negative
Intel,"I dont think much can be done with overhead. AMDs overhead is already small, basically letting the API go directly to GPU as it is. While for Nvidia side, isnt most of the overhead related to how Nvidia handles DX12? in that case i dont see it going away for a long time.",Negative

Plenty of content he could have farmed off that, especially BEFORE the RAM shortage where having an 8GB card was some sort of sin in his eyes (except for some reason he ignored it but raile roaded the cheaper RTX 5050, lol did someone say bias?). Instead, he just tore the 9060 XT 8GB down and never touched it again after that teardown. I'm sorry but there's GENUINELY stuff he could be doing instead of farming clicks about 'NVIDIA bad' and 'Intel pathetic', but that won't get him views from drama farming NVIDIA which is what he craves these days. So sad to see a big channel like his who got big off doing solid technical content become a drama-hype ""news"" channel.",Negative

Intel,"I was in a similar situation and I went b580 since the price difference was just too high, I have no problem with the card and I play everything I want in 1440p. It really depends, if you have to save money for a bit then it becomes complicated since there's no guarantee prices won't hike up again, but if you can afford it now then go 9060xt, it will last you longer even though it's more expensive.

If it was MSRP right now, would you buy it? If yes, you should just pay more, if you can afford it. You already know what you want, buy it.

Intel,"Which Ryzen 5 and which Arc? I'm assuming it's a Ryzen 5 5500 and Arc A750, but the Ryzen will offer a lot more of a performance increase than just a GPU upgrade.

PSU needs to be compatible but it's not too difficult, just hope it isn't dodgy.  I know OP didn't ask for this and I'm not sure when the initial PC was bought for 320$, but unless the power supply and case are very convincingly modern/expensive, I'm sorry to say you were scammed.  There is a chance of picking up an i7 2600k or 2700k for 10 bucks and overclocking it on top for a performance uplift as well. Getting a gtx1080 level card would still be okay with such a CPU. Just that within the budget for upgrades that was mentioned it doesn't make sense to keep most parts if deals can be had.",Neutral
Intel,yup. dis is da wei. CPU upgrade first before GPU upgrade if budget is an issue. also sometimes a GPU upgrade also means a PSU upgrade.,Neutral
Intel,After you upgrade the mobo and cpu the GPU will be an easy enough upgrade by comparison.   I suggest going with a good AMD(Radeon) gpu option because they offer good price to performance  and there are a lot of good budget options and if you go higher on budget youll get better performance from AMD vs NVIDIA typically at your price range. If you are spending less than 600 on a gpu i cant in good conscious recommend NVIDIA.,Positive

Intel,the 5050 and 5060 are priced at basically the same pont where im at so id never consider a 5050 however id still go with a b580 over a 5060 because of the 12 GB Vram same goes for the RX 7600,Neutral
Intel,Wait and get a 5060 if you can otherwise the 5050.,Neutral
Intel,"Save for the 9060XT, even the 8GB version is over 30% faster than any of these, apart from when everything but the B580 runs out of vram due to its 4GB extra. However the B580 also has CPU overhead issues (Intel has it worst, then Nvidia, and AMD has the least overhead).",Positive
Intel,B580 easily of the options you have shown.  If you can save a little more the 9060XT is a great 1080p-1440p card.,Positive
Intel,"New cards make little sense at this price point, look for good deals on used market instead.",Negative
Intel,"Depends on the price. Are you in the USA?  B580 might not perform well with your 5500 cpu  I would go 7600, they were available for less than $200 but I don't know recent pricing.  If I was going to spend $200 on a video card I would go 3070 all day. Get one on ebay with their guarantee.",Neutral
Intel,"For $250-300 which is average price for these cards I would look for a used card like a 3070ti/3080 or 7700xt, yes it's overkill for the r5 5500 but that means you won't need to upgrade as soon. Plus if you have a 650w good quality psu it should be plenty for these cards",Neutral

Intel,Used RTX 3080 for ~$300,Neutral
Intel,"I think focusing on a GPU upgrade is smart. If you want to go with new components, I think you need to decided if you spend $250 to get a solid upgrade, and pocket the $100 for other stuff; or spend $350 and get an ever better GPU upgrade, but then have spent it all. Used market could really help.here, or it could be bust, that's just the nature of things. A B350 is tempting, if you are sure it's driver splay nicely with your games (IIRC, Intel.GPUs had the most compatibility issues with older games, which matches your game list, idk, maybe these have been resolved). Talking new: at the $250 end you have the B350 and the RTX5050; you then can take a step up to the 9060xt and rtx5060, but that gets you closer to $350 and starts presenting vram questions.   CPU; idk, I think I would want to upgrade to an 8 core, and a 5700x is in your budget, but can't really fit in with a GPU also. Probaly best to focus on GPU first.",Positive
Intel,"After looking at a lot of options, I'm strongly considering an XFX 6650 xt for 300ish, and then saving up to upgrade the CPU to a 5700 series. Thoughts on this approach?",Neutral
Intel,"B580 is an awesome choice, but you would definitely have to upgrade to a better cpu and a 5600 is $180 on amazon right now, same price as a Ryzen 5 9600x unfortunately.   Honestly I would go with a 5060 Ti 8gb for now. As much hate as the 8gb card gets it will be an awesome upgrade over the RX 480 and you wouldn’t have to upgrade your cpu to get the most out of it",Positive
Intel,"Hit the marketplace for a 1660 super ($40-60) and save up for a full build. Or go balls deep 9070xt/5070ti and use the rest of the system as a placeholder for a legit gaming rig (9800x3d, 1000w PSU, 32-64gb ddr 5, b850, 5th gen NVME)",Neutral
Intel,"Looks like the 9060 8 gb is right at 350, but 16gb is more like 500.",Neutral
Intel,5600x and 9060xt is your best bet,Neutral
Intel,Since you already have an AM4 mobo the 5600xt makes more sense than getting the 14400 and a new LGA 1700 board. Look into the 5800xt as well.   The 5060 is 20%+ stronger than the b580. I’d rather get the faster card over the extra vram. Since longevity is important to you I would recommend the 9060xt 16GB. It’s the best card of the bunch by far.   I would get the GPU first then upgrade the CPU. I don’t expect the cpu prices to change much.,Positive
Intel,"I built a home server with 32gb ddr4, 5600XT, and a 5060. It games pretty well for what it is. Like others said, a 16gb card is a better idea for long term.   The 5600xt performs great.",Positive
Intel,"First, avoid the 8GB cards. If you want this to last for years, plan ahead with the VRAM. I know you didn't list AAA-titles, but you could catch the GTA6 bug.

One sizable advantage for the 14400f is you can switch to ddr5 without buying a new cpu - just upgrade motherboard and memory.",Neutral
Intel,"Thanks for the input! The 8gb of VRAM on my RX590 probably is the reason it lasted so long, so your advice is well received. So the question now is, would 12gb be enough? Or should I go for the RX 9060 as the definitive pick?   As for the CPU, I've considered i5-12600KF as it was recommended over 14400f, but at €170 (that is without a fan - effectively pushing the price to €200) would it be worthy upgrade over 14400?",Positive
Intel,This is an incredible comment! This could answer at least 30% of the posts on this sub. Top notch 👏.,Positive
Intel,">would 12gb be enough   *I* would go big here, especially as the price difference isn't massive and the performance is so much better. You're not just paying for VRAM, the card is all-around better  >RX 9060*XT 16GB* as the definitive pick?    If I had money to get a new GPU, I'd get the following depending on my budget:  1. 5070ti 2. 9070XT 16GB 3. 9070 16GB 4. 9060XT 16GB 5.

Intel,Have a look into the RX 7600,Neutral
Intel,"I have a very similar use case in my linux build and for it I've chosen sparkle A310. Your particular refresh rate needs would require A380. That said, can't beat these cards for AV1",Positive

Intel,Definitely try find an a380. Similar encode decode with the latest cards and much cheaper.,Positive
Intel,"Thanks to all who took the time to reply. The A380 (or rather: Pro40) was high on my list.  Interestingly, the search results about its support for >60Hz changed dramatically from yesterday into the opposite.  However, over at the intel arc subreddit, there still is a comment about the A380 not supporting 4k refreshrates >60Hz.  I would like to avoid the 5xx Series, A or B, due to their high power consumption. Same is probably true for AMDs 7xxx Series.  Edit: At least for their Pro cards, on their support site, intel reccomends DP40 cables, which are capable of uncompressed 4K at 144HZ.   Next to the already mentioned UBHR10 this will make it most likely worth a try, if I can source a used A380 or Pro40",Positive

Intel,"You can update your bios and then drop any ryzen 5000 series cpu into your current motherboard, so that would likely be the best cost to performance. As you noticed DDR5 is obscenely expensive so you are looking at spending at minumum $400 more to go to am5 vs buying a 5800xt and reusing your current mobo + ram, and thats just for a 7600x build.  My vote is for a 5800xt as the most practical option. Unfortunately it's nearly impossible to get a 5800x3d for a sane price, however if you get really luckey and find one for a good price, any of the 5000x3d varients would be the ideal option imo",Neutral

Intel,"5700X, 5700X3D,5800X, 5800X3D, 5800XT. All of these options are enough for the 5070, and won't cause any bottlenecks. Best part, you don't need new ram and motherboard",Positive
Intel,Define “causing a massive bottleneck”,Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, go shop around at Newegg and MicroCenter. They usually have combo/bundle deals where you can get a new CPU, RAM and mobo for a reasonable price. May as well grab an AM5 B650 combo if you can get one. The 7800X3D can be had in bundles for well below MSRP these days. I'm assuming that you're in the US.  Also, the Intel Core Ultra 7 265K can be had with bundles for pretty cheap too. While X3D is the gaming champ right now, the 265K is still a damn good CPU at the current prices, and usually comes bundled with a Z890 motherboard...which presents an amazing value over MSRP/regular price per item.",Positive
Intel,"Right now, it makes 0 sense to jump to an AM5/DDR5 platform, unless you are going all out for the top of the line build  Just Update your motherboard BIOS and get the best 5000 series Ryzen CPU you can afford (currently the 5800xt seems like the most reasonable option)  After that as a QOL thing Right now you still have a chance to find some ddr4 ram on the used market for not absolutely ridiculous price. You should aim for 32gb (2x16) 3600-3200mhz with the lowest cas latency you can find.  Do not just get an additional random stick(s) of ram, as almost always you will have compatibility problems. Instead, get a full kit from someone and then sell the one you have. That goes for all of the rest of your old components- sell them to get some additional money for your upgrade.   Right now you can get about 120$ for your 2060 and about 80$ for the 3700x according to the average of eBays recently sold listings,   And that is enough to get the 5800xt",Neutral
Intel,"It's a tough one because of the extreme cost of RAM. Trying to balance 'enough performance' at a price point that makes sense is hard nowadays.  Way I see it you have 2 options:  Grab a 5700X/5800X/5800XT and call it a day. 20% more CPU performance for <$200, it's a good value upgrade, but not revelutionary.  Go AM5 with 7800X3D+32GB. Significantly more expensive but a night and day upgrade. Could make an argument that 7600X would be sufficient but that only brings the total cost from ~€890 to ~€760, so the X3D represents better value when you consider total platform cost. Particularly when you compare 5800X to 7600X, they're the same multicore and about 20% different single core but a €500+ difference is just not worth it for similar overall performance.",Neutral
Intel,"Best value option right now is going AM5 with the 7800X3D. Huge FPS uplift thanks to 3D V-Cache and it’ll stay relevant for years.  The 5800X3D makes no sense at that price, 7950X3D is overkill for gaming, and the 7600X will struggle more in CPU-heavy titles.",Positive

Intel,"OP, in addition to the list AstroShade gave you - If you live near a Microcenter, they have an amd bundle where you can get a CPU, Memory and motherboard for cheaper than you can get it separate else where.",Neutral
Intel,"If you’re coming from console and want a really solid gaming PC between about 1000 and 1500, the biggest thing that matters is your graphics card first, then your CPU, then everything else just supports those. For the games you said like Fortnite, CS, and newer shooters, you want high FPS and smooth gameplay, not just pretty graphics, so you don’t need some insane $3000 monster build.  If you were going closer to the lower end around 1000, I’d probably recommend something like a Ryzen 5 7600 for the CPU, an RTX 4060 or RX 7600 for the graphics card, 16GB or ideally 32GB of DDR5 RAM, a 1TB NVMe SSD like a Samsung 980 or WD SN770, a B650 motherboard, a 650 watt power supply from Corsair or EVGA, and just a normal airflow case like a Phanteks or NZXT H5 Flow. That kind of build would absolutely destroy esports games at 1080p and still run most modern games really well. It’s basically the “I just switched from console and want something way better but not crazy expensive” build.  If you land in the middle around like 1200 to 1500 which honestly is the smartest range right now, I’d move to something like a Ryzen 7 7700, then pair that with an RTX 4070 or RX 7800 XT. Keep 32GB DDR5 RAM, still 1TB or 2TB NVMe SSD, same B650, a 750 watt good quality power supply, and a decent air cooler or 240mm AIO. This is where you start getting super high FPS in Fortnite and CS, plus really strong 1440p performance in basically everything. This is the range most serious gamers sit in because it lasts years without feeling slow.",Neutral
Intel,"Yo gotta find everything by yourself, there is too much things to say. When i built my first pc 6month ago, i knew nothing about pc building, i went on a quest to gather every infos on youtube channels and reddit previous reddit post, and after 2month i m fully up to date.  Now is a bad time to build a pc by yourself, as the ram price has skyrocketted, so are the ssd and now gpu.  32Go of ddr5 ram (the last version of ram if you prefer) is now 450USD. So you probably want to buy a prebuild pc or see if anyone is selling an am4 one.  (am5=ddr5=most recent cpu can fit in) (am4=ddr4=previous generation)  With 1k/1k5 you can do a mid range/budget build (depends if you include peripherals in the budget). You ll just have to preoritize fps/dollar value, so go check what fits you the most by going to search for benchmarks on a specific gpu/cpu, also search for the best cpu/gpu combos, you ll eventually get them after some search.  If i can give you some advice for your futur builds, here are some : - When you are done, put your build on pc part picker and see the voltage you need, always take a psu that can handle more than your max voltage (ex: max V=650, take 700/750 or even higher) - Never cheap on screens, i was about to do so for my first build, but in was x10 times worth buying a 240fps oled 2k than the same one in ips, even for 2 or 3 time the price, the value you get from a good screen (especially oled) is so much worth compare to juste getting few more fps (depending on your budget for sure) - Always check compatibilty and lenght of your compenents, don t buy compenents that end up not fiting with your other compenents  If i can advice some channels, i often watch LinuxTechTips, wich do a lot of nerdy reparation stuff, pretty cool to know more about pc building. ZZT is also a great channel for beginners, he vulgarize a lot of things, i started with him, but there is plenty more channel.  Good luck !

Intel,"A Vansuny SSD? That, does not sound very promising to me, and could very likely be the source of your issues. Check task manager, is disk usage 100 percent? If yes, that tells you what you need to know.   Off-brand SSD's have a tendency to work like this. Some of the ones I have tried work EVEN SLOWER than an HDD.",Negative
Intel,did you take the plastic sticker off the heatplate for your water cooler before installing? this kind of sounds like throttling/overheating of cpu to me.     Edit - supply us with pictures of your build. Also download something like HWinfo64 and check your temps,Negative
Intel,"You still haven't mentioned running a real benchmark with hwinfo open to see temps under load. After you confirm temperatures are fine, it really does sound like an SSD issue to me. I built a PC in December, used an ADATA SSD that my retailer recommended, and it was still by-chance faulty. It was dying and exhibited some texture streaming issues and low speed patching. System would seem to lock up.  Run crystal risk info benchmark and verify that your read and write speeds match the expected speeds of the SSD in the M.2 slot its in",Negative
Intel,"Might be stupid question, but did you plug in the waterpump cable in the correct spot? Or at all?",Neutral
Intel,"Bud, i assume u didnt update your bios, because its not just click and install. I had this problem a while ago and i did everything and nothing helped. But i forgot to do the most essential thing and it was bios update.",Negative
Intel,Try doing a prime95 run for about 6 hours. If it stays stable then it should be good. The 5500 is kinda weak these days but still decent,Positive
Intel,"Honestly.. ryzen 5500 is not very fast tho, and i believe what youre experiencing is because its a gen 3 pcie cpu on a gen 4 mobo with a gen 5 gpu.. try changing the pcie mode on the bios to pcie 3 and see if anything improved..",Negative
Intel,Theres gotta be something weird going on like ram not seated fully or maybe plastic still on the CPU cooler when you installed it 😬 if you open tast manager and go to performance is there anything consistently pegging out at 100%? CPU? GPU? Storage? It could point you in the direction to start troubleshooting,Negative
Intel,Very silly question but you do have your drivers installed? Not running some internal graphics driver? Gpu cables plugged in?,Neutral
Intel,Check BIOS idle CPU temp. Maybe issue with the cooler? Run CrystalDiskInfo on the SSD. Your drive might be dying Run Windows Memory Diagnostic. Bad ram maybe?  Try installing Windows on a known good SSD.,Negative
Intel,When you ran the benchmark tests did you open task manager and close as many background tasks as you could? Having background tasks running can lower your scores a bit and make it look like you’re getting sub-standard performance for your specific CPU/GPU when you’re really not.,Neutral
Intel,Are you playing in 1080p?,Neutral
Intel,Did you turn on XMP or whatever the AMD equivalent is called in the BIOS? Wondering if your RAM is running at its default speed. Can check in the Task Manager > Performance > Memory to see what speed the RAM is running at.,Neutral
Intel,"I see most people here are offering hardware related solutions, but could it be software related?  I'm not really tech savvy enough to know exactly whether it could be, but what about excessive bloatware, or a corrupted driver?  I know from experience an Nvidia driver update can absolutely tank performance and make games almost unplayable.  Last year I was playing several games including Jedi Survivor, at 4k, everything maxed out, getting 110-140fps. I updated my driver's and I suddenly I could barely hit 40fps, and it felt more like 10fps.  I rolled back to the previous update and it was immediately fine again and back to normal.  Could it be software related?",Negative
Intel,"Checked BIOS CPU Temp, says 29-32 Celcius.  Did UserBenchmark, it said everything came across either slightly below, where it should be, or better than it should perform.

Intel,"Best bet is to indeed reseat everything. Try with only 1 ram stick, in a different slot, and if that doesn't work, swap the stick as well. Unplug everything you can miss, including usb drives.   If none of that helps, try to unplug the weird hard drive you got. Hope you got a backup solution.   Personal advice, completely unrelated to your question: be on the lookout for an 8 core x3D chip. It will postpone the date you will feel you need to upgrade by 5 years or so. But they've ran out of supply and are stupidly expensive now. Maybe at some point you might be able to get one for a decent price, and when that happens, I would jump on it.",Neutral
Intel,What are your CPU and GPU temps? Clock speeds? CPU and GPU utilization? monitor everything  The 9060 XT 8gb pairing may be detrimental if you ever hit the VRAM limit. Pcie 5.0 GPUs like the 9060 XT performance gets obliterated IF you hit the 8gb VRAM limit on pcie 3.0 and even pcie 4.0. 5500 is limited to pcie 3.0 and it has less cache than other AM4 CPUs. So just be mindful of that if you notice bad performance in harder to run games and higher graphic settings.,Negative

Intel,Take it to a professional no one here seems to know the problem,Negative
Intel,"My ssd has never hit 100, actually if anything its the cpu that will randomly spike",Negative
Intel,That was my first thought honestly,Neutral
Intel,"I scrolled way too far to see this, as I had the same thought. Slam it in gen3 and retest. Multiple pcie gens can make stability tricky for sure.",Negative

Intel,"Its only at 30 Celcius, not burning hot",Neutral
Intel,30 Degrees Celcius in the bios screen,Neutral
Intel,Bro I think you should physically remove the CPU and install it again if nothing changes you said it's not your first timing building so I am assuming that you could have another CPU so try that out and see what happens,Neutral
Intel,There's no integrated graphics on that CPU so it literally wouldn't output anything if that were the case,Negative
Intel,"Its into the gpu haha, not my first pc build lol, which is why this is so confusing",Negative
Intel,Try reseating your CPU,Neutral
Intel,Is your SSD gen 4 or gen 3 ? Cuz if it's gen 4 the 5 5500 doesn't support the gen 4 which might be causing the issue here,Neutral

Intel,"yes, i did take the sticker off lol",Neutral
Intel,"Second this, had the same issue on an itx build with a gen 3 riser and a gen 4 gpu, capping the bios to gen 3 fixed all the instability",Neutral
Intel,Did you use DDU each time to remove the old drivers before installing the new drivers. Could be all of the drivers conflicting with each other.,Neutral
Intel,I'm thinking storage instability i.e. bad ssd  Ram instability  Or a bad os install- but not really sold on that theory,Negative
Intel,"Havent looked it up, your right. Maybe he didnt installed fhe drivers?",Neutral
Intel,You need to monitor everything when you’re having your issues   BIOS is just idle temps,Neutral
Intel,"See i was a little worried about it too, but ive seen many other builds run it just fine. Also, i am only really feeling the effects of cpu issues. But im not sure what about the cpu is the problem",Neutral
Intel,download HWinfo64 and check your temps. and give us a picture of your build.,Neutral
Intel,"I see what youre saying, but my benchmarks for those both come out good.   Like the issues on my benchmarks are in gpu and cpu. But I cant understand why",Negative
Intel,"I did a benchmark and everything got a good rating, and while doing ""demanding"" tasks, like this stupid excel thing, my cpu will randomly spike to 100 and then go back to normal. but the others stay fine",Positive
Intel,Honestly after giving it a think it's likely that your CPU is in I/O wait on the cheap ssd. It will report as high utilization when it's just waiting on an I/O operation. I would test read and write speed on that thing and possibly A/B test it if you have literally any other storage laying around.,Neutral
Intel,"Even if the drive is supposed to perform decently, it’s way more likely for an SSD to be faulty than a CPU.",Negative
Intel,Did you remove the plastic from the cooler before installing it?,Neutral
Intel,"Right, bjt yours might not be fine. If it is a budget item, it will have a higher failure or fault rate.",Negative
Intel,"Im not sure how to add a photo, I am not super familiar with reddit. Also in bios my temp was 32 celcius for cpu",Negative
Intel,What benchmark?  Spike to 100 utilization or Celsius?,Neutral
Intel,Try reseating your CPU and re install the necessary drivers from AMD Adrenalin.,Neutral
Intel,"yea im just not familiar with linux, or anything of the sorts. I have seen some people say its a bios update issue between cpu and mb but ive tried updating the drivers",Negative
Intel,"not sure why you got so downvoted for this comment. but HWinfo doesnt just tell you cpu temps - it also tells you tells you the temps of all your components (RAM, motherboard, GPU, etc) also if there are windows errors or drive errors. its just a really good visual tool for troubleshooting.",Neutral
Intel,Yeah 32 in the CPU is slightly off it should be around 45-50 without gaming the CPU is not taking full power from the motherboard I recommend taking it off a and putting it on again if possible and download all the chipset drivers again ( delete the old ones ) and try benchmarking so you can see what is causing issues,Negative
Intel,You wouldn’t be doing anything “linuxy”. There’s nothing to familiarize yourself with. Just open 50 browser tabs and see if it gets bogged down.,Neutral
Intel,Idk people just be hating for nothing I have my pc CPU get 45C° without anything so I assumed that 32 is a bit low not SO LOW like I am suggesting a solution to try rather than copy pasting every comment here,Negative
Intel,being colder than average is not a reason to repaste your cpu. AiOs typically keep cpus in that range at idle.,Neutral
Intel,"just did that, memory went up to 30 ish percent, never spiking, cpu went to 30 %, and ssd didnt move from 0",Neutral
Intel,I’m confused.,Negative
Intel,"Damn that's lopsided. The 10900K is less troublesome than the 16gb of memory, honestly.   Like, 16 is fine, right up until it isn't and then everything falls over no matter how much other hardware you've thrown at the problem. If you'd bought 32gb of DDR4, I'd be on Team GPU, but you didn't. So I'd go for the platform.",Negative
Intel,"Your 10900k does just fine for the 1440p resolution. However, the 3080 10gb is getting a little old in the current crop of games. The largest fps increase and longevity come from upgrading the graphics card.    Now: Go with 9070 XT. Only go with 9850 X3D if your CPU is bottlenecking you or if you want ultra high refresh competitive FPS.",Neutral
Intel,"Both of those upgrade paths are reasonable, and it'll come down to the specific game as to which is better. My gut says that CPU + mobo + RAM upgrade is better overall.",Positive
Intel,"Check your GPU utilization while playing games.  If it's maxing out, you'll see more gains upgrading it first.  If not, upgrade CPU.",Neutral
Intel,take the cpu mobo ram combo deal and do as big as gpu upgrade as possible,Neutral
Intel,Thank you everybody.,Positive
Intel,"I haven’t touched my rig since 22… so it’s been the same since, which is so unusual for me but kids came along and a wife lol.. my friend has the same graphics card as me, but he upgraded his processor to the 9800X 3-D and he’s averaging 20 to 40 and higher FPS in every game",Positive
Intel,"[16GB is fine the majority of cases if you're only gaming.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj5v52R4qnk) Although it's definitely starting to show its age, I wouldn't call it a limitation for gaming just yet.  OP could probably just get another set of 2x8 DDR4 though. Most ATX LGA1200 boards have four slots afaik.",Neutral
Intel,"I think thats a bad take. $500 bucks for new ram versus a new cpu or money towards a new gpu will absolutely do far more for system performance than new ram. At the moment 16gb is still fine. 16gb isnt causing anything worth playing today to fall over. Some titles ms flight sim or if you heavily mod games will perform marginally better. Far from falling over.  Building new? Yeah, dont get 16gb. You could hit limitations in the next few years.  https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/memory/my-testing-shows-that-16-gb-of-system-memory-is-still-absolutely-fine-for-todays-pc-games-but-there-are-some-caveats-to-it-all/",Negative
Intel,I want 140 fps on high settings that’s it lol,Neutral
Intel,I guess I should say I’m more concerned with getting a steady 140+ FPS on most of my games instead of ultra high FPS on a few competitive shooter games,Neutral
Intel,"What if I said, I could get a free 7800XT gpu which is technically better than my 3080.",Positive
Intel,"Can’t do cpu upgrade and gpu, it’s either or",Negative
Intel,"Yeah that kind of sounds about right for the sorts of games you're playing; it's all stuff that isn't *really* all that graphics-intensive so I can see the 3080 being plenty to leave the 10900K relatively gasping for air. If you're already running max settings, and turning them down doesn't improve your FPS, it's clearly time for CPU/platform upgrades.  On the other hand, if turning your graphics down swings your frame rate up, a GPU change will be of more benefit.",Neutral
Intel,Maybe try to find soke cheapish 16 gigs of 3600 in the used marketplace?  Once in a while i see people sell for an okay price tbh.. and then upgrade gpu  Moving to am5 and 32 gigs of ddr5 is really not worth it…,Neutral
Intel,"$500 for a 32gb kit of DDR4 would be dumb, absolutely. Because you can get a whole combo including 32 of DDR5 for like $800.   That's why I said initially that *going for the new platform* probably makes sense as opposed to trying to throw more RAM into the 10900K setup.",Negative
Intel,Then I'd take the 7800XT and definitely go for a platform upgrade,Neutral
Intel,"if you took the combo deal, how long would it take for you to get a new gpu, or sell the 3080 to put money towards a newer one?",Neutral
Intel,"I have religiously turned off shadows for years to gain fps, I do indeed turn graphics down to get more fps. I’m just wondering if I can’t upgrade again for years, will my 10900k still be okay with a 9070 xt? It’s hard to say when I’ll have another chance to upgrade. I hate being so behind the times, I liked the idea of upgrading my processor because it completely renewed my whole system and gets me on board with what’s current..  I was hoping that that would gain me the most FPS, but I’m starting to think getting another 16 gigs of RAM and a new graphics card might be best",Neutral
Intel,Thinking really going to 32 would make a difference,Neutral
Intel,Could be a year from now or 2.. my life has changed quite a bit so this stuff is on the back burner a ton sadly. My little brother offered me his 7800xt however.,Negative
Intel,"I could technically sell my 10900k, Mobo, ram and 3080 and get a 9070 xt maybe.",Neutral
Intel,"So, shadows are weird because they can unload both the CPU and the GPU. Really the one to play with is resolution; if dropping it (or throwing more upscaler at it) gets you to the framerate you're after, then your CPU isn't really a problem.   From most benchmarks I can find, the 10900K is still able to hang in there in most games at well over 100fps but may struggle in newer stuff trying to do 180+. But basically, if you still want more frames than you can get by slamming everything to competitive settings, it's platform time. If you just want more eye candy at roughly the same performance level as those reduced settings, go GPU.",Neutral
Intel,"IF possible, get the ram cpu mobo deal, and sell the 3080 and 7800xt, then get a better gpu.  Although thats obviously easier said than done and its understandable if you dont want to do that, either gpu will work fine for a year or 2 in the new build, but as others have pointed out, you could also just get the 9070xt first, then wait a year or 2 THEN upgrade the rest of the system.",Neutral
Intel,"Man, I greatly appreciate these responses. It’s helping me out… so I have been a competitive counterstrike player since 2003 so religiously even in battlefield I constantly turn Settings all the way down to get the most FPS.. but now is I’m casual I would love to be able to crank the graphic settings in battlefield and still achieve over 140 FPS or so.. so I have to say my goal is to be able to run at least high settings on my current resolution and gain enough FPS",Positive
Intel,"I’m on board with only doing a 9070 xt for now as for one it’s easier, more simple. I just want to know which path will give me the most gains now and will be more future proof for the time being.",Positive
Intel,"BF to my knowledge has some settings that are CPU heavy and others that are all GPU hit, but I'd try like 720P Ultra Maximum Overkill + (upscaler) Ultra Performance and see where you land with your current setup in terms of framerate. If it's good enough, then a GPU upgrade along with some more RAM will let you bring the resolution back up. If it isn't, time for a platform.",Neutral
Intel,"then yeah, do that as it will suffice, it will cause a small bottleneck but thatll go both ways",Neutral
Intel,Thanks! I’ll definitely try that. My brother could Give me his 7800xt which is better than my 3080 then I could do a platform upgrade,Positive
Intel,"Not sure 7800xt is an upgrade in experience. It is on specs, but that's about it.  9800x3d + 3080 will be an absolute beast.  If you want to improve bf6, start with ram. Another 16gb then look at an avx overclock.   My second machine is a 9900k over clocked slightly, 2080ti slightly oc, 64gb cl16 3600mhz and AVG fps on bf6 @ 1440 is 100+.  Tarkov is the only game that killed that machine, it's a piece of shit that loves L3 cache. Otherwise I would still be gaming on it.   Some slight tweaks to yours might save you a lot of hassle.",Neutral
Intel,"The 7800 XT is not better than the 3080; they're basically equal. The 3080 has DLSS though, so unless you like tinkering and don't mind using Optiscaler, then the 3080 is overall better. The only downside is its 10GB of VRAM. I had a 7800XT just a couple months ago, and FSR 4 worked great through Optiscaler. Basically any game with DLSS or FSR support (any version), you can get FSR 4 to work. It's like four steps and you're good to go. It's the INT 8 version (unofficial), but the image quality is close to the same as the official FP8 FSR 4.  If you want to keep your RAM (which I don't think is too little for just gaming right now, and you can always get another 2x8 kit), then your best bet for a CPU upgrade would be something like a 14600K or 14700K. I would stay away from the 14900K just because of the degradation issues they've had, which seems to be extra bad for the 14900K  Although, your 10900K is only about 20-30% slower than a 14600K at 1080p from what I can gather, which isn't really that limiting at 1440p. If you don't mind switching platform altogether, I'd get a 7800X3D and 32GB of DDR5. Personally, I don't think the 8% uplift for a 9800X3D is worth the ~$40-50 premium.  If I were you I'd probably get a 9070 XT or 5070 Ti and a 2x8 kit of DDR4 and call it a day. Maybe a new mobo and a 14600K as well if you feel like the CPU is hampering you. You should be able to find an LGA1700 motherboard and a 14600KF for ~$350, which is a little under the price for just a 7800X3D by itself. KF btw means it's a 14600K without integrated graphics. It's over $50 cheaper than the 14600K, but the exact same performance. Only downside is you can't troubleshoot if your GPU dies. You'd need another discrete GPU to get an image.",Neutral
Intel,So keep the GPU and upgrade the rest?! Sounds good to me… that was my initial thought really so that I’m brought to a new platform and up to date in that regards.,Positive
Intel,Gosh! So rough one person says cpu upgrade then other says GPU haha.,Negative
Intel,9060xt,Neutral
Intel,Is the 16gb not an option,Neutral
Intel,"If the cards you've listed are your only options, RX 9060 XT. The other options have their gaming performances kneecapped by your current CPU being too slow and stuck with PCIe 3.0 instead of newer PCIe standards.",Neutral
Intel,9060XT 16GB ? Would stay away from 8GB cards when buying new. If this is not an option and i'd have to choose from the 3 stated i'd go with B580 solely going by the 12GB VRAM,Neutral
Intel,"Unless it's very cheap, I wouldn't bother with the 5060 and an i5 10400. In most games, the CPU bottleneck will be hit. The RX 9060 XT is the best all-around option; it has a strong rasterizer, no driver nonsense, and is good in 1080p and 1440p resolutions. If you're only playing modern games and it's considerably cheaper, the Arc B580 is tolerable. For all three, a 650W power supply is enough.",Neutral
Intel,"An RX 7600 XT would be a good option. So would a 9060 XT. Also, you're good bro. I'm still running an i7-10700 with the TDP set to 125W and it still handles literally anything I could throw at it. I have literally zero reason to upgrade. People in this sub are borderline obsessed with blowing all their money on new hardware every two years. They probably drag their feet when they walk and breath through their mouths. Don't let it get to you.",Positive
Intel,I was going to say 9060 xt but since you said for minecraft then I would say 100% 5060 bc minecraft is super nvidia favoured.   However for general gaming 9060 xt 8gb,Neutral

Intel,Ant particular games/applications you care about?,Neutral
Intel,9060xt,Neutral
Intel,"If you really can't squeeze a 9060 xt 16 GB in then the B580. Or maybe a used good condition 3060 12 GB, very similar performance, but gets NVidia drivers.   Modded MC, Cyberpunk, and especially modded Skyrim really thrive off Vram.",Neutral
Intel,"Living in 2026 with a 2020 CPU… respect the patience 😂    For 1080p high / 1440p medium in Minecraft with shaders + Cyberpunk, \*\*RX 9060 XT\*\* hits the sweet spot between FPS and VRAM.    RTX 5060 will be bottlenecked by your CPU, and Arc B580 is okay if you want 12GB VRAM and some Intel vibes.    What FPS do you guys get in Cyberpunk on a mid-range GPU + i5-10400?",Neutral
Intel,The Arc is the slowest but will not have VRAM limitations.  The RX 9060XT should be the fastest.  NVidia has technology in the works to reduce the VRAM requirements of games but no official word on its progress has ever been made.,Neutral
Intel,"I'd recommend 9060xt 8gb. Intel Arc cards still have driver overhead issues on older CPUs, despite being improved somewhat. Nvidia is using PCIE 5.0 x8 on their 50 and 60 class cards which will be a problem on your PCIE 3.0 system with ""only"" 8gb VRAM, and a 5060 might be overkill for your CPU anyway. 9060xt on the other hand still uses x16 interface, which means better compatibility with PCIE 3.0, and 8gb VRAM is fine for 1080p",Neutral
Intel,RTX 2070 Super. Not waste anything.,Positive
Intel,Talk about living in the past. We are in 2026.,Negative
Intel,I would pick 5060 from these and get DLSS and other features. I would suggest a used 3080 but your psu wouldn't handle it. 4060ti 16gb would be grand if you find it used at a good price,Neutral
Intel,"Can confirm. I paired a 9060xt 16gb with my i7-8700 and it works great for me. The 8700 is probably fairly close in performance to the 10400.  As for the vram usage, I only play Marvel Rivals 1080P and I have never seen the Vram go above 6-7GB on Ultra settings. Can't say what it would be like on other games.  I would not hesitate to get those other cards depending on the local prices. I was lucky enough to get mine for $390 with a 5% discount a month ago, but it looks like the prices are up since then.",Positive

Intel,Can agree to disagree about that for obvious reasons but the 9900 is going to suck balls if it does run out of ram on pcie3,Negative
Intel,"Yeah but Nvidia uses the x8 interface, so with PCIe 3.0 you're still getting only 3.0 x8, which is equivalent to 4.0 x4 or 5.0 x2. Absolute dick move from them to cheap out on the lanes.",Negative
Intel,"For the Arc B580, PCIe 3.0 isn't a big issue as long as the CPUs that are stuck with it are at least as fast as the Core i5-12400F and/or the Ryzen 5 5600. Anything slower and CPU overhead issues will come up along with PCIe bandwidth issues (Arc B580 is stuck with 8 PCIe lanes only).  For the RTX 5060, being stuck with 8 PCIe lanes only and requiring a PCIe 5.0 slot for maximum performance cripples its gaming performance when paired with a CPU that's stuck with PCIe 3.0 support.  About my suggestion, I've shown some mercy since it has access to 16 PCIe lanes.",Neutral

Intel,Oh right completely forgot about bullshit they pulled on 5060 cards. In that case only TI 16GB version is worth considering,Negative

Intel,"Is the framerate you're limited at actually bad?     There aren't worthwhile budget AM5 upgrades due to RAM, personally I'd get a 1440P OLED monitor instead, that'll work the GPU harder",Negative
Intel,Doesn't an AM5 build require the latest gen ram? The one that's super expensive lately?,Negative
Intel,Go 1440p and forget about your problems. 1080 is the issue here. I have a 5600 and 3080 and it still rips.,Negative
Intel,dude.... stay Am4 and upgrade that.,Neutral
Intel,I have a 9070xt with 5600x. Playing at 1440p. Yea sure sometimes the cpu is a bottleneck but i dont have any issues with the setup whatsoever.,Neutral
Intel,"I would stay simple with your current board and RAM and find a CPU that can push frames to the GPU more efficiently. I'd be scrounging around for a 5800x3d somewhere. If you can find a CPU with a few more cores and the x3d v-cache it'll push that card harder at a fraction of the price of upgrading mobo, ram, AND CPU all at once in this market.",Neutral
Intel,I run games at 1440p with a 5600X and 6750XT. Short of an unobtanium AM4 X3D chip there is no real cheap way to get onto AM5.,Neutral

Intel,higher resolution monitor and if you still feel like the pi is bottlenecked get an am4 ryzen 7. i run 9060xt 16gb with an r7 5800x in 1440p and it holds up very well. saves you the cost of RAM and mobo as you can keep all of that,Positive
Intel,"""cheap"" during this ai slop year doesnt exist unfortunately",Negative
Intel,"i read some of the comments and yes, upgrading to AM5 would be awesome but realistically you would want 32gb DDR5, which is about 300e used, a b850 mobo which you said, 100-150e used and a 7800x3d, 300e used. so it would be like 750 euro to upgrade. i understand your hesitation to upgrade to an x3d chip on AM4 since those prices are ridiculous now. i think you cna upgrade to a 5700x or ideally 5800x (non 3D) for under 200 euro and sell your 5600. That would give you a solid boost in your CPU and lets you save up money to upgrade to AM5 in a few years",Neutral

Intel,"b650e >= b850 btw.  B850 just guarantees pcie gen 5 SSD, b650E guarantees PCIE Gen 5 x16 slot. Ofc some b850 boards do have pcie gen 5 x16 as well, but you gotta double check.  Anyways, what's your total budget?",Neutral
Intel,"I'm in the new monitor train as some other commenters. 1440p will move some strain from the cpu to the gpu because that's basically what you want. 5600 is still a beast but If you absolutely want to upgrade that, get the new 5800XT. If you can fit both into your budget, why not do both? Anyways, happy hunting",Positive
Intel,"Are you using antilag 2 in arc raiders? I've found that the latency reduction stuff made games at sub 100 feel FAR nicer than they did before.  I don't think an upgrade is worth it at all right now given the ram prices. Your only bet would be a miracle 5700x3d or 5800x3d used for a good price, and that's highly unlikely.",Negative
Intel,"I ended up buying a 75€ ITX motherboard from AliExpress. CPU 7500F - 7700X are all great. Good luck with RAM - if you're crafty you can try your luck with SODIMM memory and adapters.  I've noticed this with the 7800XT. It feels like there's a driver / cpu overhead issue. My friend with a 5600X and 7800XT had similar stutters and unexpected performance dips with the combination and I've seen and replied to a thread saying the same thing a year ago.  A 5800X with 8 cores might solve the issue, I haven't had the chance to test.",Positive
Intel,7800X3D 🙂👍,Positive
Intel,What country are you buying in?,Neutral
Intel,"This sub is notoriously known for anti AM5 upgrade recommendations (because RAM is soooooo expensive 🙄), even if you tell them, hey, I got this bundle (Mobo /CPU / ram) from microcenter for $599, does not really apply to you since you are in Europe, they would still recommend sticking to AM4 and try to push 5800x3d narrative even though it does not make any sense to buy that cpu for $400 on second hand market.   Can you afford 7800x3d? If yes, go for it. Any b850 motherboard would do it as well.",Negative
Intel,"Have you considered going to a Ryzen 7 5800X/XT first before you are contemplating going on AM5?   Asking because I’m on two 1080p monitors with a 5060 Ti 16 GB and a 3060 12 GB (dual GPU setup) and I have full GPU usage. Would have to try it with arc raiders but you might just have the bottleneck because of the 5600 being definitely weaker than the 5800X.   Could be the best budget solution for you, over getting overpriced AM5.",Neutral
Intel,What ram do you currently have with 5600?,Neutral
Intel,"you literally said vsr at 1440p didn't change much AND bumping settings to epic barely dropped fps. that tells you the cpu/ram is the hard ceiling here not the resolution. everyone saying (just get 1440p) isn't gonna fix your problem it'll just make the gpu work harder while you're still capped at the same frames.  before you spend anything, check if your ram is actually running at 3200 or if it's sitting at jedec 2133. cl22 at 3200 smells like jedec defaults. open cpu-z and check. if it's 2133 you found your problem for free.",Negative

Intel,Ddr5 ram and cheap in the same sentence.            Who would have thought?,Negative
Intel,"13600k with ddr4 mobo and reuse your ram, obvious choice",Neutral
Intel,"I had the exact same issue as you and it frustrated me for the longest time. I upgraded to a 5070 from a 2070 super, CPU was Ryzen 5800x. Tried to play Arc raiders and I had the same frames if not worse on 1080p with a 5070 compared to my 2070 super.  Ended up spending the extra money and upgrading to AM5 and it was absolutely worth it. Went from 100 - 120fps fps on 1080/1440p (was the exact same for me) to about 220-240fps on 1440p. Found a cheap bundle deal on Facebook marketplace for a 7800x3d and 32GB of DDR5 CL30 6000 RAM for about £400 (Found this last month so yeah after DDR5 price increase). Bought a B650 Eagle for 120 off Amazon, so worked up to £520 total  Sold my old parts for 200 (CPU, Mobo and DDR4 RAM), so all in all spent about £320, which was worth it for me.  Think about it like this, RAM prices may not get better for a while, yeah you could go and try to get a 5800x3d (good luck they dont produce those no more) but for a little extra money you could get waaaaay more performance upgrading to AM5. Keep looking around Facebook for some good deals, took me a while to find one but you will find something eventually.  Sounds like to me Arc Raiders is your main game, in which case I would highly recommend upgrading. If not you could stay on your current platform, and a 1440p monitor would be the sensible upgrade. OLEDs are expensive and yeah theyre cool (I have the MO27Q28G) but most are above 240hz refresh rate, which ideally you would like to hit to make the most of the money youre gonna spend on one.  FYI - I tried all the overclocking and Precision boost overdrive BS and everything else in between there was to try and squeeze more performance out of the CPU to limit the bottleneck, nothing worked.  Edit: I also used the 2x frame gen to get more GPU utilization, gives a nice FPS boost and the latency increase was not that bad, but it still bothered me enough to want to upgrade.",Neutral
Intel,"Don’t upgrade to am5, even then at 1080p you wouldn’t get full use off your GPU in some games. It’ll be a lot better to get a 1440p monitor and that will eliminate your bottleneck. For cheap option you can get an IPS 1440p monitor for less than $200. For $400-500 which is what you spent on AM5 upgrade you can get an extremely nice OLED 1440p monitor.",Neutral
Intel,"A microcenter combo deal is your best bet. If you can’t get that, you might be out of luck in terms of “cheap” solutions",Neutral
Intel,"Ur current system is capable to 1440p so I advice u to upgrade ur monitor to 1440p 27” , 32” or go with ultra-wide one that will gives a u a better experience unless u r playing esports games in this case search in ur market place for used or new Ryzen 7 5700x3D or Ryzen 7 5800x3D for reasonable price",Neutral

Intel,just upgrade your cpu tbh thats a better choice get ryzen 7 5700x or ryzen 7 5700x3d since its not a good idea to upgrade to am5 after the ram prices increased but its up  to your man its still your decision follow what your heart desires,Neutral
Intel,"I think you should just get a Ryzen 7 5700X or 5800X, whichever is cheaper, and your performance will be much better. (if you can get your hands on a 5700X3D you'll see no bottleneck anymore)  How much RAM do you currently have?  If you have the budget and want to get to AM5, you can go for parts like:  MSI B850 Tomahawk  Ryzen 5 7500x3d (if the budget permits 7800x3d)  32 gigabytes of RAM  Unfortunately, you are looking at either spending around $200-300 to just get a CPU upgrade on AM4 or spending $700-$800 to hop on the new platform...  I'd suggest getting a CPU upgrade only. What do you think?

Intel,It's definitely the monitor. I had that same setup on my 1440p monitor back then and I was only bottlenecked in eSports games.   Triple A games were fine tho 1% lows did suffer. Try using VSR and run the game at 1440p to get a feel on how the game performs.,Neutral
Intel,"I see, would be worth testing. You could even buy a monitor on amazon, test it, then return it withing the return window for a full refund.

Intel,"Hmm, yeah that's a good point. 5800XT is not the largest upgrade from a 5600 but i really can't recommend going AM5 in the current market with a clean conscience.",Negative
Intel,"Oh, yeah go immediately turn that on in the settings, it'll drastically lower your input latency and will probably make the game feel a lot nicer for you.  High refresh rates mainly feel nice because of the lower input lag, and the visual smoothness/clarity in motion? 90fps is definitely a lot better than 60, and with antilag 2 your latency should be FAR better than what you're currently getting.  Give it a go and let me know though, maybe you'll still want to upgrade. But if you do like it, I'd recommend looking into optiscaler because it can inject antilag 2 into games that don't normally have it (if they're single player or non-anticheat games).",Positive
Intel,"https://de.pcpartpicker.com/list/zjLQpK  That's what I would do. I looked at the prices for 2x8 kits and they are quite bad, you can also go 1x16 (and add another stick later) but you will lose a lot of performance from not using 2 sticks.  You can go a bit cheaper with the CPU if needed, 7600(X) or 9600(X), the 7600X3D is just a good step up for quite a few games.  You can go also look at a slightly more expensive motherboard, only downside to that one is that it only supports PCIe gen4, while others can do gen5. For your GPU it doesn't make any difference, but for a future GPU it could make a (small) performance difference.",Negative
Intel,7600x3d would do it too. Anything would be a big upgrade vs your current CPU.,Positive
Intel,Also its still 300€,Neutral
Intel,I was thinking if maybe ram speeds are the problem because 5600 is very sensitive to that. I would honestly wait until this ram mess is over. Paying that overpriced prices for ram is crazy. What settings do you use in Arc Raiders?,Negative
Intel,"1599.7 is correct because that's 3200 MT/s so your ram is running where it should. This leaves us with cpu bound because of the fact that high drops fps 15% while low/medium barely changes anything. At low settings the gpu finishes frames instantly and waits on the cpu. at high the gpu finally has enough work to become the limiter. so yeah I think your cpu is genuinely the bottleneck, 1440p monitor alone won't save you.  Just grab a 5800x and a decent 3600 cl16 kit, won't cost you more than a monitor upgrade and actually addresses the problem. am5 can wait until ddr5 stops being robbery.",Neutral
Intel,Depends on price I suppose. Should run the GPU better. Probably better off getting an X3D chip and calling it good,Neutral
Intel,"Dude your post brought back the trauma of spending hours tweaking curve optimizer, 3dmark and cinebench, all in the name of reducing the bottleneck. Nothing works like a upgrade, you could get the last 7 series chip (5900x) and you will still have the same issue.  Yeah go for it. I'd suggest getting 32gb of DDR5, best bet is second hand with these prices. 16GB is risky if you plan to upgrade later to 32 as they need to both be compatible, but single channel can work in a pinch theres a bunch of Youtube vids comparing the difference.",Negative

Intel,"Well, if you have the budget, the parts you mentioned sound like a good upgrade path that will work perfectly with your new GPU :)  Plus, once you sell what you currently own, you'll offset some of the costs, so it'll actually be a 300 euro upgrade.

Intel,So it has to be what 6000+ and anything below CL36?,Neutral
Intel,"Not true.  OP would see decent benefit from even a 7600.  Most people don't know about EXPO profiles and don't use them, and they are off by default.  As long as it isn't 4800 CL56 or something, OP will be fine.  And AMD is pretty stable on DDR5, now.  5600 CL40 is the fastest JEDEC 5600 bin and should provide good performance.  Will you get better performance with 6000 CL30?  Absolutely.  5-10fps worth of performance?  Not even close.  A R5 7600 is still about a 15% CPU improvement over the R5 5600.  A R5 9600X is near 30% improvement.  Is it worth the cost of CPU, motherboard AND memory, though?  I don't know.  But if you are getting decent game play, I wouldn't worry about it.  EDIT:  For clarification, when I say ""Not even close"", I mean that going from slower RAM to faster RAM will NOT give you a 5-10fps uplift.  It might be 1fps at best and only noticeable in benchmark scores.  You are NOT going to ""kneecap"" a 7600 with slower memory.  Running a single stick of memory would be far worse than running 2 sticks of slower memory.",Neutral

Intel,"Well how much RAM do you have, what’s the Speed and CAS Latency?  If it’s really low end ram such as 2133 MHz then that’s understandable… But not if it’s 3200 MHz.  I run 2x 16 Corsair Vengeance LPX CL18 3600 MHz in my rig and it works just fine.  Bro it’s 300 € for a single CPU vs atrocious prices for DDR5 RAM.

Intel,What are the main features to look for when shopping OLED 1440p monitors? I'm on a 9070XT & 5700X3D and want to upgrade to OLED. I need ultrawide as well.   Just uncertain on brand quality + reasonable pricing to look out for.,Neutral
Intel,Or a 1440P display in general   Could always get a miniLED,Neutral
Intel,"I agree with him, replace it with a 1440p Monitor and that CPU will do you just fine for a couple more years. Just dont get a cheap VA panel. But OLED is amazing.",Positive
Intel,"IPS is, imo, the next best panel before OLED. Decent color reproduction, fast response times and they're getting cheaper as more and more OLED panels are coming out. I do agree that a jump in resolution would be a worthy investment to balance out your PC. If you absolutely wanted to upgrade the CPU though a 5800x3d would be a worthy upgrade with changing your entire system.",Positive
Intel,"If you want a worthwhile upgrade over the 5600, yeah   Personally, I think your money is better spent on a 1440P OLED monitor   Stress the GPU more, better image quality and motion tracking, same framerate",Positive
Intel,"The uplift from the 5600 to the 7600 is ~20%, with 6000 MHz CL30   Any reduction to that borders on untoicable without a framerate counter",Neutral
Intel,Forget the x3D chips.  Just get like a 5800XT.,Neutral
Intel,i have the 5900x,Neutral
Intel,"There are plenty of YouTube reviews that can show you specific CPU vs specific CPU. The 7500x3d would beat the 7600x in gaming, but not productivity. Again, you're still not taking into account the massive RAM cost that will inevitably be your biggest expense right now. Cutting your CPU budget further to pay for your RAM is only going to hamper your computer's ability to play future games at respectable fps. I tend never to go budget options, because you always get what you pay for. It's just a matter of diminishing returns at higher prices. I'm telling you, finding a good 5 series x3d processor will be the better option at this point. A year ago, not so, but now, it absolutely is.",Neutral
Intel,Maybe u can try running it in exclusive full screen? Otherwise you'd have to set ur windows setting resolution to 4K,Neutral
Intel,"the stock amd cooler may have to work quite hard and loud to cool 9600x even though it is an efficient cpu, although if you dont want the new air cooler the stock cooler should suffice short term.   and yeah for ram just get 16gb for now",Neutral
Intel,"arc raiders seems like a very demanding game, you should adjust settings down and to put more strain on gpu you should get an actual higher res monitor so the gpu has to work harder to drive it",Negative
Intel,"okay, so if you are not really considering selling it around 200 euro, that means you pretty much just put it to the side to gather dust? if that's the case i would recommend even more to upgrade to 57-5800x",Neutral
Intel,"If it is in your budget, then yes.

It's just slowly becoming more trendy, so just in case I added it in. It's a niche, lsfg and afmf can use a 2nd gpu to generate frames.",Neutral
Intel,"Then you might not be too sensitive to latency, which is a good thing for PC building as it means you probably don't need to really bother with a super high end CPU. Also means that things like frame gen are very much on the table for you, if that's available in arc raiders.",Positive
Intel,"Note on the Gigabyte board, if you mean the Gaming WIFI 6 then you should consider if wifi speed is at all important to you. WIFI 6E is quite a bit faster than regular 6, so if wifi was important I would consider the Gigabyte EAGLE WIFI6E.  Also to add that if you are looking for used RAM, if you do with an X3D processor the RAM speed becomes a lot less important, so if you see a good deal on some lower speed / higher CL RAM it can still be good if you end with the X3D CPU. The X3D part of an AMD CPU solves the same performance problem (but better) that fast RAM solves.",Neutral
Intel,"2x8 CL22 3200Mhz, No XPM tho.",Neutral
Intel,Whaat? I had rx7600 few days ago and I played on medium with native fsr aa with 75-100 fps. Something is clearly wrong with your system. What fps do you get on low?,Negative
Intel,Well if you’re spending that amount anyway then of course am5 makes more sense for longevity.  Just don’t cheap out on the ram when you do it. get at least a 7600x3d so slower ram doesn’t kill your performance and you can grab whatever ddr5 deal you find without stressing about speed or timings​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​.,Neutral
Intel,does OLED use more gpu than IPS? I wasn't aware,Neutral
Intel,"The features depend on what you want, 4k or 1440p? 240 or 165hz or higher? Dual mode (it can switch between 2 different resolutions on the fly, each with their own refresh rate). Yes, OLED has some quirks, burn in being one of them, the panels themselves can be more finicky with grey banding, flicker from VRR, but as with anything else you buy getting a dud is unavoidable. Might I suggest looking at the aw3425dw, it's a qdoled (quantum dot OLED)? I'm currently using one and it's been great so far. It has a 3yr burn in warranty from Dell, comes color calibrated from Dell and if you get it from best buy you can get their warranty as well, which imo is worth it as they've been very good at either replacing the item or giving you the amount you bought it for in store credit to go towards a similar item. Every panel is going to have its issues but if you want to chat about it, send me a message and I'll gladly go through some things with you.",Neutral
Intel,"Price. Features. Connectivity.  So from top of my head, the 2026 monitors have: •stripe pixels for better text •true black 500 vs 400 •more scratch resistant screen •better oled care features •darker screen and less purple glow   Then decide how much curve you want for immersion and if you want optional stuff like KVM or more HDMI/dp ports.  At the moment, I don't trust Samsung QC or warranty and have read a few bad things about MSI too. But this also probably comes down to your own country.",Neutral
Intel,"I'm sadly not too versed in the subject, from what I've seen OLED has some issues, the biggest being burn in.  mini led seems like a great alternative and can be significantly cheaper so I'm looking into that. some good monitors (ktc, AOC) can be had for 200€ where I am, ultrawide options are sadly limited and the cheap ones I've seen aren't that great.",Negative

Intel,"4K interests me, but I don't know if I need it just yet and would be more keen on waiting another 5+ years to see what is out there for 4K ultrawide as options seem slim right now.   I'm good with 165+ as my main game is Monster Hunter Wilds and I wouldn't be reaching much past this anyway on ultra settings in 1440P.  Ironically, I have an ultrawide Alienware (AW3420DW - IPS panel at 120hz) that I got back in 2020. It's been great, so I'm 100% into the idea of leaning on Alienware for my upgrade. I've seen the AW3423DW & DWF topping charts in the past few years and just recently learned about the 2025 version which you're referencing! I don't think I have a preference on QD-OLED vs WOLED, so I'm good with the QD.  The 2023 version seems to have the DW & DWF, and the only difference I can tell between the two (besides \~$150) is that the DW has a 240hz refresh rate and .03ms response rate, whereas the DWF has a 165hz and .1ms response rate.   These are both negligible to me, so I'd prefer the cheaper version. But I'm *only* seeing the DW for the 2025 version and no DWF alternative.  I'm curious if I can find a 25DW for any cheaper than $750. That's actually the price I bought my current monitor at back in 2020 (and on a 20% discount, believe it not). So I'm into the idea -- just curious if it goes for cheaper or there are any other Alienware OLED ultrawides on the horizon.  Thanks for your response!",Neutral

Intel,"There will always be some bottleneck in a system.  All a bottleneck means is that some component is what is limiting your performance.  It's literally impossible not to have one.  It's either gonna be your CPU or your GPU for a gaming PC.  That said, the 5800XT is much stronger than the 5600.  Will he get 100% utilization of his GPU at 1080p?  Probably not, but it'll likely be around 90%.  With the current market prices, it makes no sense to go AM5 right now when you could just slap in a stronger CPU on an AM4 system.",Negative

Intel,"No problem. I don't think you'll be able to find a good 34"" UW OLED for under $750 right now, so if you're comfortable waiting for prices to drop once the newer panels come out, I'd do that. Personally, after having gamed on this monitor for a few days, I'm absolutely in love with it. Or, if you're by a best buy see what open box options they have, I've had good luck with open box monitors from them and it helps being able to pick up their warranty for it as well.  Edit: I was in the same boat on 4k, glad I stuck with 1440 though as I'm still able to get really good frames with this 5070ti and the settings cranked. Playing some of these games at 200fps is nice lol.",Positive

Intel,"You’d rather have the GPU bottlenecking, which is the ideal bottleneck. No there is no guarantee a 5800XT will net 90% util. That’s an estimate and best case scenario.

Where I live, this type of approach is more common since (modern) PCs are seen as a luxury still.",Neutral
Intel,I had a similar problem with my 12600k when i was using a 5070 ti. The game is heavy on the cpu and with that combo there is already a cpu bottleneck. Increasing settings actually helped keep the fps more stable. But the only thing that really worked was frame generation. I bought a better cpu and now its a much better experience.

Intel,9800x3d.  14700k should be more than enough though if you go that route.,Neutral
Intel,"2k or 200k res is pretty much irrelevant as long as you are not gpu bound. If someone else is getting similar fps with better system but same gpu you can achieve those too with the ram switch. So short answer, no, because there is no point anyone benchmarking at those for people who primarily care about achieving x (or as high) fps. If you are looking for an easy solution without changing anything, you can always consider using frame generation.",Neutral

Intel,Get an Intel arc b580 its amazing for 250,Positive
Intel,"Those are chill games. Get an arc B580, used RX 6700 XT, or used RTX 3070.",Positive
Intel,"for 1080p gaming with mods, you don't need something crazy. A 3050 or even a used 2060 should do the trick and save you some cash. The 4070 is nice but might be too much for what you’re working with right now... Look at gputiful for price and performance comparisons; their core table can help you figure out what’s a good buy for the games you’re playing.",Neutral
Intel,Do you plan on using ray tracing ever? Will you ever change the screen resolution? What’s your budget?,Neutral
Intel,A 9060xt 16gb would keep you happy at 1080p for a long time if that would be in budget.,Positive
Intel,doesnt it have bad drivers?,Negative
Intel,Pardon me for being curious but why is it amazing?,Positive
Intel,"Not really. I plan on upgrading but that's like 3 years down the line. I don't really care for DLSS, ray tracing yada yada.. just need raw proformance best bang for buck but still cheap because my monetary ceiling is low.",Negative
Intel,I have heard about driver issues.,Neutral
Intel,12 GB of vram and almost as good as that 4070 you mentioned for 250$,Positive
Intel,I’d first check if you live close to a micro center. It pains me to recommend a gpu with 8gb vram but maybe check out the 9060xt (8gb if it’s all you can afford) or 5060 whichever you can find cheaper.,Negative
Intel,its also 20% slower and you can get a used 4060 for cheaper whilst having the same performance,Negative
Intel,How is that price possible? I know Nvidia cards tend to be overpriced but not by that much? Is Intel just undervaluing?,Negative

Intel,No idea but its a good deal,Positive
Intel,Thank you. I appreciate it.,Positive
Intel,9060xt 16gb,Neutral
Intel,I think you’d probably have to upgrade both CPU and GPU to really feel much of a performance uplift tbh both are fairly old. If anything CPU might get you more bang for your buck with the 1060 not being that bad but it also requires a new mobo and potentially a new PSU depending on what you choose.   When you start looking at it like that honestly it might be worth your while to check out some modern prebuilts with modern parts that’ll game on the “low end” of gaming specs. I put the quotation marks because the low end of modern parts is still very good for 1080p gaming and a bit uplift from where you’re at. Again though - not sure what your budget is like just some food for thought. Right now prebuilts are better prices than part buying for a PC.  If you’re dead set on only a couple parts I think you should start at CPU/mobo. Be careful where you land though if you get the most recent gens of CPUs you’ll need DDR5 ram which is an expensive af market. Again another reason that a prebuilt might be more ideal.,Neutral
Intel,9060 xt dont go intel with an cpu bottleneck,Neutral
Intel,what is your budget? what do you play? or hope to play?,Neutral
Intel,"If you're looking at used, consider a rx 7600xt, i recently made the jump from a 1060 in one of my builds to a rx 7600xt and it blows it out of the water.",Neutral
Intel,"Go as big as you can afford on GPU, the rest of the system can catch up as you free up money. Yeah you might ""bottleneck"" but it's going to be waaay better than the 1060.   I would go bigger than an 8gb card, at least a 5070.  If you don't mind doing the driver dance the Radeon 9070xt is not a wrong choice either  Might be worth finding out how hot a cpu your mobo can do and upgrade to that generation's I9. It won't be world-changing but might be affordable used.",Positive
Intel,"used 6700xt/7600xt, extra money on ram if u can",Neutral
Intel,"Nah, a GPU will go a surprisingly long way.  Heck I can experiment at home, I still have my 8700 (k for me but close enough) /1060 6gb build at home.  If I ask my son nicely he might let me borrow his 5070 and see what the benchmarks do.  I'd load up my 7900xtx in it but I don't feel like doing the driver dance",Neutral
Intel,"In your opinion, is the resulting bottleneck bearable with a 9060 xt?",Neutral
Intel,"Let's say my budget changes depending on what I get.  If I were to get a used GPU I would like to spend less or around €200.  If instead I were to get a new GPU I would prefer to stay at a maximum of €350-400.  I mostly play RPG or action games. As examples of games I would play there are Oblivion Remastered, Wukong, Expedition 33, Final fantasy VII Rebirth etc.",Neutral
Intel,Benchmarks are not a real test for this because they mostly add load to your GPU in real world scenarios you won’t see a big leap just on a graphics card alone this many generations behind. People generally buy the PC to play games not 3Dmark.. I say this as I had a top 100 3Dmark score 🤣,Neutral
Intel,Both cpu and ram are gonna bottleneck pretty hard on 1080p. 1440p would be a better fit but you could also just crank the settings or render in 1440p.,Negative
Intel,well it looks like 9060 XT 16gb is just outside your budget. I looked on mind factory and the cheapest one was €438. if you can save up a bit more then that would be your best choice  the cheapest 5060 ti 16gb was €589.  with the kind of games you want to play I would try to avoid 8gb cards. I am not familiar with used prices in europe but maybe look into a used 7600 xt? that is the model with 16gb of vram instead of 8gb. Going RDNA3 instead of 2 [would allow you to use FSR4 INT8 without resorting to an old driver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4B3vmWg9bg),Neutral
Intel,"Still should provide a ballpark idea, I've been using one called ""Superposition"" that tracks cpu usage and so on. It's not as good as sideXside game comparos; but it should be a good approximation of the relative improvement one could expect.",Neutral
Intel,I just found a XFX 9060XT Swift 16gb at 400. Do you recommend it?,Neutral
Intel,There’s quite a few videos out there showing people doing real world testing with just putting a GPU into an otherwise outdated system and it doesn’t add a ton of real world value when gaming. Pretty sure LTT who most people defer to did one.,Negative
Intel,"yeah, go for it     do yourself a favor and look up optiscaler. it will allow you to use FSR 4 in many games that don't officially support it. just don't use it in multiplayer games as it might trigger anti cheat",Positive
Intel,"An 8700 behind a 1060 has some headroom though. Plus it might be affordable to swap in a used I9-9900k to get a little improvement on the cpu side (BIOS dependent - OP will have to verify).  So personally I'd do a 9070xt and a 9900k (or maybe not, they're running like $250 on fleabay geez) and then save up for an AM5 X3D setup to swap in later.",Neutral
Intel,"Okay, I'll take a look. Thank you so much for your help.",Positive
Intel,"It's really remarkable how many ""features"" the 5060ti says it has over the 9060xt but both are really close to each other anyway and the 9060xt is much cheaper.",Positive
Intel,Nice skin/paint on the xbox btw.,Positive
Intel,"This seems reasonable. Just first thing when you get the PC, in person if you are meeting in person, boot up the system and open task manager, then check to be sure the parts are as he says. Idk if he is trustworthy just always good to check. If he gets defensive you could say something like “I wanted to make sure the ram didn’t come loose”. Other than that seems like a good deal to me, good way to get into pc gaming. At the end of the day it depends on if you prefer playing on Xbox or pc and how much you value the work you did customizing the Xbox, great job btw",Neutral
Intel,I thought it was gonna be a pc inside the Xbox and that would have been sick,Neutral
Intel,"prices he listed seem reasonable or slightly high for a few. Maybe $800-900 total, monitor is likely just trash would help to know actual specs. If it was 1080p 144hz then I suppose $60 reasonable but if it's only 60hz then I wouldn't consider it near $60.  The ram price is perhaps low given current prices though, may be more like $150 used.

Intel,It's caused by nvidia's proprietary SHARC.   Seems like another one of their deliberate sabotages of AMD.

Intel,I'm curious as to what GPU and resolution you're using where Path Tracing in Cyberpunk is viable. I tried it on a 9070XT and it's not viable at 4k regardless of FSR settings.,Neutral
Intel,The previous Adrenaline update caused massive stuttering on my 240hz monitor. I had to disable Freesync and it acted fine. I ended up reverting to an older version. I'm also wondering if Freesync issues have been resolved as they aren't addressed in the fixes.,Negative

Intel,"set frequency, voltage and power limit. and you will no longer have timeout. obviously you have to find the values ​​for your card",Neutral
Intel,nvidia's proprietary SHARC broke it (and i wouldn't put it past them if it wasn't by accident).  There's a mod available [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/25673) to disable SHARC and then it works without issue.,Neutral
Intel,Did you do any other tuning like OC/UV? Do you have a card with dual BIOS?,Neutral
Intel,It is just the stupid AMD deciding to let the card boost as long as there is a thermal headroom. My card also boosts up to 3.2ghz at stock. Lmaooo,Negative
Intel,"just amd things , use Dx11 and your hopefully having less crashing issues.  its known for wow since like 5 years , and sporadic for like 12 with wow and amd.",Neutral
Intel,"Pretty convinced this is more of a wow/windows issue then an actual driver issue. I can be on the same driver for months with no problems then they drop a wow patch or a windows update and all of a sudden the issue comes back. It has been an issue on and off since I got my 7900XTX at launch and I have thousands of hours in wow since that time. I went deep down the rabbit hole trying to find a solution but there are none that stick. When it gets bad I turn off ray tracing and that seems to reduce how often they occur but not stop them completely.  There are also people more recently having the same/similar problem on Nvidia cards too, so its not specific to brand anymore it seems.",Negative
Intel,Not one crash on wow for me,Neutral
Intel,"do you have any OCs on your Card, CPU or RAM?   It did work fine with my 7900XTX, doesn't mean it's not an AMD problem just checking :)   OC Stuff can sometimes work well in 99 games and crash on the 100th",Positive
Intel,Exactly.,Neutral
Intel,"Because the developers are lying about the game using FSR 3.1. In reality, it's FSR 3.0, which is built into the game engine, without the separate DLL files that AMD provided several years ago. Therefore, it's impossible to enable FSR4 in the game because the driver doesn't recognize the DLL files, which need to be overridden. It's completely absurd that the developers released a game in this state in 2026",Negative
Intel,Polaris got a new driver 2 weeks ago with the 26.1.1 driver.,Neutral

Intel,"Yes because fixing things is as easy to saying to a developer ""fix it"" and 5 minutes later he's done.",Neutral
Intel,They post the known issues so that people don't keep sending them reports about the same thing constantly. They will be working on a fix which can take time.,Neutral
Intel,The Nioh 3 devs are to blame for not implementing FSR3.1 properly. There is no external dll (amd\_fidelityfx\_dx12.dll) in the game directory so Adrenalin cannot hook into it to upgrade to FSR4.,Negative
Intel,do u really need it? Nioh graphics arent that intensive.,Neutral
Intel,"Nvidia drivers were just as bad last year.. Wouldn't pick a GPU based on that, personally",Negative
Intel,"no upgrade path for an 7900XTX and no  FSR4 for 7900XTX made me switch to Nvidia, and although I lost 8 gigs of Vram, for MY purposes it was a very good idea!",Positive
Intel,"Drivers is a terrible metric to judge hardware by, especially nowadays when the drivers are updated even week to week sometimes. Nvidia drivers can go from crap to fantastic in a single update, and the same applies to AMD.

Intel,Weird lighting issue. Looks like a checkerboard. Others have been having the same issue.,Negative
Intel,"I don't see any value in this software for my setup. It constantly hogs 200-300MB of VRAM in the background while offering zero interesting features, at least for the RX 7700 XT. The voltage tuning is a joke — it resets every time the driver crashes, regardless of whether the crash was caused by the app itself or unstable CPU/RAM overclocking.  Features like AFMF or Sharpening? Optiscaler does a much better job, plus it's a must-have for FSR4 in certain titles. The Hyper-RX/Quality/Power Saving profiles are pure cringe, and I'd throw Radeon Boost, Chill, and Anti-Lag into the same garbage bin. On top of that, I’ve been soft-locked several times trying to open the overlay with Alt+R; the app intercepts the input but fails to launch, freezing my cursor and forcing a hard reboot.",Negative
Intel,"Honestly, driver only works waay better for me, amd 7900xtx and rx 5 7600. With the software in any game(i mean mostly heavy games like rdr2 and returnal in 1440p) i get drops like 5-10fps, which doesn't seem a lot, but i feel it, playing at mostly high settings.",Positive

Intel,No?,Neutral
Intel,"there were like so many points and lines in the night raids or electromagnetic storms, was very weird.",Negative
Intel,"If you are on a 4k display then you can use optiscaler to render at a custom resolution i.e instead of fsr4 performance mode which renders at 1080p, you can change it to render slightly lower like 960p or 847p ect. It still looks better than playing at 1440p Quality/balance mode. Combine with using RIS2 and a slight overclock, the performance is not bad at all.  You could also just use fsr4 performance mode at 3200x1800, overall better experience than playing at native 1440p.  Path tracing even without any additional help from NRC, Ray regeneration and the help of the devs optimisation is still a viable option on the 9070xt.  There are some good resolutions in-between 1440p and 2160p to explore.",Positive
Intel,"There's also a PT mod called ultra plus or something, I think it reduces the light bounces (image looks almost the same)  Mod could push the game above 60fps",Positive
Intel,"1440p with FSR 4 balanced on a 9070xt is very playable, especially on a controller. You can even drop to FSR 4 performance mode and it's still okay, although it starts to get a bit more shimmery.",Positive
Intel,Which version btw i might try it,Neutral
Intel,"Blame Cd Projekt Red, there's other games that use the tech (Doom Eternal, Indiana jones, Blackmyth) that work fine on AMD cards  (and it's supposed to be at least compatible with all cards that support DirectX raytracing), but it's only Cyberpunk that's crashing",Neutral
Intel,9000 series man. You have a 6950xt.   And can confirm that my 9070xt crashes all the time with CP2077 PT on.,Negative
Intel,What's your frame rate? 15? Lol jk.. my 7800 sapphire nitro overclocked heavy still struggles with path tracing on CP and fsr,Neutral
Intel,This game is broken. My thoughts about this - after reinstalling drivers you have two Hogwarts Legacy folders in app data with compiled shaders and the game just cannot solve it so it crushes.   Just delete those folders manually and the game will compile shaders again as it should from the beginning.,Negative
Intel,"I don't think it was done on purpose. It's just unfortunate that a certain feature is clashing with how rdna4 handles path tracing. I tried cyberpunk path tracing on my 7800xt previously numerous times and didn't get any crashes, the only issue was a lack of performance.   This fix looks like it has to come from the developers side. And we know their priority is for Nvidia.",Negative
Intel,"tbf Nvidia sabotaging AMD is very likely, wouldn't be the first time.   But it's also very likely AMD just doesn't have or want to spend the ressources to get that resolved, lol.   As far as I read in this thread AMD still has issues with Warhammer 40k Darktide although the devs have contacted them a year ago.",Negative
Intel,"I just got the card recently so I haven't done too much tuning yet. Unfortunately it doesn't have a dual BIOS (RX 9070 Challenger). But it's annoying that my drivers are consistently crashing at stock settings, and I see HWInfo reporting the clockspeeds going way above the stock values.",Negative
Intel,"It may very well be a wow problem, but when it occurs in games using completely different engines, I feel it's more of a driver issue.  I don't play WoW with raytracing, even then, I tried many different option types and the crashes still happen.   I've come to the conclusion some time ago that I can't fix it and I just have to live with random crashes until either Blizzard or AMD does something.",Negative
Intel,"It crashes regardless of OC or not, my buddy with a 7800XT gets the same errors and it doesn't matter whether it's Retail or Classic WoW or whether it's directX11 or 12, low or highest setting. Unfortunately I don't ever think I will get a fix, despite reporting the error everytime.  The problem is that it's so random. I can play regularly for a month+ no problem and sometimes it crashes 3 times within an hour. Never saw it crash 4 times, yet anyway...  Only OC I have is my RAM @ 6000Mhz, but my friend has no and runs on default speed.   As said, only problem is WoW and Endfield(in some areas of the game, not all).",Negative

Intel,Is it even fsr3.1 then?,Neutral
Intel,At least nVidia has cleaned them up.  AMD's drivers just keep getting worse.,Negative
Intel,"Not true , my GF got a 3070 and installed EVERY SINGLE update.  No issues infact her performance slightly improved in certain games and got giant DLSS upgrades.  Meanwhile the 6800XT i have is my first amd GPU in like 10 years and i have DDU permanently on my PC because the driver randomly breaks in some way and i need to DDU to get it back to normal.  Like right now the amd interface wont autostart anymore ( i added it to the startup folder for now cause i dont want to DDU AGAIN )     if the memory craze wouldnt be here i would have bought THIS MONTH a 5070TI for me and my wife.",Positive
Intel,"I bought the amd 6xxx series for my two pcs but before that, I had Nvidia, and I never had issues with nvidia drivers.   Amd has always given me issues at some point when I bought em.  Had an hd 7870 that had some issue with final fantasy XIV, which was and is my main game.   The game kept crashing, so I thought the card was bad, so I rma for another card. New card same issue. So I just tell em send me whatever the equivalent Nvidia card you have. I got a 660ti, and it just worked.  Bought myself a 770 and 980ti, which both worked no issues.  The computer died right as I moved for a new job, so I just needed something cheap, so I bought an Rx580, and while it was mostly fine, it still had a few crashes.  The 3060 I got later had zero issues.  I have s 6800xt and a 6900xt and im on some older driver (like maybe 2 or 3 drivers ago) because when I update (full clean with DDU and all), i get crashes when I game.   Nvidia may have had driver issues last year, but I doubt their issues overall are as consistent as amd.  Last amd card I remember having no issues was my 5770 and my x850xt back when.",Neutral

It's not something that AMD or Nvidia specifically need to create but looking around, it seems it's still a bit a slow area in regards to AI advancements. There's DeepFilterNet but it hasn't really been updated in years though there's been a lot of claims of progress of DeepFilterNet3 with I'm assuming private branches.  As for easy for users to install there's SteelSeries Sonar but no idea of it's quality.",Neutral

Intel,"It's an optimization for PT, if anything the optimizations may have the potential to decrease the visual quality.",Negative

Intel,"Yh, some of the flaws would actually be resolved with a good denoiser. If you turn off Ray reconstruction on my 5070, shimmering/flickering is very noticeable with dlss. Ray reconstruction actually stabilize the image and can add certain details, so the upscaler is not doing all of the work visually. AMD RR would definitely be a game changer.

Intel,its just amd fan people that didnt had a nvidia gpu the last 10 years so they literally dont know that you dont experience all the issues you do on amd and just think what they read here is true that they have the same issues.,Negative
Intel,Nvidia cant make a driver that doesnt shit itself whenever windows updates so,Negative
Intel,"No thanks, I play games that don't work on Linux (yes Kernel lvl anti cheat)   Also, I'm a software dev for windows applications.   And also, what does switching to linux have to do with the whole topic?  And I need FSR 4 Because FSR 3 looks significantly worse then even XESS on it's fallback mode a lot of the times and even the 7900XTX needs upscaling for pretty much any RT game, and no I am not turning down settings on a 1200€ GPU (when I bought it)",Negative
Intel,"Yeah that sucks :c but the bonus RT performance, the WAAAAAY better upscaler + the fact that most of these software features get actually used in games, still keeps me happy",Positive
Intel,until AMD says something about it officially its pointless asking about it at every driver release.  So instead of wasting your own time focus on the driver drop what it fixes and if you have games that need support.  I'm an RDNA 3 users aswell and I don't see the point asking for this every driver release they will or will not do it just let it be.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, the problem is with 4000 and 5000 gen, check forums, they have problems with 1 year without solution (like the recent problem with hdmi that amd fixes in the next drivers), i think it's maybe because of all the new features with the app, DLSS, FG, MFG, and so...",Negative

Intel,"From the human eye, there's no visual difference. I also would be pretty confused if the visuals degraded but the performance did not at least increase.  Its like if I enable dlss ultra quality and degrade the visuals but keep the performance of DLAA, it wouldn't make much sense.",Neutral
Intel,"No. Optiscaler is not missing anything to make PT/RT stable. I think you are getting confused when dlss inputs are used and PT is enabled, Ray reconstruction is automatically enabled which doesn't work on AMD gpus, so the denoising looks grainy or not 100% rendered, which then boost performance. When xess/fsr inputs are used then Ray reconstruction is disabled, therefore only the in-game denoiser is being used and everything is rendered properly.  Optiscaler doesn't make PT anymore stable or less stable. Optiscaler produces overall better quality visuals than the in-game fsr4, because it uses the correct fsr 4 models for each quality settings. but that's it.   Disabling sharc doesn't boost performance on my 9070xt and doesn't change anything visually.",Neutral

I forgot that Steam had this community board and maybe I will find more info there and it was more info and solution.   It looked like a GPU driver problem. Like I had with Helldivers and Forza Motorsport before (both were fixed by driver update),Negative
Intel,He said that doing a driver-only install gets rid of the problem.,Neutral
Intel,"Looked into it now and apparently using Xess inputs it's fine (I can confirm, started using it and played for an hour with no crashes).. the reason I went with AMD on my upgrade is because OptiScaler exists, absolute god send.",Positive
Intel,My mistake I just realized I was referring to my desktop My framework is all already in A3 on both the APU and discreet GPU. My desktop has an RDNA 2 IGPU which I do use in some workloads and a discreet RDNA 3 GPU The annoying thing though when I used DDU of my desktop it uninstalls both drivers and when they're not in a combined driver I end up with a APU that is running the Microsoft basic display adapter driver. I like to have both working troubleshooting purposes and also just in case if I ever need a fifth monitor or need to use hybrid display mode for light if my power is out and running on a generator.,Neutral
Intel,"why would they say ""we are working on it"" if they can't do anything about it?   Yes, this problem IS caused by Nvidia.   But AMD says ""AMD is actively working on a resolution with the developer to be released as soon as possible. ""   For several month so either they are lying about working on it, or they are not able to fix this, idk what about this is true, but they can't constantly post that and expect people not to blame them lol.",Negative

Most invasive kernel-level anticheat games either don't support FSR 3.1 anyway or they don't need upscaling at all, since they're e-sports optimized games (also why are you allowing ring zero access to third party corpos?). The rest will work perfectly, which is about 95% of FSR 4 supported titles.   And yes, I agree that FSR 3 obviously looks much worse since it doesn't have any intelligent upscaling, just algorithmic voodoo stuff. But for native AA it's perfectly enough, from my own testing. For RT upscaling, though - tough luck. Only Linux or Optiscaler will help.",Neutral

If amd is able to get strix halo at a competitive price then sure it will compete but the issue is that with such a large die I don't think it is possible for them to compete in price with panther lake,Neutral
Intel,I’ll never understand why AMD is not committing to design RDNA4 based APUs and at this point I just take RDNA 3.5 as a joke because they can’t even support FSR4 on it officially nor the RX 7000 cards.  It’s like they are losing on purpose,Negative
Intel,"AMD has this “it’s good enough for a while and we’ll release something great that people will forget this happened”  Vega lasted in mobile for nearly 5 years and got RDNA2 designs. Now, it’s RDNA3.5 being built for mobile platform and betting on that to be good enough until RDNA5/UDNA bridge die designs releases (unverified rumor)  AMD also has this weird obsession with competitor naming. Sure, it’s meant to confuse buyers but it’s hurting them than helping, maybe it does help in terms of inventory.  They’re not intel-like of stagnation. They’re competing but not for us in the consumer market and we’re just getting scraps until enterprise trend die down (currently AI trend/bubble).  Well, it’s understandable as Zen designs are really focused in Epyc and scale down to Ryzen SKUs.  And the 400 series is a bad refresh when Ryzen 6000 mobile is the definitive refresh they have done, Zen 3+ and move to RDNA2. AMD could’ve done similar commitment but it’s not currently.

Intel,"The GPU doesn't matter if you don't have proper drivers and they are so far behind still Intel.   Great progress, but the drivers are still going to be the thing that makes people say no.   If intel keeps on chugging away and they work with all the DirectX games backwards and going forward.   I'm talking past DirectX games, you can't just worry about the new games there's games that are older that don't run well.   It took AMD many many years to get decent drivers, Intel I don't know if they're just focusing on hardware and not the drivers, but that so far is what's been holding it back.

Intel,"I don't understand the fuss about iGPUs? Like why do they assume the average Joe would care about an IGPU at all? That's maybe 5% of the market and even then...most of them would get a dGPU anyways.  And apart from the GPU, what's special about the CPU? Combining (Lunar Lake) efficiency with (Arrow Lake) power? Sorry but my Ryzen AI 7 350 does that already. The top of the line x9 388h is about ~10% faster in single core aka the only thing that matters and will probably be in 2500€+ laptops whereas my 7 350 is in 500€ laptops.  I tried a 285h laptop besides the AI 7 350 and not only did it run hotter and less efficient, it also felt less snappier.    And the AI 7 350 was designed as a Lunar Lake competitor anyways so it was never worse in efficiency and ahead of Arrow Lakes like the 255h in that regard.

Intel,"And the price. I used to be an AMD fan, but as soon as competition with Intel was gone, AMD raised their prices and now act as if they believe they are a luxury brand. Hope Intel gets back into the game and if Intel can slash their prices it might end-up being the right choice.  At the same price, Intel is dead on arrival. At a serious discount they will take the place of AMD. No one is buying Strix Halo for handhelds, it is too expensive.",Neutral
Intel,"Both are right/wrong.  Intel made their comparisons to Strix point because they’re in the same power class. Panther lake is much faster than Strix Point at the same power level (according to Intel, AMD doesn’t deny that) at 45W.

Intel,"> I used to be an AMD fan, but as soon as competition with Intel was gone, AMD raised their prices and now act as if they believe they are a luxury brand.

They don't care about you, they care about making money and when they have a dominant position they will exploit it.  > At the same price, Intel is dead on arrival. At a serious discount they will take the place of AMD. No one is buying Strix Halo for handhelds, it is too expensive.  Outside of that one device (Ayaneo maybe?), you're right.  But now AMD is also releasing an 8-core version of Strix Halo with the full 40 GPU CUs, which should be cheaper.  I expect that we'll see that in more handhelds at the high end.

Intel,"It's not the 4050 at 60W. The laptop they compared only allows for 30W to the 4050. Nvidia's specs for the 4050 is 35W minimum, so I don't know how Dell even got to 30W. Below a certain wattage, gpu performance decreases exponentially because a minimum level of power is required to even have the gpu turned on.   Panther Lake is built on Intel 18A, which is supposed to be much better than the 'ancient' TSMC 5nm the 4050 is built on. The 4050's cpu is also Arrow Lake, which is less efficient than Lunar Lake. Again, that skews the agenda.   You can already game on thin and light devices with discrete graphics. Laptops like Asus's G14 is only 3.3lb, but sports a 4060 which is like twice as fast as intel's new igpu. The dgpu turns itself off when on battery, and the integrated graphics takes over. Anything more intensive should be used with a charger plugged in.   In short, paying for a big igpu doesn't make much sense for anyone interested in performance. And gaming handhelds? Does anyone really care about those useless bricks for investment into integrated graphics? It's not like the cost of Panther Lake is going to be cheap when its laptops start at $1300. With that kind of money, you can get 2025 Asus Zephyrus G14 with a 5060 and blow its shit out the water. Or for those on a budget, 5050 laptops have been seen for $600.   Integrated graphics have come so far, pairing Intel's newest 18A Panther Lake with an RTX 4050 could still make a lot of sense.",Negative
Intel,"Ehh not the mayority but *all* computers use iGPUs. The thing is, for the average Joe aka 95% of the market, there won't be a difference in the usage between an Intel Iris or RTX 5090 dGPU. And the efficiency would only come into place if they would game on battery (who does that anyways) or create/edit videos (again, virtually no one would do that without a dGPU). And even then, having your laptop drained in 2 hours 15 minutes instead of 2 hours is not ""gamechanging""   So it does not affect the efficiency at all during webbrowsing, watching videos, creating documents etc.  Thats also the reason why Intel has the non X 5,7,9 which will properly be by far the more demanded version as, again, the average Joe does not care the slightest about iGPU.  And apart from the iGPU, PTL is just a tiny step up from the Ultra 200 series...",Neutral

Intel,"How are you determining that AMD has a ""lead""?  In terms of Marketshare, Intel absolutely dominates x86, especially mobility (laptops), and if you walk into a Best Buy and ask 10 random customers ""Would you ever consider buying an AMD laptop?"", five of them would ask ""What's AMD?"", another three would say ""Isn't that a budget brand?"" (Their ""awareness"" of the zeitgeist of PC hardware is stuck in 2005), and maybe, and that's a big maybe, two out of ten would have a favorable opinion of AMD hardware so long as they've been paying attention for the last few years.  In terms of budget and expenditure, in 2025, Intel spent $17 billion in R&D versus AMD's $7.4 billion, outsizing it by a large amout. Total sales for 2025 are projected at approximately $53 billion for Intel and $33 billion for AMD.  I see this all the time and I've seen it for the past 8 years.... the only place that AMD has a ""lead"" is in the mind of PC hardware enthusiasts.... because it's not in the numbers as seen above (sales, expenditure, market share, etc), and it's not in the ""mindshare"" of your average consumer.  Hypothetically speaking, we could say that in a duopoly, as with Intel/AMD in x86, the BEST situation a consumer could hope for would be an even 50%/50% split in marketshare.... this would bring about the fiercest competition and would hopefully lower prices, increase innovation, etc. (and yet another reason why any fanboy who wants their favored company to dominate is LITERALLY cheering against their own interests as a consumer) Even with AMD's seriously impressive turnaround, their capture of marketshare, their ability to compete with two of the largest companies in the world while having considerably fewer resources, they still have a very, very, long way to go before approaching 50% of the x86 market across all segments.  In fact, to get any closer to that idealistic 50/50 split, AMD would have to continue winning and Intel losing for for many more years.  In other words, fears that AMD is ""becoming what Intel used to be"" and ""getting lazy"" are not an accurate reflection of the reality.",Neutral

So performance wise panther lake should be about on par with a full powered 3050Ti laptop.  That plus more advanced ray-tracing cores, it's running doom dark ages really well, AMD is still stuck at RDNA 3.5 and ray-traced games suck on the 890M.

Intel,Lunar lake came out after strix point. It was squarely a competitor to the 890m. Amd just officially released the cut down strix point as Z2E later.,Neutral
Intel,"No, not really. Making up a ""winner"" is stupid and nothing but fanboy behavior.  A faster dGPU is generally better because you’re generally not power limited on a desktop. It doesn’t really matter whether or not you have a 5060 or 5090 or whatever.  In mobile systems it’s a huge difference.  There are entirely different power classes that don’t compete with each other. A thin and light notebook with a 15W CPU cannot have a 100W CPU in it.  Panther lake aims towards unplugged performance which is the 45W power class and the same as Strix Point.  Strix Halo is a much higher power class that requires a laptop to be plugged in permanently for the full performance.  It’s for mobile desktops that are usually plugged in but can be mobile for some time with heavily degraded performance.  It’s an entirely different class of product and you won’t find (many) devices where Strix Halo and Strix Point/Panther Lake compete with each other.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, i am gonna contend that either that is wrong, and is the 4xe version, or that intel basically lied on their benchmarks.  If none of those two things are true, Intel's new graphics architecture will absolutely dominate in the next round of discrete graphics GPUs.  with B580 intel needed \~80% more silicon to match nvidia performance. Now they need \~10-20% less die area. meaning their performance per transistor basically doubled gen/gen. which is unheard of. Even maxwell (largest architectural uplift in the history of GPUs in the last 10 years) did not achieve anything close to that. And it was a massive overhaul with huge changes.

And I do understand what you're talking about (not to mention that Strix Halo can't even take SODIMMs), but nobody else talks like that. When you call it an ""octa-channel"" chip, what people read is that it has as much bandwidth as a Threadripper Pro, because that is how [AMD is marketing those chips themselves](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/workstations/ryzen-threadripper.html).",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, and AMD says Strix Halo has four channels in their customer facing spec as well, because they have 128b and 256b buses respectively. They use the 64b channel convention as it is a customer facing spec, that doesn't meant they actually have that many channels in hardware.   The Pantherlake datasheet isn't public yet, but you can see plainly in the [actual spec sheet](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/memory-controller-mc/) for Arrowlake H that it supports 8 channels of LPDDR5X (additional [spec](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/supported-memory-modules-and-devices/) for channel width).

You cannot gang these channels into a dual channel mode, that is not how modern memory works, and there is no allowance in the LPDDR5 spec for 64b channels. The 16b channels have separate command/address buses and burst for a sufficient length (32n) to fill a cache line with each access.  To be clear I think standardising on 64b ""channels"" for marketing specifications is a good thing, it allows quick mental calculation of memory bandwidth without having to get into the nitty gritty.

Panther Lake's cpu is built on the most advanced silicon process node 18A, designed to compete against TSMC's N2 (2nm) which is set to release in products in the second half of 2026. Panther Lake's gpu is built on TSMC N3E, a significantly more efficient N3. The 4050 is built on a custom 2020 TSMC 5nm variant, and Arrow Lake is built on TSMC N3+6nm. Arrow Lake is designed for specifically for high power use vs the low Lunar Lake and Panther Lake.   The future of integrated graphics is truly bright. I can see it being exactly where it is now.

I recently got a 9070xt and have been overall very impressed, but its achilles heel seems to be ray tracing. This isn't exactly surprising to me, as I researched my GPU options to death before buying one, and the general consensus is that Nvidia is stronger in the ray tracing department. But if I were to boot up, say, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, a game that supports ray tracing at 60 fps on the base Play Station 5, could I expect it to perform better than a similarly demanding game that wasn't particularly optimized for AMD hardware?  It's largely hypothetical question, as I already own the GPU, am satisfied with the GPU, and of course did my due diligence before buying the GPU so I would know exactly what to expect. But I just haven't really heard much discussion of what, if any, overlap we get optimization-wise for games that were optimized first and foremost for the AMD-based Play Station 5.",Neutral

Now my RX 9070 XT is not detected at all in BIOS or Windows Device Manager, and I only get display output from the motherboard.  WHAT HAPPENED To see the old SATA SSD in the boot menu I had to enable CSM in the BIOS. Booting into that drive resulted in a black screen.

So I said screw it, I'm gonna rebuild my PC and switch to AMD.   So I bought a MSI x870e Tomahawk Wifi Mobo, and Ryzen 9950x3d. I assembled everything, and it posts first try. Great. So I install Windows 11 and get to configuring things, removing bloat, etc, and I start having freezes. And my screens blinking off and a message telling me there was a failure and that it needs to put the graphics into safe mode.   On top of that, I was having a lot of random hiccups and lag. I checked with LatencyMon and was having all sorts of DPC latency with my Nvidia drivers. So I uninstall the drivers with DDU and install an older driver (566.36) and cool, things seem more stable. Except they're not. Now I'm getting high latency from other drivers like storage and network. So I'm thinking okay maybe it's the ram. So I run memtest86 overnight only to find my PC shut off at some point. I figured the ram must be faulty. So I took out one stick and tested it with the other and the test completed. I'm thinking okay, ram stability could explain a lot of things, so I've found the issue. So I stay with one stick and up the DRAM voltage to 1.35 to see how it goes.   I'm still getting intermittent latency. Some programs crashing, and on top of that, my PC won't shut down now. When I press shut down, my screens turn off and it seems like it's off, but my fans and light and everything else are still running. So I have to hold the power button to shut it down.   I am suspicious of my PSU because I think it could cause some of these issues, but I've had this PSU only since 2023 and it's a Corsair HX1000i.   The only things I kept from my old build were the PSU, GPU, and ram. And considering both systems were having issues, it makes sense that maybe one of them is acting up. But I don't really know if that explains all the problems I've been having.

I've set my PBO limits and a thermal limit of 85°C in the BIOS (MSI motherboard). Everything works fine until I undervolt my GPU via Adrenalin. ​The moment I apply GPU settings, the software automatically toggles the CPU section to ""Custom/Overclock"" and locks the voltage around 1.3V - 1.35V. This completely ignores my BIOS PBO limits and thermal throttle settings. As a result, while my GPU stays cool, my CPU starts hitting 90°C+ in mostly every game, even though it should be capped. ​The worst part is: if I hit ""Reset to Default"" in Adrenalin to stop the CPU madness, it also resets my EXPO profile, dropping my RAM speed from 6000MHz to 4800MHz. ​Summary of the mess: ​GPU Undervolt active = CPU overheating (Software overrides BIOS PBO). ​Resetting Adrenalin = RAM speed drops to 4800MHz. ​MSI Center is not active/uninstalled. ​How can I force Adrenalin to STOP touching my CPU/RAM settings while keeping my GPU undervolt active?

Intel,"Thank you for your reply!  Price difference for me between the 5700x and the 5800x is 10 euros so cost isn't something to consider in my case. I'll look up thermals to see if it makes a difference. The benchmark you linked is so helpful for my purposes, kudos!",Positive
Intel,"Thanks bud. It's the actual AMD card branded 6950xt, some people mis name it as a founders edition. I'll.try reach out to AMD today.",Neutral
Intel,Turns out my MOBO was bunk. Swapped it out and all Gucci.,Neutral
Intel,"It's good that it doesn't happen constantly, but even if those readings occur occasionally or intermittently, it's generally not a good sign.  However, if it hasn't happened again today, and you're under similar or identical workloads to when you had those readings, you probably have nothing to worry about. It could just be a few inaccurate readings.  Continue to monitor your CPU temperatures and, if you notice occasional readings over TJmax again, it's worth checking your current thermal management (thermal paste, contacts, etc.) and cooling setup (fans, AIOs, and/or liquid cooling). Prevention is better than cure.",Neutral
Intel,"The Radeon RX 9060 XT offers the highest raw frame rates at 1080p, outperforming the competition by roughly 4-5% on average.  The RTX 5060 provides nearly identical performance but adds the advantage of DLSS 4 for superior upscaling and image quality.  While the Intel Arc B580 is the slowest card, its 12 GB of VRAM allows it to handle Ultra settings that cause the 8 GB cards to stutter.  Ultimately, the video recommends the 16 GB version of the RX 9060 XT as the best long-term choice for modern gaming.",Positive
Intel,Had to sell the 6600 XT and went for the 9060 XT 16GB to play at 1440p. I’m loving it,Positive
Intel,I got my 8GB 5060Ti open box excellent BestBuy for $309. It was brand new.,Positive
Intel,"Bought a 9060XT 8GB for 247e (renewed on Amazon, Black Friday stuff) and sold the temporary 4060 non-TI 8GB for 220e on marketplace. Good deal...",Positive
Intel,Personally out of the 3 I'd pick the 5060. Transformer model is but better than FSR4 at 1080p,Positive
Intel,Only compares 8GB cards from teams red and green since it’s only considering <$300.,Neutral
Intel,😮🫳🍿,Neutral
Intel,"I found an openbox 9060 XT 16GB at Microcenter for $305 and jumped on it. Very impressed so far, especially with undervolting.       I have the Powercolor Reaper model and it is legitimately impressive that they were able to make it that small.",Positive
Intel,"I feel like the HUB guys are going too hard with their VRAM crusade. Why recommend a GPU that's slower now just because it might be faster in the future?   A slight downgrade in render resolution or texture quality is hardly even noticeable, and with looming shortages I feel like most studios are going to start optimizing for lower VRAM further reducing the long term disadvantage of 8GB GPUs.",Negative
Intel,"The real answer, buy a used 2080ti. Usable VRAM, DLSS4, it still is 250W so it can run on most PSUs.  It is the most balanced option if you can't afford a 9060XT 16GB.",Positive
Intel,"all of them are power hungry junk, where are good cards?",Negative
Intel,real hero here,Positive
Intel,"Intel is on the right path, but they need to start using 384-bit memory interfaces on 12GB cards instead of the 192-bit memory interface they used on this card.",Neutral
Intel,Does the 9060xt with fsr have higher performance than 5060 oc edition No Ti with dlss? And by how much?,Neutral
Intel,"The 5060 will crush, without less than a 40 percent difference, from dlls alone. Then add frame gen. WOW I can't believe you can get away with this.",Positive
Intel,5060 then cuz way better in AI  5% performance cut to gain 2x-3x AI speed,Positive
Intel,What processor are you using with 9060 xt?  Is it the same as you were using with 6600 xt?,Neutral
Intel,"Can you tell me how well it runs games at 1440p? Have you played some of the demanding ones like Black Myth Wukong, Stalker 2, etc? Do you play at medium? high? I assume FSR is always on.   And also what's your target FPS? Would really appreciate the feedback, because I have the same card and I'm thinking on switching to 1440p but I don't know what monitor would be good refreshrate-wise",Neutral
Intel,"Honestly? Pretty decent deal for a 8GB model, considering how the 16GB cost around 450$ these days, almost double the price.",Positive
Intel,"Well yeah, the cheapest RX 9060 XT 16GB is [$380](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/video-card/#c=596&sort=price&page=1&P=11811160064,51539607552) and the cheapest RTX 5060 TI 16GB is [$430](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/video-card/#sort=price&P=11811160064,51539607552&c=593). When you're comparing $300 GPUs, you're not going to bring up a GPU that's nearly another hundred dollar.",Neutral
Intel,"That would be a completely new phenomenon if you look at the past. Sure, some (probably indie) studio will optimize their games, but they would have done so already because they care about their customers.  Nothing will change with the current devs or tech, it's just a temporary issue that memory is that expensive. The prices will be lower in 2027, or we'll get used to it and buy more expensive stuff.",Neutral
Intel,"6 ish year old product that is out of warranty from some rando, is not exactly comparable here and definitely not a ""real answer""",Negative
Intel,"Dunno why you're being downvoted, the 2080 Ti is still very good value for the price and often has good OC headroom. Beats 5060 in most cases and you're right about 11GB being decent",Positive
Intel,The real answer is to stop being cheap and spend money on your hobbies.,Neutral
Intel,you tell us,Neutral
Intel,Why do power requirements matter?   Electricity costs pennies,Negative
Intel,So many think memory bandwidth matters more than it does. The 5060 ti has less bandwidth than the B580. Architecture matters a lot.  More bandwidth would do next to nothing for it.,Negative
Intel,AMD cards have upscaling and framegen as well...,Neutral
Intel,"Can you elaborate what do you mean by ""AI speed""?",Neutral
Intel,No. Dlss and frame gen is much less impactful in terms of performance boost at the low end and the latency is more noticeable. It’s also half the vram.,Negative

Runs very cool and quiet, never hitting above 65°C on closed room 20°C ambient temperature, my case sounds the same as a 20"" metal fan at speed 1, which is the same white noise that helps me sleep at night, an upgrade compared to my old RX 6600 during the summer lol.  Not sure if this helped or way too late, just wanted to comment anyways.",Neutral
Intel,"yeah seriously, here b580 is noticably cheaper for example.",Negative
Intel,"Yeah, I just wanted to point it out because there’s people like me to whom prices in dollars means nothing (or who don’t read the title) and then waste time watching an irrelevant video (though I skipped to the conclusion so not that much time).🙂",Negative
Intel,"Point being? If a cap blows because it's old any repair shop can fix it, If it's a fan dying you can fix that yourself.  On the other side there's not much the warranty can do for running out of VRAM.",Negative
Intel,"In this economy? It doesn't make any sense to not keep perfectly usable hardware that does the job just fine out of a landfill.   A 2080ti or a 3070 or AMD equal is more than enough performance for most people. Easily, and is way better bang for your buck.",Neutral

Intel,"Correct, but they do not have commercial dlss support. How many games do you not have the ability and ww do?   Thanks for the dowmvotes nvidia. Amd brainwashed.   Just to let you know: you have all been played. Look closer.",Negative
Intel,"They're seemingly referring to the speed of running LLMs locally using that GPU, unless I'm also out of the loop. A good sub to look into that stuff would be /r/LocalLLM   I wouldn't recommend doing that with a 5060 but the 16gb version must be the best choice in that price range and would handle the very small models easily and the small ones with a little slowness.",Neutral
Intel,"News flash: We're always in ""this economy"". I know someone who works at a fucking McDonalds, has a kid, and spends more money on his hobbies than you do.",Negative
Intel,nothing global about it,Neutral
Intel,"So you prefer low power for lower heat and smaller size.   I'm not space conscious, so those things don't matter.   What's with messy cables? The PC sits under the table, so it also doesn't matter how ugly it is.",Negative
Intel,"Well actually people have been modding games to put FSR where neither AMD or NVIDIA added official support.   Pretty much every game had amd nvidia and even intel upscaling these days.   In fact, when i still had my 3080ti, i was able to use AMD’s framegen in many games (cyberpunk, dying light, talos principle) because NVIDIA didnt provide any option for 3000 series.   I still bought nvidia because amd doesnt offer any cards at 5080 level, so no brainwashing here. You’re completely uneducated blinded by consumerism",Neutral

I, in all seriousness, would not be surprised if you know about that mod from ME.   Therefore, I am not blinded. I simply understand that an entire company propped up by manipulation on social media (and GPU) should not exist, and a real competitor would be in their place.

If you don't mind using dlss and mfg? 5060ti 16gb all day for 1440p or lower.

Intel,"u/AMD_Vik Hey there! Just want to let you know that I've seen a lot of people have problems lately (including myself) with Direct-to-Display/Directmode implementations for DisplayPort/HDMI wired VR Headsets. DirectMode cannot enable reliably even on SteamVR native HMDs, and the only way to get them running right now is by installing a older driver version, enabling directmode there, and then updating to a newer version with the directmode already set -> so directmode itself still works fine, but there seem to be problems toggling into this. I also saw this happening with other VR compositors like PimaxPlay though radeon users are generally not as common there.  Happens with every driver released after and including 25.4.1 on my machine, and driver older than 25.3.1 can toggle into Directmode just fine. It is still broken as of 25.12.1 and 26.1.1  at first I thought this was a somewhat individual issue but as I've looked into it I saw more and more people have that problem with RDNA3 and RDNA4 GPUs across the board for basically any VR headset that uses Directmode.

If this isn't your department, would it be possible for you to pass it on or redirect me to someone in that department?   I recently did a fresh Windows install, and during a Windows update, the AMD 32.0.21030.2001 driver was installed and worked incredibly well regarding audio and image quality (video & overall). Audio quality, specifically, is still the best I've heard from any AMD driver to date.  I thought maybe the fresh install itself might have been the reason for the better audio quality, so I installed an adrenaline driver that I'm very familiar with, and was disappointed because the audio was noticeably worse. I've now tried every driver besides 25.12.1 & 26.1.1, and the audio quality is substantially worse compared to 32.0.21030.2001.",Neutral

Intel,"I just want to say I think I found the culprit. It also happens on the winupdate one too, because it started crashing all the time.  Core clock boosts itself WAY past what it is declared on the card(I got a Sapphire 9070XT Nitro, supposed to be 3060MHz). Here's the moment before it crashes to a black screen:  [afterburner screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/3YpJFtzM/Screenshot-2025-12-21-030537.png)  The dip in clocks is the moment it crashes. As you can see, it is running well above boost clocks. Hence, freezing in a few minutes, proceeded by a black screen, and a crash. The ups and downs are from me alt tabbing in the graphs, by  the way.   This is with core clock -200mhz applied in Afterburner and no crashes, boosts to just above declared boost clocks. Here the dips in up and down on power are probably me toying around how much exactly -mhz is needed.

Is this directly driven through dGfx or system IO? - Is this on a mobile system like a laptop or handheld device? if so, can you tell me which model? - Are these subjective assessments of audio quality or are you factoring hard metrics like latency etc?  if you remove adrenalin, WU should step in and serve you their latest WHQL driver.

Intel,"Most of the conversations happened across various discord servers, so I cannot directly link them, but I also found a few posts here on reddit that seem to point towards the same direction which roughly match with the timeframe.

As far as headsets are concerned, I know at least Valve's implementation seems to suffer from this (I know about cases involving the Valve Index, Bigscreen Beyond and Vive Pro 1, all using Valve's implementation), but somebody in the pimax subreddit community discord seemed to have the same problem, which he also was only able to fix by rolling back the drivers.  I could propably reach out to a few more affected people over discord and encourage them to get active here, if you'd like.

Intel,"Hi - I am having this problem. I wanted to try the special ROCM driver so dutifully did a clean install as suggested.  Tried to launch SteamVR and it errored. Realised headset had reverted to being a monitor, running at low resolution (less than recommended) Increased the resolution to recommended (combined resolution of the two panels), and SteamVR started detecting the headset - though promoted to enable direct mode. Pressing the button to enable it restarts SteamVR, but then prompts again, and HMD is still a monitor.   Interestingly reverting to the RDNA 4 release driver, it instantly worked - Direct Mode was enabled without me having to toggle.  So it is like SteamVR is successfully toggling something, but the newer AMD drivers ignore whatever it is doing/don't act on it. As soon as older driver is installed, it does act on it, and the HMD disappears from Display Settings/stops being treated as a monitor.  This wouldn't affect the majority of SteamVR users who are streaming to a Quest, and it wouldn't impact people who upgrade to a newer driver without a cleanup.  It would affect people doing fresh installs with a recent driver, and people who do clean driver installs/use DDU.",Neutral

Intel,issue persists in the newest 26.1.1 update....,Neutral
Intel,OK thanks.,Positive
Intel,"First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to listen/read and look into this, I appreciate it greatly. I'm not sure why, but it seems your reply about the issue possibly being related to ISR isn't showing up on here for some reason. Could just be the site being dumb.  So, the audio differences I'm hearing aren't related to functionality, or the ability to playback audio without interrupts (dropouts, clicking, popping, choppiness). That has been flawless, for me, which is great. I'm referring to audio fidelity differences between drivers.  For instance, I uninstalled the driver I've recently been testing (25.12.1) via DDU and listened to some music with just the Microsoft display adapter being used as the driver. The audio sounded pretty normal again, and what I would consider correct/good. I then ran windows update, and it thankfully installed the 32.0.21030.2001 driver. Listened to some music, and as I heard before, it's still the best sounding driver I've used. The only other driver I've used that comes close is 25.1.1. That one has some slight issues with audio fidelity and image quality, but it was close enough to correct at the time.   The only thing I can think of that sounds similar and would describe what I'm hearing with these newer drivers is when you have a bit-depth and sampling rate mismatch between your music and output device. I have my audio devices set to 16/44.1 in windows, but with these newer drivers (25.9.1-25.12.1), the audio sounds as if the bit depth and sampling rate are set to higher values, even though they aren't. It's extremely strange, and sort of difficult to explain, but that's what I'm hearing.   The frustrating and unfortunate reality that might be coming into play here, is that differences could also vary between systems. So, a bad sounding driver on my system (25.9.1), might possibly sound fine or even good on a different system with different components.  It could also be caused by or related to interactions between code or the registry entries of different programs on the system interacting with drivers, but that's above my level of understanding. I'm just a dude who is noticing stuff (audio & video) and would like others who are smarter and more skilled to look into why there are differences in the first place and what could potentially be causing them.    By the way, you guys have been doing a great job with the video/image quality of these recent drivers. They are substantially better and closer to reference than everything previously released. 25.9.1 and 25.11.1 are the best drivers I've tested/used, in regards to video & image quality.",Neutral

Intel,"Ah gotcha. To be fair, I would say the differences between these more recent drivers are much smaller now compared to the drivers released in 2023, 2024, and 2025. Especially trying each driver from 25.9.1 to 25.12.1, specifically the audio, seems to get better with each release. It seems the team, or someone, also heard what I did with the 25.9.1 driver and tried to fix/improve it with each subsequent driver release.   I haven't tried 26.1.1 yet, but I will to test and compare. I'll also install LatencyMon to see if there is a correlation between good/bad audio and latency.  It really seems like the team that handles the display/video side of the drivers has mostly corrected the issues that were present with the old drivers (video output format/range, luminance levels, gamma curve, sharpness, white point, grayscale & color accuracy). There are still differences, but I wouldn't get too worried about it.  The oddball out of the bunch is 25.8.1. The audio is actually pretty good, but different. Sounds as if there is a surround sound effect turned on, or the audio output format is surround sound instead of stereo. It works really well for gaming, but music sounds a little strange. Due to the overall frequency response balance, it's honestly not bad. If it wasn't for the video/image quality side of things, I would probably use that driver.   On the video side, I think there is something wrong with the gamma curve and color. The gamma curve tracks higher (darker) in the lower luminance range. The white point and grayscale are more blue than neutral gray, and the overall color saturation is reduced, as if the color gamut clamp in the adrenaline software is being used. I checked to see if this was the case with my colorimeter, but the color gamut is normal for my monitor, so the actual color volume isn't being reduced. Very strange, but interesting.",Positive

Intel,"Are y'all playing on televisions? HDMI isn't really optimal for modern monitors, with DisplayPort being the better spec for computer graphics.  Not criticizing, just curious as to use-case.",Neutral
Intel,You try install last chipset driver ?,Neutral
Intel,"Bummer you're having issues. Hopefully AMD gets it straightened out for you. Out of curiosity, why did you decide to use HDMI on your monitor instead of display port? I thought HDMI was mostly used for TVs nowadays.",Negative
Intel,So it's the driver that's why that happens 😡 and it's not fixed?,Negative
Intel,Thank you for your service,Positive
Intel,"I've had the ""device_hung"" error and the best drivers are those you are on.   AMD needs a lot of help with their drivers...",Negative
Intel,Any update mate?,Neutral
Intel,"No, radeon drivers update cannot upgrade your CPU so that it would stop bottlenecking your GPU.",Negative
Intel,"Had the same issue, just ddu and reinstall the drivers manually, problem now is with my hardware monitor screen not working, I have an aorus board with an internal hdmi, that is not being detected, will try to reinstall chipset drivers",Negative
Intel,"multi gpu? got the same problem with rx 6400 + 7900xtx. plugging in my secondary display to 7900xtx fixed the issue, but what's the point of secondary gpu if its not working properly...",Negative
Intel,"Workaround:  Win+P and disable the second Monitor in iGPU, then start adrenaline and you can enable the second monitor again  software should be okay then",Neutral
Intel,"I'm the opposite, I just want adrenaline app to stop everytime I right click on desktop or open file explorer.... Bruh",Negative
Intel,"yeah same, my experience with 25.10 was terrible, had to DDU it once to get back my CPU metrics in Adrenalin, then DDU’d it again to go back to 25.9.2 since games were stuttering.",Negative
Intel,Same.,Neutral
Intel,"Not stable, ddu install 11.1 and lag in old dx11 mmo game(BDO)  Same as 10.2, 9800x3d with 7900xtx, i can keep 144fps in town , 11.1like  fps 60-65 and lag spikes  Im go back to 9.1",Negative
Intel,"Both 10 and 11 are shit with 7xxx series, myself and most others have gone back to 9.1 or 9.2. Might be alright with the 9070, might not",Negative
Intel,I'm playing it on 7900 GRE with FSR4 INT8 with no issues.,Positive
Intel,na it works the problem only occures when using PathTracing and you are not going to play on an AMD card with PT anyways and especially not a 7700XT,Negative
Intel,"I played recently the latest patch of Cyberpunk 2077 with RX 7700 XT with drivers from February this year, 25.2.1 and had no issues, no stutter, no lag, no crashes, the problem is with path tracing or ray tracing something, you don't have to use that even and it lowers fps probably for very little visual gain.",Positive
Intel,If it still crashes set RTX Global Illumination to Static.,Negative
Intel,"pretty sure anti lag was causing my system to freeze up when in arc raiders on 25.10. turned it on and issues, turned it off and haven't had issues since",Negative
Intel,"Optimizing has nothing to do with fixing crashing, generally, that would be bug fixing.",Negative
Intel,"The only Redstone component that will work through the driver for upgrading existing features (like FSR3 FG) will be ML FG, but only for games that have FSR 3.1.4+(and FSR FG), as they’ve already announced in a GPUOpen article quite a while ago.   Ray Regeneration (RR) and Neural Radiance Cache (NRC) require dev implementation since they’re much deeper in engine code/inputs.",Neutral
Intel,"Does BO7 have ray tracing? Where is that feature mentioned, would be keen to read about it 🤓",Positive
Intel,"Itll probably work through optiscaler, but a game like indiana jones has locked dlss inputs, so you need dev implementation",Neutral
Intel,"And all my USB devices dropped for a while, far worse experience than the usual double screen flicker & it's done.  Edit: seems like that was because of iGPU driver for my Zen4. In the end and after 6+ reinstalls, I'm stopping on 25.9.1 and have Vulkan working again.",Negative
Intel,What is wrong with CP? Just got my 9070 after 10+ years of nvidia :o   Ah nvm i see it.,Negative
Intel,Ugh,Neutral
Intel,"Most likely when your distro provides a kernel update.  I'd give this a quick read: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-update-and-see-what-graphics-driver-you-have-on-linux-and-steamos/  Pretty much the default is that you will be using the Mesa driver collection and they were last updated yesterday.  The fixes there do not correlate with the ones in this thread (I think).  As long as you are on a ""cutting edge"" type distro then you can expect that update in the next few days/weeks.  If you are on a ""stable"" distro that doesn't update often, you may be waiting a realllly long time.",Neutral
Intel,"Get what exactly? Features? Bug fixes? Optimizations?   Every 2 weeks there are new Mesa driver updates with bug fixes and performance optimizations. As for features, you have to wait a few months for versions with big numbers (25.2 is soon updating to 25.3, adding Anti-lag 2).   Depending on your distribution, you can get these updates faster or slower.",Neutral
Intel,"Linux doesn’t work like windows. You get updates directly via Mesa stack. When your distro provides mesa package update, that’s when you get driver updates, and they’re completely different from windows branch.",Neutral
Intel,just uninstall it I prefer manual check myself.,Negative
Intel,So AMDs default driver overclocks and doesn’t reflect that in the values?,Neutral
Intel,Same issues here i underclocked it but this new update just made it worse,Negative
Intel,ok it is still crashing ... complete reboot :(,Negative
Intel,"I feel like that crash is more on DICE's side, since Nvidia users get the same exact crash, although less often.  I tried everything I saw on the internet, nothing really works. Sometimes I can play for hours on end, other time game just crashes randomly after 10-15 minutes.  I am going to try to downgrade to 25.9.1 and see how it fares, since I remember that driver being really stable for me (6800XT).  Edit: been playing for 4 hours, no crash yet. Never had such a long session without the game crashing.  Will update in the next few days.  Edit 2: haven't crashed once, been playing at least 2 hours every evening.",Negative
Intel,Okay.,Neutral
Intel,I’m hoping Valve’s new steam machine will push them on that since it’s RDNA3 based.,Neutral
Intel,The RT/PT reflections leading to CTDs issue? We're working with CDPR to resolve this - it's not caused by the driver software.,Neutral
Intel,"Stuff like this is honestly bugging me.  First AMD card and while it is okay to have some driver issues, stuff like that shouldn't be a thing at all. It can't be that some bugs keep existing for multiple months let alone more than half a year.",Negative
Intel,A much more fundamental thing like playing video in a window without stuttering took 3 or 4 driver updates.,Neutral
Intel,"> One year already...Cyberpunk 2077 not fixed yet.  On year, I did not know.  I was thinking of a 9070XT earlier in spring, but choose... differently",Negative
Intel,welcome to amd,Positive
Intel,Yeah hoping it works. I guess the point about crashing with easy anticheat was the fix? Doesn't specifically mention but it was with raytracing enabled I was getting the crash. I suppose we shall find out.,Neutral
Intel,"Weird. I was running 10.2 and things were running fine for the most part. I kept getting a pop-up on launch saying there was a known issue with that driver and Arc Raiders though, so I rolled it back to 9.2 and had more issues on that release than the one with the stated problems.  My fan control profile broke and stopped tracking gpu temp so last night I did a clean DDU install back to 10.2.  Of course 12 hrs later the new release drops haha  Hopefully Fan Control continues to play nice if I just update",Negative
Intel,Same. Never even had Ryzen master installed.,Negative
Intel,"I'm receiving the same error in Event Viewer, but I have installed Ryzen Master. Most likely it's also a component of the Adrenalin drivers for system tuning and monitoring.  Registry search shows two keys for ""AMDRyzenMasterDriverV30"" (in both CurrentControlSet and ControlSet001): Computer\\HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\AMDRyzenMasterDriverV30  The ImagePath points to: C:\\Windows\\System32\\AMDRyzenMasterDriver.sys and the file exists. It's valid.",Neutral
Intel,25.2.1 had no pink artifacts on my Pure 7700 xt Sapphire but i switched to 25.11.1 and got it now also and also some flickering.,Neutral
Intel,What is redstone?,Neutral
Intel,What's weird is Black Ops 7 has ray regeneration.,Negative
Intel,"I'm afraid it may be released in January like they drop new major this year like AFMF 2 upgrade, FSR, etc..",Neutral
Intel,vsync issue fixed with win 11 KB5068861 update.,Neutral
Intel,had no issues with vsync on 25.10.2,Neutral
Intel,works fine for me,Positive
Intel,I agree.  I also have this issue  Weird is if you turn on amd overlay it fixes itself,Neutral
Intel,"That it did, lol. My only complaint.",Negative
Intel,"Not a problem on Linux with Wayland. Ever.   Main reason I ditched Windows 11, constant screen tearing and input lag made me go crazy.",Negative
Intel,The new AFMF features were added in 25.10.2 - Still waiting for AFMF 3.0 at this stage,Neutral
Intel,Suggest if you are using powertoys to stop... After their last game update it was crashing left and right. Powertoys was cause. I only crashed once and I believe it was cfeen blanking was cause for that. I was away too long.,Negative
Intel,"Fps drop over time? That's a game issue, it's got a memory leak",Negative
Intel,"What kind of FPS drops? I was having dog shit frame pacing, and hardcore drops to like sub 60 FPS at 1440p medium/high with a 6950XT. I went through every setting and found that anti-lag was the culprit. Once I turned that off it all went away. Then with future frame rendering it got even smoother. Now I can hold 100+ FPS at all times, sometimes peaking over 200 FPS in some scenarios. And frame times are smooth as butter.",Negative
Intel,I’d settle for bf6 going one entire game without drivers crashing the game and freezing pc,Neutral
Intel,"I'm also having this ""problem"" with driver 25.10.2; I haven't tested it with 25.11.1 yet.",Negative
Intel,Crashes?,Neutral
Intel,I have this problem in all games.,Negative
Intel,"Hello, I've been having this issue and I have exactly your gpu and cpu, whenever I played valorant and I alt tabed many times the screen goes black and keyboard become unresponsive but I can still hear friends in discord and they can't hear me, after conctacting valorant support and messing with alot of settings I think  what fixed it for me is to add these in windows defender exclusions : C:\\Riot Games\\VALORANT\\live\\VALORANT.exe   C:\\Riot Games\\VALORANT\\live\\ShooterGame\\Binaries\\Win64\\VALORANT-Win64-Shipping   C:\\Program Files\\Riot Vanguard\\vgc.exe   C:\\Program Files\\Riot Vanguard\\vgm.exe   C:\\Riot Games\\Riot Client\\RiotClientServices.exe   I hope this helps",Negative
Intel,"DDU was only ever for switching GPU families, e.g. Nvidia or Catalyst to Adrenalin.",Neutral
Intel,"Sad to say I am having the same issue. Did you find any workarounds, or just downgrade?",Negative
Intel,"You don't need to make it work on Adrenalin, Battlefield 6 already has FSR 4 support integrated into the game, so you don't need to override, just turn off FSR 4 from Adrenalin.",Neutral
Intel,Works on 25.10.2. I have been seeing ppl said it doesn't work on this driver. It also didn't work on 25.10.1 for me as well.,Negative
Intel,Epic version runs just fine.,Positive
Intel,Cyberpunk GOG last version patch runs fine on this driver.,Positive
Intel,"Hey there, can you give an example of how this looks now versus how it's supposed to?",Neutral
Intel,are you able to install driver only with the newest drivers? When i choose minimal or driver only it still install full version of the software anyway. Only 25.9.1 works perfectly.,Neutral
Intel,Yeah... it can happen. I was already locked outside windows after a bsod with my old nvidia card. I had to use a linux usb drive to fix it through the command line.,Negative
Intel,It's most likely the same as I've described here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1ow4in7/comment/nop2o04/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1ow4in7/comment/nop2o04/)  But yeah unfortunately seems like all you can do for now is either roll back to 25.10.2 or disable your iGPU if you don't use it,Negative
Intel,probably because those issues are build specific.  I've not had any freezing or locks on any drivers this whole year.,Neutral
Intel,"The game is booting, this message was for the 25.10 they just didn't removed it",Negative
Intel,I don't know your system specifications but in many cases setting the BIOS to PCIe v4 could help.     Try change in your bios,Neutral
Intel,no I hit alt R opens right away.  And i did an upgrade install over top of 25.10.2 no DDU or AMD clean up utility.  When you say you did a clean install was that just from control panel and remove?,Neutral
Intel,"First time yes, i downloaded with -s letter, but the last time i downloaded smth like -combined(1.6 gb). All two's is for WIn 11.",Neutral
Intel,"To be clear, are you able to confirm that VRR is disabled after you alt-tab? Do you have a display-side OSD to verify?",Neutral
Intel,"Good call, it caused nothing but problems for me and pretty severe. Were talking driver timeouts with black screens and even a couple bluescreens.",Negative
Intel,"Not even 7000s have support for FSR, you'll have to stay on 25.9.1",Neutral
Intel,My 9070 xt crushes while I try to use fsr 4 on new drivers,Neutral
Intel,Why don't you try it and let us know if you can. Would be helpful for lots of us,Positive
Intel,It's in Redstone. Still not out yet,Neutral
Intel,Didn't work for me...,Negative
Intel,Wait until you see how much your browser's cache is churning...,Neutral
Intel,Why cant you use Adrenalin? I'm using it on 25.9.1,Negative
Intel,I just received a windows extension update for my LG monitor. If you can boot up go check.,Neutral
Intel,The last time I had this problem it was a RAM issue.,Negative
Intel,I have this for my ThinkPad laptop with its internal display. Good to know I'm not the only one.,Positive
Intel,"if it happens, fill in the bug report that pops up. more reports will help AMD identify the issue better.",Neutral
Intel,I have DDUed the driver before upgrading. I still face the GPU crashes during display standby.,Negative
Intel,"Wait, chipset drivers uninstall too? I'm going to have to fix that on my system...",Negative
Intel,Do u reintall already up to date chipset drivers?,Neutral
Intel,You should use the Factory Reset installation in the AMD Driver Installer so it removes the newest AMD Adrenalin and install back the correct Adrenalin driver.,Neutral
Intel,"I don't have a DisplayPort to HDMI 2.1 adapter to try, sorry.",Negative
Intel,doing so (separation) will create a freak out shitstorm part 2.,Negative
Intel,> People misunderstand and thought its like pre rdna stuff.  It is. They've simply bundled two separate drivers together. RDNA1/2 are still stuck on the same 21033.x branch while RDNA3/4 have moved first to 22021.1009 and now 22029.1019.,Neutral
Intel,Is it combined though?  7900 XT Driver: ......amd.com/drivers/whql-amd-software-adrenalin-edition-25.11.1-win11-nov.exe (25.20.29.01 ?)  6800 XT Driver: ......amd.com/drivers/whql-amd-software-adrenalin-edition-25.11.1-win11-s.exe (25.10.33.03 ?),Neutral
Intel,All it takes is one random Reddit comment with some upvotes spreading misinformation and you will see people posting articles about it,Negative
Intel,"You have two differnt drivers installed and running at the same time, one for APU and the other for GPU? is that what you are saying?",Neutral
Intel,Combined only as far as the two driver packages are now in one file. RDNA1/2 are still stuck on 32.0.21033.x branch. RDNA3+ are on 32.0.22029.1019.,Neutral
Intel,Last driver was branched right? I never updated coz I had just fidled with the files to make FSR4 (INT8 or whatever its called run) and didn't wish to do it again...,Negative
Intel,Can we please have a fix for the 7700 xt artifacts showing? It's been ignored for so long. Using hardware acceleration on chromium (and not just that) causes pink artifacts everywhere.,Negative
Intel,Thank you for communicating,Positive
Intel,Unfortunately happens to me too. So for me it’s a big issue as I can’t update to this driver until it is fixed 😰,Negative
Intel,"I have a dual PC setup, one system with a 9070xt where I have seen this bsod related issue, mostly when toggling HDR.  The other system has exclusivly an RTX 3090 that also has the same HDMI 2.1 related system bsod, but Nvidia driver instead.   It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.   While digging into my issue, I wanted to see if DP2.0 / uhbe20  compatible display would have these issues, but my current display only has HDMI2.1 and dp1.4.  Hopefully someone else had experience with them on 4k 240hz.",Negative
Intel,Thank you AMD my bad for getting upset,Neutral
Intel,Thank you.,Positive
Intel,Any word on when noise suppression will be fixed? I would actually lowkey love a right up and why it’s failing. Would be cool to see the technical details if that’s possible. (I’m actually more interested now on why it’s not working vs just getting it fixed).,Neutral
Intel,Thank you!,Positive
Intel,There's a long-time standing issue with Chrome and hardware acceleration. Will that ever be made a priority?,Negative
Intel,Redstone when?,Neutral
Intel,"LG OLED CX and newer are good monitors.  I am using it with my PC and PS3, PS5, Blu-ray 4K Player...  I must say that that was my very first actual driver issue with AMD.",Positive
Intel,Not always true. HDMI 2.1 has more bandwidth than dp 1.4. I have a ASUS pg32ucdm and HDMI looks better and uses a lower dsc ratio. I have a Nvidia GPU in my main PC however.,Neutral
Intel,"Yes, my 9070XT is paired with a 5600X hooked up to my TV for couch gaming. I have a separate PC with a monitor for desktop gaming. My TV doesn't have DisplayPort, very few did when I bought it.",Neutral
Intel,"I currently run a gaming monitor as my primary one, with DP, and a plain old Lenovo office monitor as my second one. It only has HDMI, so i wouldnt be able to use it with DP.  I assume this may be the case for a lot of people. Getting a ""higher spec"" 2nd monitor really isnt a priority for me, as i just need a second screen for productivity when working instead of gaming.",Neutral
Intel,Non pc monitor tvs are sometimes cheaper especially for larger sizes. I’m on lg c5 oled 42inch and it only has hdmi…,Neutral
Intel,"Not universally true, hdmi and displayport depending on the version supported are very comparable.   Dp 1.4 Vs hdmi 2.1 is where hdmi has more bandwidth, before this dp was the easy choice.",Neutral
Intel,"> Are y'all playing on televisions? HDMI isn't really optimal for modern monitors, with DisplayPort being the better spec for computer graphics.  ~~Tell this to Valve, who are about to bring out a gaming-focused mini PC which **only** has HDMI 2~~",Negative

Intel,LG OLED TV as a monitor. I have LG OLED CX which comes with HDMI 2.1.,Neutral
Intel,My game keeps crashing due to the same. I want this fixed ASAP. You'd think they'd test the biggest recent releases before publishing an update.,Negative
Intel,"I am also having a ton of crashes in BF6 RedSec, but I'm not getting any errors. Game just freezes, then crashes.",Negative
Intel,"I got a new pc 2 days ago and i literally cannot downgrade my drivers without amd forcing me onto the latest, even if i download the more stable drivers directly. Got any advice?",Negative
Intel,"I kinda fixed it by turn off XMP/EXPO running the ram the lowest bus, still crash to but 1 crash every 2-3 hrs still better than 15 minutes.",Neutral
Intel,Why does it seem like driver quality/support has gotten substantially worse this past decade? Are we running out of skilled software engineers or is hardware just getting too out of hand?,Negative
Intel,there are multiple reports of lower gpu usage with 25.9 and above.. after going back to 25.8 I have 15%+ fps  I guess the constant crashing with rdna1 cards is also not related to these drivers,Negative
Intel,"Tried but didnt work, tried the 25.9.1 and get error that no Software is installed tried the auto update to 25.11.1 again and same error with open and shut down again",Negative

Intel,"I had randomly black screens with 24.2.1, this was annoying as hell. Had to DDU the Driver and went back to 23.11.1, after this everything was fine.",Negative
Intel,Does fsr 4 work on 25.9.1? I thought the only driver that works without having to change any files and risk a ban online is 23. 9.1?,Neutral
Intel,"I had to rollback to driver 25.9.1, start up Star Citizen, switch the renderer to Vulkan, exit game, start SC again to verify it's working with Vulkan, then reinstall the latest driver again. Now it works, just don't switch it back to DirectX. No idea who dropped the ball on this one but Easy-Anticheat sure doesn't like the atidxx64.dll.",Neutral
Intel,I'm not sure. However when I install the driver it states that I cannot use adrenaline and gives me a link to the newest driver. Wondering if there is an earlier version of adrenaline I need to install.,Neutral
Intel,What do you mean extension update??? Do you mean lg firmware update or something Ina  windows update? Where do I find this?,Neutral
Intel,They do not.,Neutral
Intel,"Well, I used the system before the latest updates normally, for maybe half a year. Installed every update without DDU. I wanted to triple boot, formated the drive, left windows to install stock updates and drivers, went to install chipset and GPU driver and voila, every wakeup, just before I could type the pin, kernel panic and shutdown. DDU, just the driver, installed again, black screen. Went into DDU again, wanted to see if I missed anything and without reading, uninstalled everything AMD related, went into windows, installed chipset drivers from vendors site (ASUS) and then the latest GPU drivers, and havent had issues. I have a monitor connected via DP and a TV via HDMI.",Neutral
Intel,Dont buy an adapter. Most of them are trash and dont put out the advertised resolution and refresh rate. Not to mention most of them dont support vrr or HDR.,Negative
Intel,The one linked in the release notes is combined. (in the sense that it's two drivers in one executable) (And 1.6GB)  .....amd.com/drivers/whql-amd-software-adrenalin-edition-25.11.1-win11-nov-combined.exe,Neutral
Intel,"AND is taking away one additional driver feature per day, you say?",Negative
Intel,"Yes, I’m talking about 25.10.2 (posted the other day here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/s/nNunS1QlFX ). If you go to AMD download page and select “GPU” you get a file that has a different dimension from the one you download if you choose “CPU”. If you do the following steps 1) DDU (or AMD CleanUp Utility), 2) install CPU drivers => GPU not recognized or with a generic driver. If the you install the GPU driver you get the GPU correctly recognized and a yellow esclamation mark on the integrated. To have both VGAs working at the same time I have to download the AMD Auto Detect package (the file name ends with “minimal_install), but Adrenalin App does not open.",Neutral
Intel,Thank you for explaining it before the rage baiters go nuts.,Neutral
Intel,I've been following this one pretty closely. Unfortunately the fix *just* missed 25.11.1 release cycle; we hope to get this out in the next one.,Negative
Intel,"I have a 7900XTX and have this issue at times. It normally clears quickly on its own, but seeing pink pixels on the screen worried me that I had an issue with the actual hardware",Negative
Intel,"I totally understand. if you're running with an affected display config, you should be fine on 25.9.1 or the 25.10.1 preview driver for BF6. We'll get this out as soon as we can.",Neutral
Intel,"Appreciate you reaching out with this - that's an interesting data point to consider.  In this case, the quirky behaviour with HDMI 2.1 + FRL was attributed to a change made in the display stack, I don't think it explicitly involves display stream compression to repro, just high enough display bandwidth (though I could be mistaken)",Positive
Intel,"Interesting. I've been experiencing random BSODs on my PC too on a fresh Win11 install too, I was also suspecting it was something to do with auto HDR toggle but I didn't know for sure.  I'm running 180hz 1440 LG panel but I don't recall if it's using hdmi or DP. I've also never experienced BSODs until the last week or two, since i did a fresh install and I've had the same monitors/PCs for a long time.",Neutral
Intel,Don't apologise - this one is worth getting upset over. Hope it's fixed for you all very soon.,Negative
Intel,Was yours the DisplayPort config or HDMI? I may have a fix for this ready if you're available test,Neutral
Intel,Can you provide me some context? Are there any posts detailing the issue either here or at the chromium project side?,Neutral
Intel,Already launched in COD 7,Neutral
Intel,"Im currently using dp 1.4 on my 7900 gre.  My monitor has 2.1 hdmi, so you’re saying i shoulf switch to hdmi?",Neutral

Intel,Are you sure? The steam machine has HDMI 2.0 and DP 1.4 listed in the specifications,Neutral
Intel,"Ah ok, that definitely makes sense if you're using a TV. Hope they straighten it out for you soon.",Neutral
Intel,What I did is get the 25.8.1 drivers shut off the fluid motion frames and in Windows set bf6 to run full power on your graphics card. Try some of those things and see if that helps you.,Neutral
Intel,"I tried to reinstall the chipset drivers, the same error, tried to install the drivers from gigabyte site the second screen worked but uninstalled adrenaline and it ran the auto update that disabled the secondary screen and the issue of no adrenaline opening came back, going back to older version, thanks AMD",Neutral

Intel,"Wait until December, there's the 5th anniversary and they'll supposedly drop something new.",Neutral
Intel,For me playing it with path tracing on eventually the game crashes. Had no issues playing with ray tracing: psycho though.,Negative
Intel,Amen to that. Not a single crash since the game released on CachyOS. (9070 XT),Positive
Intel,Thank you! Exciting keen to see what it’s like,Positive
Intel,"It has nothing to do with the lack of vulkan support, even when fsr4 comes to vulkan, the game still needs ray regeneration implementation from the devs, you cant use optiscaler through dlss inputs, like you probably will be able to in fx alan wake 2",Negative
Intel,I suppose is going to be fixed as soon as Amd Redstone go out. Basically is going to add every tecnology that Path tracing needs to work. Off course the devs would have to implement them in the game too,Neutral
Intel,"The issue is if you try to use path tracing. Which to be fair, you probably shouldn't unless the miracle of them getting Virtuous to implement Ray Regeneration in Cyberpunk happens.",Negative
Intel,yes i tried it ... maybe it is because of the 7800X3D ... i really dont know... i will wait for the next patch ... should come tomorrow 18.11. ... but i have read so many threads and i am not the only one...,Neutral
Intel,Hmm fair. For me on 9070XT if I had raytracing enabled it would crash most regularly on loading back to the menu after extraction which was annoying but at least not game destroying lol. But yeah annoying enough that I turned RT off entirely.   I hope this means I can turn it back on because the game runs well enough for it.,Negative
Intel,"Yes. So far, so good. I'm not 100% sure what fixed it.      I uninstalled both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master standalone applications. Deleted the ""amdryzenmasterv"" keys. Rebooted.  Then I installed Adrenalin and used the Ryzen Master installer in Adrenalin (Performance > Metrics > Install Ryzen Master).  I think this problem might have something to do with a handshake breaking between Ryzen Master and Adrenalin, after upgrading just Adrenalin.   From now on, I'll probably do clean installs, removing and reinstalling both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master, through Adrenalin Performance tab.",Positive
Intel,"My last two processors are ryzen amd, my last three video cards are amd radeon and next one will be amd also, nvidia has driver issues as well, to be honest.  But yes, some issues are too annoying and updating drivers is lottery at this point. I would advice against updating drivers unless you need it for specific new game or have the latest video cards - rx 9070 \[xt\]  or 9060 xt .  I should have sold the 7700 xt and bought 9060 xt 16gb instead but too late for that now and it has problems as well, so lottery as i said, its a risk.",Negative

Intel,lmao chill out dude go touch some grass,Negative
Intel,Could be grounds for lawsuit… That’s funny!,Neutral
Intel,Because of MPO.,Neutral
Intel,yeah same with 25.11.1 25.9.2 works for me,Positive
Intel,"25.10.2 was the previous WHQL, so also yes :P",Positive
Intel,"Huh, seems to be running in DX12 for me, as reported by MSI AB, and FSR4 is working",Neutral
Intel,Which driver version and does it still crashing?,Neutral
Intel,OK I will install it now and test it and get back to you. Give me 10 mins.,Neutral
Intel,Yuppp. It does not work on bf6 but it works on ark survival ascended for me. Seems it might be a bf issue. I saw ppl saying they were getting more fps with this driver in BF6 but I think they didn't realize it's using FSR 3.1 and not 4.,Negative
Intel,I'll work with the engineer from that ticket check if that issue has somehow regressed.,Neutral
Intel,We've not been able to reproduce this internally so far. Can you remind me which GPU (was this a 7900XTX?) + connectivity method you're using?,Neutral
Intel,Try using DDU to uninstall your current drivers and do a clean install of the 25.10.2 combined drivers if you havent already (you can find it here):  https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-25-10-2.html,Neutral
Intel,"Yup just need to say ""No""",Neutral
Intel,"whew thanks, good think i noticed it first before updating. i have 25.10.2 and 25.9.2 here and they both have windows 10 along their filename so i might as well asked.",Positive
Intel,I don't see how it would work on 23.9.1 lol,Negative
Intel,"Did you use DDU to uninstall the drivers and then reinstall using a driver installer from the AMD website? I found this guide yesterday and it was extremely helpful, specifically step 8:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1lnxb8o/ultimate_amd_performance_fix_guide_stop_lag_fps/",Positive
Intel,I did it this morning before the new driver and confirm chipset drivers were untouched,Neutral
Intel,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.  More people use HDMI than what people think and those TVs don’t always have a DP connector at all.,Negative
Intel,"ah, that explains it. Thanks. :)",Positive
Intel,"What if one does not check release notes? V25.10.2 point to different packages, for installing both CPU and GPU you had to download the AutoDetect package (named “minimal install”). Obviously I’m referring to AMD driver download page.",Neutral
Intel,"Okay, as long as they have a workaround for that... I was planning to get a 9060XT, but also keep my 6700XT for lossless scaling frame gen, was worried the branching would affect that..",Neutral
Intel,"What a mess. I have rdna2 and 3 on the same PC, so combined driver is the solution for this? Or auto detect is the only way?",Negative
Intel,"Damn, that's a huge relief to hear. Most of the frustration came from not knowing whether the issue was even acknowledged.   Thanks a lot for the update.",Positive
Intel,What about Noise Suppression not working since 25.9.2?,Negative
Intel,Finally. The last driver without pink artifacting was 25.4.1  It has been 7 months. AMD Matt acknowledged the bug on [the amd forums](https://pcforum.amd.com/s/question/0D5KZ000011WpJJ0A0/pink-square-artifacting-chrome-discord-and-steam) 5 months ago.  Please let it be fixed with the next driver update. So many 7000series users are on the verge of swapping to Nvidia.  https://i.redd.it/ywrg9at3lp1g1.gif,Neutral
Intel,"what about whatever changed post 25.3.1 for multi monitors? Any driver 25.3.1 and older i can run my main at 200hz, my side at 165, and my third at 60 without issue. Any driver newer than 25.3.1 and running my main at 200hz then playing a game will cause the second monitor (165hz) to flicker, glitch, and freak out the entire time, until the game on the main monitor is closed. Dropping to 165 on the main monitor down from 200hz \*fixes\* the issue but, i paid for 200hz and would like to be able to actually use it again.  (7700xt system)",Neutral
Intel,Hell yeah 🙂 amd I appreciate you see the issues Iv been a fan boy for a long time and I know it will be fixed,Positive
Intel,"Hi. Sorry, I thought this was pretty common as I've had this issue with two different systems and 3 AMD GPUs across 2 generations. [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1jayump/chrome_full_screen_freezes_after_switching_to_amd/) [Or here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/3890720/parts-of-screen-freezes-when-using-chrome) Chrome (or other Chromium browsers, I've had this happen with Edge too) in fullscreen, with graphics acceleration enabled.   Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind this only actually matters if one protocol or the other is **actually** limiting bandwidth for the [resolution * FPS] you want to display on your monitor  For instance, DP 1.4 can do ~25Gbits/s, which translates to roughly 1440p @ 240fps, or 4k @ 120fps  If you have proper cable into HDMI 2.1, it should be able to do ~42Gbits/s, which would instead be 4k @ 190fps  Read up the wikipedia tables for bandwidth specs and resolution / fps / bit depth rates for more",Neutral
Intel,Yeah most people are still have dp 1.4 monitors though. No way I'm swapping my monitor just for dp 2.1 as it's just too awesome. Although these tandem OLED screens look interesting... Hmm lol,Positive
Intel,"lol, listened too much to linus  https://youtu.be/g3FkuZNSGkw?t=261",Neutral
Intel,That was my very first actual driver issue I experienced with AMD.,Negative
Intel,Oh that's nice! I'll look into it when I get the chance.,Positive
Intel,Cool. Thank you,Positive
Intel,I might turn on ray tracing in like a medium or low setting just for shits and giggles or screenshots but I don't plan on playing with it on all the time since I'll also play at 1440p so I don't wanna have a really bad experience 😖,Negative
Intel,Exactly! It's insane. I can't believe running through a translation layer is more stable than running native,Positive
Intel,"but i dont know something is also wrong with 25.11.1 ... AMD Adrenalin randomly vanishes from tray     i dont want to roll back to 25.9.1 :-(    but this version was the last which was good so far      maybe when we have luck amd is able to provide next time a ""perfect"" driver without any issues?",Negative
Intel,"Could be it, nothing hardware wise at all and just software too.     Yeah, you're not the 1st I've read that says they have issues on the game.     If you're crashing and the system reboots it does make me think of some stability issues and not really just GPU, but I'm guessing you've already tried stability tests and using the system without OC+A-XMP/EXPO disabled.     Once upon a time I remember reading some people, on other instances and other games, having crashes like that (complete reboot) due to PSU instability as well.     Good luck!",Neutral
Intel,That's strange. My game defaulted to everything maxed out including running ray tracing and I haven't noticed any issues. The game runs incredibly well.  I've got a 5800X3D & 9070XT as well.,Positive
Intel,"Fair enough, and yeah sooner the better for all of us",Positive
Intel,It absolutely could be.  Europe has some pretty good consumer law and promising features that could impact your purchase decision are part of this law.  It can fall under misleading advertisement,Neutral
Intel,"It's not freezing, it's just that the GPU usage is practically at 100% all the time, even with V-Sync enabled. With the 25.9 drivers, this doesn't happen, and the clock speed varies normally, increasing and decreasing as needed when V-Sync is enabled. These 25.10 drivers are causing the GPU to consume more energy unnecessarily.",Neutral
Intel,Fingers crossed,Positive
Intel,"Thanks for attempting to retest.  It's a 7900XTX with an Index connected via DisplayPort. I am on the latest 25.11.1 driver.  I run a monitor at 4k 120Hz 10bpc with HDR Off, which uses DSC, as my main and only display. I tried disabling DSC in the monitor settings which runs at 4k 120Hz 8bpc with HDR Off but I don't think I noticed a change in latency. I thought that DSC on and off on two different devices might contribute to the problem but I'm not sure.   I have also tried running the Index under a RX480 on another PC and I fairly certain the latency looks different under 90Hz and looks similar under 120Hz. Can't play much to test though as an RX480 runs the Index at a very blurry setting. Getting around to doing this test is what took me so long to reply.",Neutral
Intel,Were you able to find the issue?,Neutral
Intel,"Allright ty, will Install new, any differences in performance?",Neutral
Intel,"im running 25.11.1 on win10 7900xt. no problems besides afmf2 breaking the performance overlay, which ive had for multiple updates now",Neutral

Intel,Thank you for this. This was very helpful. Got adrenaline working fine now.,Positive
Intel,"I wish my LG C4 42"" had a display port. Its my primary monitor.",Positive
Intel,"Yep, AMD is not so quick in fixing their driver download page, I still can remember when X870E chipset came out but you found only X670 option.

Intel,Can you tell us what content you have on the secondary panel when it starts misbehaving? Is this behaviour affected if you disable VRR on it too?,Neutral
Intel,"I see. I recall the partial display freeze being related to DWM & multi plane overlay in Windows.

Intel,"They are TV's, not pc monitors. Buy the right tool for the job",Neutral
Intel,"I couldn't find the DWM key so I made one, we'll see if that fixes it. Thank you for replying. But please, forward it to someone. There must be people out there on AMD hardware that are not tech savvy and this just breeds bad reputation.",Neutral

Intel,"Yeah, I'm facing the same issue on RX 9060 XT   Is it a GPU driver issue, or a Windows issue that Microsoft needs to fix?",Negative
Intel,since last BF6 Update i had zero crashes also on 25.11.1,Positive
Intel,"That's not how it works. Small print won't save you from stuff like this, you think that they can stop releasing this software for 2-3 years because some small print said 'Subject to change'?   European consumer law would absolutely support the consumer in this case. If you promise a feature by a certain date, you will need to deliver it.

Intel,"Works in Windows too. But Windows has way too much overhead for all of the AI garbage, ads and integrated spyware running in the background to still be a usable operating system. Linux is much better.   The drivers install all side-by-side, and all GPUs show up as OpenCL devices. In the software you can then select which one to run on.   FluidX3D can select multiple OpenCL devices at once, each holding only one part of the simulation box in its VRAM. So VRAM of the GPUs is pooled together, with communication happening over PCIe.",Neutral

The rendering is done multi-GPU too, as domain decomposition rendering. Each GPU knows only a part of the whole fluid simulation box in VRAM and can't see the others. It only renders its own domain, at 3D offset, to its own frame with accompanying z-buffer, and copies those to CPU over PCIe. The CPU then overlays the frames.",Neutral

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative

The main example that seems to suggest otherwise is actually a demonstration of nVidia's forced threading of DX11 games, which can increase performance despite the increased overhead it entails, when the CPU has enough headroom overall (i.e. it doesn't eat into the single-thread performance).",Negative

Maybe they'll improve it by hooking it up to a wider GDDR bus in laptops, similar to how the current PS5 and Xboxes work (IIRC?)",Neutral
Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks. Intel is already moving on it and I think the main thing holding AMD back is that they rely on 3rd parties for memory packaging so the capacity goes to the more lucrative enterprise chips first.",Neutral

What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra.

AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative

It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs.

Intel,Gotta remember that it's Intel's first line of GPUs. It's going to have issues ofc. Even now they're still improving. And it's only going to keep getting better from here on out,Positive
Intel,"Ok mate, take a first gen product and compare it to a 7th or 8th gen product.  Intel has their issues, anyone buying into them should have known that.",Negative
Intel,"You probably setup VRR wrong, whether that wasnt enabling V-Sync (yes, youre supposed to for VRR), or you tried to use an older HDMI standard, or had a bad driver install and didnt clean install new drivers. Because it absolutely does work as intended with Arc. Arc's VRR is based on VESA's adaptive sync, like Freesync and G-sync compatible also are.  As for A750 performance being worse than a 6800 XT, duh. One card sells for $180, the $450, they are in completely different price and performance tiers. Just like a 7900XTX would make your 6800 XT look like its junk.",Negative

Intel,bruh. This is Intel first generation of discrete GPU. it's damn impressive how fast they are improving. I like AMD too but Intel is doing a pretty good job there,Positive
Intel,I had an arc a750 as a placeholder until I got. A 6950xt and I love it so much. Except amd still hasn't fixed the ghost of tsushima issue other than that it's been phenomenal and I get over 60fps in almost every game at 4k,Positive
Intel,"Well one great thing you have to look forward to is amd is going all in on software. They already said FSR with AI is coming, and I have a feeling a lot more. We should be seeing some pretty cool software features coming out now that they have more employees for software",Positive
Intel,"Actually not. Intel i740, released long time ago was the first discrete GPU from them.",Neutral
Intel,"I'm keeping my eye on Intel gpus, but I certainly won't be a first adopter. Honestly I'll be even more skeptical now with Intel's recent issues with 13/14 gen cpus.

If Intel can be competitive in the budget market it will at least put a fire under amd to lower their prices/make a better valued product.",Negative
Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't. Problems that Nvidia and AMD both solved decades ago that are holding Intel back in 2024.   It's not a mystery how a GPU should be built but that didn't stop Intel from not figuring it out.,Neutral
Intel,"Installs beta software, proceeds to complain about it",Negative
Intel,Doesn't make it less of a fact that users are experiencing issues and they still paid hard cash for those GPUs.,Negative
Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral
Intel,"This was a graphics card, not a ‘GPU’ in terms that we understand them now, just to bolster the point about how much of a disparity this comparison reveals.",Neutral
Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so? They paid full price for a product and it should work as advertised.  With that said, the issues with Arc are widely known and complaining about it after the fact is a bit sillly at this point.",Negative
Intel,If you're playing ghost of tsushima with her enabled it will crash your drivers and you'd have to re-download them via integrated graphics on your cpu,Negative
Intel,"It's not completely irrelevant, as it shows they already had GPU produced before. That GPU had driver issues same as ARC and i believe same will be passed on to BATTLE MAGE.",Neutral
Intel,"Dude, GPU is not same as graphics card. i740 was a GPU in a same way nVidia RTX and AMD RX series are today.

Intel,Graphics Processing Unit.  Maybe you're confused and thinking of GPGPU?,Neutral
Intel,"her?   i cant say i encountered any problems other than launching with FSR activated crashed the game, but it was optimized enough that you dont need FSR at all (also a ps4 game port which helps)",Neutral
Intel,It's irrelevant because it's from so long ago the people who worked on it are likely no longer working at Intel so there's no organizational knowledge to transfer into designing Arc.,Negative
Intel,Not irrelevant though is that Intel has been making iGPU drivers for the last 20+ years with massive marketshare and still don't get it anywhere NEAR right.,Negative

Intel,"I bought an ARC A770 16GB card for experimentation and my experience seems to have been better than computerbase.  I had no problem using it for 3440x1440 without raytracing. I have to reduce some settings in the heaviest games, but then I can hit 60fps in most games without using upscaling.  It makes me wonder if they have used older drivers, since they don;t even get 60fps rasterized at 1080p in some games.  edit: And I paid much less than the minimum price they are listing, I'd need to check if prices went up - even though computer base suggest that isn't the case. The bigger problem still, but getting better, is that when it doesn't work it's really really terrible.",Positive
Intel,"Well I mean... I guess it depends on what you're wanting to do of course, but even my 12 GB card was struggling to do raytracing a couple years ago, so that claim isn't really far fetched.  My 20 GB card struggles to hit 60 fps with path tracing at 1440p",Negative

We've had issues with AMD drivers in a video production house where we ran Vega GPUs under Linux for DaVinci Resolve editing on the desktops and for rendering on the farm.   Those were the worst years of my life where I had to support the investment that failed as soon as the decision to go with AMD was made.   It costed our company the weight of those cards in solid gold.   After years of battling AMD and failing, I made an ultimatum to our ceo and told him directly that I didn't want to support this anymore and that I'd leave if we didn't switch everything to Nvidia and I actually quit the company over this because the response was that it was impossible. 2 months later they sold all the AMD hardware at a fraction of the original price and managed to take a credit to switch everything to NVIDIA.  Somebody else even made a huge post here and on r/linux, phoronix covered it slightly and AMD went into full panic mode, their developer advocate came here and on AMD forums and in emails and made many grand promises. Here we are almost 10 years later, same issues still exist.  Oh yeah, and BlackMagic (DaVinci Resolve maker) today officially doesn't support their software on any AMD hardware. Thousands of editors, graders and admins go on forums and ask about AMD only to just get directed to Nvidia by the BlackMagic staff.  Great job AMD! You don't deserve a single customer...",Negative
Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative
Intel,"Yo, I saw the title and thought this gotta be Gnif2.",Neutral
Intel,"And I'm over here struggling to keep an Nvidia T4 passthrough to work reliably on Hyper-V to Ubuntu 22.04. :(  Is there a specific software combination that works more reliably than others?   Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.  They working with some kind of magic radiation over there?",Negative
Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.  You're free to guess what vendor om looking at to replace my CPU with. Damn shame really.",Negative
Intel,"Fact: AMD does not give a shit about any of this.   We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line. If all CDNA customers switch to NVIDIA and those PO's dropped in volume, it might make them care a little bit.",Negative

Intel,"I’ve been buying ATI / AMD since the ATI Rage 128, and I think my next GPU will be Nvidia. I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

Intel,"[Wish i could play Hell Divers 2 but when i bought it took 30 seconds to get a driver timeout,](https://i.imgur.com/FqM9MRx.mp4) anyway i decided to not switch NVIDIA cos i also well usually play a lot of World of Warcraft but that game has problems for both AMD in form of freezes and driver timeouts gradually getting worse until you update drivers again, cos shader cache gets reset it stops crashing again for couple of days, then starts crashing more frequently and the frequency varies per user and what they doing as well as if their some sort of memory leak.  Also some other games having driver timeouts to, but i have games that also never timeout.  Speaking of which users started reporting flickering issues in browsers such as chrome, or any chrome based browsers, and their 2 reports of it being fixed after MPO is disabled so i guess MPO issues are back on the menu.

I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.  Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical. I guess that's why nobody is already doing it.",Neutral

I think they're the defense of a brand like it they are defending their sports club.  We're stuck between the overpriced that just work, and the nightmare the AMD software overall is. I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?  ""I have had X AMD GPUs, with Y experience in computers, never had a problem!""  Or even better, ""That is because you suck at computers"" said by some NPC that doesn't even know what an OS is..  I really hope your letter gets where it needs to go, and please keep up the good job. I still hope AMD steers in the right direction so it can put Nvidia to shame(I want to believe poster here). Not because I have something against this brand or the other, but because we need competitors, or else you'll end up paying 600$ for a nice system, and 6000$ for the GPU.

My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with?    My own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures.",Neutral

Intel,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",Neutral

Intel,"AMD's reputation on VDI seems to be a dumpster fire in homelab scene despite having the first SR-IOV implementation compared to Nvidia and Intel(yes, even Intel is into VDI market!). Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture. Direct passthrough is also possible without too many hacks like AMD do(*cough* vendor-reset *cough*).  People always consider Intel graphics processors as a laughing stock but you gotta respect them for the accessibility of vGPU solution, directly on integrated graphics that everyone gets. They are even trying to enter VDI market with GPU Flex cards based on Alchemist GPUs(SR-IOV was disabled on discrete ARC consumer cards). Hopefully subscription-free model can make Nvidia a run for its money, at least in entry VDI solutions that Nvidia has no interest in.",Negative

Intel,"It's more that I don't want to reward a business for failing me.  If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU  partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.""  ""I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any  reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU,  VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either. So we can't expect  them to do anything and spend the man hours to deliver fixes and work  with the different projects (QEMU, Redhat, Spice, ...etc).""",Negative
Intel,"I'm the same. my issues with Nvidia drivers were so bad it made my gpu and entire windows install functionally bricks. Got rid of my EVGA 760 when the 900 cards and AMD's 300 series came out, jumped to R9 390 and haven't looked back since (R9 390>RX 5700xt>RX 7700xt) The only issue i ever had with AMD was the first few months of the 5700xt and its awful unplayable performance issues in DX9 games, but that was solved within months, and they eventually went on to improve opengl performance on Navi/RDNA as well which was a nice welcome surprise. Ive had a few hiccups that looked like driver issues that turned out to actually be Windows issues, and i always wonder if people are quick to blame AMD for issues because of what they have heard vs actually investigating and finding the real cause of the problem.

I should have just re-pasted my previous GeForce and ride out the pandemic shortage, but I wanted a faster GPU and thought I'd give a Radeon one final chance. There wasn't a 3080 or 3090 available back then, otherwise I would've rather bought one.   While 6800XT has had some okay drivers here and there, the overall experience remains sub-par; the road still is full of unpaved and rough sections.

Intel,"I get that you are being cheeky, but the use-case is very difference and the professional-demands are far far far higher.  When you run several machines off of a single unit, suddenly there's workloads that has to be completely in due time for things to move ahead.  I just want to contextualize the issue you are making (a tadd) fun of.  So in the basic but common example above, you can't really complete your job because the entire main system has to be shut down. That's like stranding 6 people because the bus broke down. And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.  I think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable. There need to be a proper high-grade (and low grade) reliable way to avoid that.  Just sucks it took this long, and so much effort to get AMD to pay notice to the issue at hand here.

For context - Unity VRAM usage is - Unity allocating ""how much it want"" and in case of two different GPU Unity may allocate less or more in DX-API, or DX-API have some internal behavior for Unity case on Nvidia so it allocating less.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

Intel,"Sorry but AMD ""working with"" is a joke. I have been working with companies that have hundreds to thousands of AMD Instinct GPUs.  I have been able to interact directly with the AMD support engineers they provide access to, and the support is severely lacking. These issues here have been reported on for over 5 years now, and what has AMD done for these clients?  Until I made my prior posts here on r/AMD, AMD were not interested or even awake when it came to these issues. I have had direct correspondence with John Bridgman where he confirmed that GPU reset was not even considered in prior generations.  Of what use are these support contracts and the high cost of buying these cards if AMD wont provide the resources to make them function in a reliable manner.  Why did it take some random (me) to have to publicly embarrass the company before we saw any action on bugs reported by their loyal paying enterprise clients?",Negative

We still are lacking working support for the likes of Nutanix and Proxmox (both KVM), where Redhat has some support but there are still unresolved issues there.  Fact of it, the changes AMD is pushing at AWS would upstream to every other KVM install and bring those fixes to mainstream.

My gaming stability issues were always caused by unstable RAM timings and CPU OC settings - since I upgraded to an AM5 platform with everything stock, I'm solid as a rock. My 7900XTX has been absolutely perfect.  There is an unfair perception in gaming with AMD's drivers where people think they are far worse than they really are - it's a circlejerk at this point.  Your issue is different (and valid), you don't need to conflate the known issues in professional use cases with gaming - it'll just get you pushback because people who use AMD cards for gaming (like me) know the drivers are fine for gaming, which makes you come across as being hyperbolic - and if you're being hyperbolic about the gaming stuff, what else are you being hyperbolic about?

There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).

They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.

When I was playing overwatch or D4 I didn't notice it any worse than one of my gaming laptops(I have a 3070ti and a 5060 laptop. The 3070ti has the hot intel 12k series in it). I also use Intel's ai playground and never thought of a heat issue during this.   Using HWMonitor the temp does spike to 95-97C before fans start to kick in or the voltage down regulates some. I have two devices with the last gen chips, the 258v and 256v. Basically identical beside the RAM. I actually use the 256v system as a ""work daily"" cus of low energy usage. Anyway, these new chips certainly suck more power if they need it and are set to performance mode but that also comes with a lot more performance.   Performance mode does kick the fans up, which would help with dissipating heat. This mode seems to be around 40w max. The balanced mode is about a 30w max and the eco-silent looks to be sub 20w.   A note, I am up north and the ambient room temp is 68F. She does mention being in Arizona in the video, but what is the room temp, do they keep it warm at like 75F for an office?",Neutral

Intel,I want Intel to win but sadly they only win against the HX370 which is a generation behind the 395+. So intel is still behind. They better price it well below the HX370 to regain market share. AMD lost the plot in terms of pricing and HX370 handhelds are well over 1300. If they can partner with MSI and produce a handheld for under 1000 they have a winner.

Intel,"That is my point. Not worth the price if it barely beats the HX370. And just the fact we need to have this conversation shows how Intel Marketing miserably failed. If the B390 devices are cheaper, please make sure you plaster it everywhere and communicate it well. Even the people interested in it like me do not know or believe it.   Again if anyone at intel reads this, you better price this lower than the HX370 or you have no chance. I do not like AMD but sadly they have the best overpriced products right now.",Negative
Intel,this sounds about right.  Intel just said that the margins are PTL are below corporate average. which means yields on 18a are abysmal.  Expect prices to be high and supply to be low until yields improve (which the CFO head said wont be till 2027. But they should gradually improve through 2026.  AMD and intel are in a race. Intel need to improve 18a yields. AMD needs to get zen6 out. Whoever gets there first will be the winner. Until then it kinda looks like the laptop market is just a continuation of what it was before. AMD gets a slight pickup from the 400 series. Intel gets a slight bump from PTL.,Neutral
Intel,well why don't they restock it ??,Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, I wish Intel would give these 'Intel Graphics' model numbers. An Intel Graphics on a N series SKU is going to be far weaker than a B370/B390 masquerading as 'Intel Graphics'.

Intel,Will panther lake pc CPU's have this kinda powerful igpu?,Neutral
Intel,"Have any of the ""regular office worker""-level CPUs been seen yet?  I am hoping we can see 8 to 10 hours of battery life under real usage.  We get 12 to 14 with MacBook Air 13's, so we would like to at least see a full work day with the Intel CPUs.  We were really hoping we would have seen that with Lunar Lake, but we usually see closer to 4 to 7 hours under real usage.",Neutral
Intel,"Stop with these fake benchmarks.  You will see when the benchmarks are not cherry picked, it will be no where near a 4050 lol. They had to gimp the poor 4050 all the way down to 30w, which I don’t even know how it even operates as such low wattages for the b390 to have a chance.  The full wattage 4050 (100w+) is about as fast as a 3060 desktop, this tiny iGPU in real world gaming tests will be at most best case scenario as fast as a full powered 3050, which is still  a massive 50-60% slower than a 4050 laptop.",Negative
Intel,"Because the low end discrete options are non existent or outdated, or bad value. The door is open for anyone to fill in that low end spot.",Negative
Intel,"It has to be cheaper first.  Current pricing of laptops with these chips is looking really high.  Granted they are mostly 'nicer' laptops, but still, really steep.  Check out the XPS pricing for example...",Negative

Intel,"True, but it's probably the ram situation. Unless intel is asking for a lot to recoup the 18A investment... Theoretically the PTL SOCs themselves shouldn't be the pricing issue",Neutral
Intel,"This. If 8060S Halo had been available.. at all, but also.. in sub 1600 laptops, or 8050S in sub 1200, it would have been wonderful. Same is true for PTL with B390 + 9600 MT/s RAM. I hope they will be competitively priced (also, hope the RAM pricing doesn't hit them too bad).",Positive
Intel,There is laptop models priced at $1300 with the iGPU you want.  I don't know what the chip pricing is - we never really do with mobile - but it seems low enough that regular priced laptops can include a high end Panther Lake chip.,Neutral
Intel,"To be fair...they are priced very cheaply. There was a $600 5050 laptop on sale last year even.  Nvidia volume pricing on 50 tier mobile GPUs seems to be very attractive, it's up to manufacturers how much extra they want to tack on but you can build a very cheap, very capable laptop using this GPU.",Positive

Intel,"Exactly, I hate these cherry-picked overhyped tests and claims.   It’s a small iGPU, you can’t possibly expect 4050 and definitely not 5050 discrete level performance lol, and I get downvoted so hard even though I’m right… reddit moment.",Negative
Intel,"If that is true, then we should see some spiking up in costs across the space in which case you'll get a collapse in shipments since relatively few people can afford 2k laptops and I'd guess people are more sensitive to a laptop priced at 1200 vs 1500 compared to something priced 2000 vs 2300 since the most price elastic part of the market is going to just give up before they even get to 2000.",Negative
Intel,They put too much CPU in them to get them cheap. Though my 8060s z13 with 64gb ram was $1650 (open box Best Buy a while back) that was a lucky sale unlikely to happen again. I’d rather have a super thing and light XPs 13 with panther lake though and probably will unload the z13 when I can get the XPs.,Negative

This guy I replied to stating it’s on par with a 65w 5050, is stupid and gullible. At 65w the 5050 laptop loses a few percentage of perf, compared to if it was max 100w+. It is no where close to a 5050, at any wattage, whether the lowest 45w or not. Some people are so gullible.  Like I said the timespy score is inline with a 3050, the 5050 laptop has around 4060 desktop perf for crying out loud. This tiny little iGPU with its low combined package tdp is no where close to a 4050, and especially not even in the same universe as a 5050.

It's not trading blows with the 5050 65W. It's getting creamed by the 4050 60W.

If the dual GPU version was really available for $999 right now (as announced), then Intel would make significant inroads into the local AI market.  As it is, buying this for $800 over a used 3090 is a really hard sell. Compared to a B60, the 3090 is readily available for $1100, and provides the same VRAM, double the compute and memory bandwidth, better perf/watt, and CUDA support.  With the dual GPU cards even at $2k each this does have one single niche - being able to get 144 GB of VRAM in a server at under 1500W for under $10k -  which is legitimately useful for LLM inference.  It's really sad that Intel didn't put in the investment a year ago to have a lot of capacity to produce these now.

Intel,"i'm no expert but i dove in to Wiki      it was a [1GB/s to 3.25GB/s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Link_Interface) interface. For refference PCI-E 2.0 was 1GB/s and 3.0 was 2GB/s BUT per lane so 16 and 32GB/s.  For refference HDMI 1.4 has 10.2Gbit/s  So as i understood it most of the data bandwidth were used for tossing the image output back and forth as only a single card were the one outputting the image (assuming you weren't running tripple monitor widescreen setup on SLI GPU's....) and our image data could more or less saturate the link  someone correct my math if i'm totally bonkers, but 2560x1440p = 3.686 million pixels. each using 24 bit (8-bit color on 3 chanels) which is 88Mbit/s. if you output 60 of those that is 5.3Gbit/s. 1GB/s = 8Gbit/s. Okay okay you wouldn't always throw a full image so lets call it 2.5Gbit. You were still using quite a lot of the bandwidth on the image alone, so from my understanding most of the interface communication was more related to ""who did what"".  and in AFR you would be handing over a full frame.",Neutral

Intel,"This thing is absolutely nuts  AMD BTFO unironically, I'm floored. I never, ever would have considered an Intel chip before 2025, now this is the most obvious laptop part ever.

I really, really wanted a Strix Halo laptop, but the lack of SKUs, price and the inflexibility with RAM kind of make it unappealing to say the least, not to mention the power draw compared to Panther Lake is unwelcome. These laptops are gonna be probably the best x86 in mobile has eaten in a very long time.  On top of that, it's almost making the 5050 look like a stupid part in a laptop.

Intel,"Bingo  Strix is also limited by being RDNA 3.5 and no FSR4, so it's rather dependent on raw throughput, and it can't possibly fit in a comfortable handheld that would last for more than an hour and a half under load.  I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage. I hope they keep it up, it would really be cool to see an AMD vs Intel APU console war generation.",Neutral

Intel,">GPU's will take all the bandwidth you can feed them.   Didn't deny that. But 12 Xe cores is presumably considered the sweet spot, that's all I'm saying. And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.  Besides, Intel already has Nova Lake AX in the backlog, or whatever it's going to be called. Practically intel's strix halo. It'll have Xe3P cores, more powerful than Xe3, thus deemed more worthy of the halo treatment.",Neutral
Intel,"This is a big of exaggeration, as you can see with Nvidia moving to gddr7. While bandwidth has increased substantially, performance is clearly limited by lack of compute power",Negative
Intel,"No official confirmation yet, but JayKihn leaked the tile size for the 12Xe SKU last year. Another user somewhere else said the 4Xe GPU is 33mm2.   https://x.com/jaykihn0/status/1812898063502938260   And even without the PHYs and NPU, from what I see, Halo's GPU tile is still like almost 3 times as big.

It's only 2x the fps (and who knows, panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus, but we'll never know, because Intel won't release a strix halo competitor)",Neutral
Intel,"Halo's die is still quite a bit bigger, but from the Intel side, you need to include IO, GPU and about half of the compute die which has the MCs, encoders / decoders, etc. to match the ""GPU"" die of Halo, so it is more like 200mm² to 300mm² when compared",Neutral
Intel,AMD is paying more attention to NVIDIA for sure. ESP on the data center side.,Neutral
Intel,">much larger Xe3 GPU's exist.  The biggest one for the moment is on Panther Lake X CPUs.

But all I need to know is it's faaar bigger.  >panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus  That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.",Neutral
Intel,"Well Panther uses mixed processes, and hybrid tiles are bound to be a bit less space efficient than putting everything on a single die. And to be fair, Halo GPU uses N4P process while Panther GPU uses N3E So, still not directly comparable.   Gotta say though, Arc's PPA has improved a lot since Alchemist and Battlemage.",Neutral
Intel,"> That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.  Yeah, it doesn't matter how much memory bandwidth you have if the GPU doesn't have the raster performance to keep up with the flow of data. Case and point, AMD's R9 Fury X. Released with 4096bit bus HBM. Had a total memory bandwidth of 512GB/s. Yet the GTX 980 Ti released with a 384bit bus and 336GB/s memory bandwidth and it out performed the Fury X in pretty much everything.   That said, I have no idea how close the iGPU is to being bandwidth bottlenecked at 1080p. But I very much doubt doubling it would also double the frame rate.",Negative

Intel,"I wonder if Valve would be considering Panther Lake for a Steam Deck 2. It sounds like a generational leap from RDNA2 (which is what they were looking for), and can be cheap enough for valve to slightly subsidize the cost.   I guess the main thing is the power envelope. I think Valve is only interested in making handhelds that deal with a 15W TDP or lower",Neutral
Intel,"Series 3 seems like the biggest Intel W in a long while.   Plays AAA games at 45-60fps with upscaling, and all other games at native at 60+.

There's also already laptops listed on sites like Best Buy for reasonable prices (sub $1300). Compare this to the AI 395 from AMD that can't be found for less than $2500 while being significantly less power efficient. Granted, that APU isn't really comparable.",Positive
Intel,"the handhelds with these chips are going to slap. Also people gotta remember that using upscaling on smaller screens especially 7-9 inch screens is a lot more tolerable.  and these benchmarks are of triple A titles, monster hunter wilds is a dogshit unoptimized game, and people will be playing a mixture of game from older titles, indies, emulation etc.",Positive

Intel,Do you think there's any particular reason why they would want to go with ARM? Quite sure Intel proved here that efficiency is essentially equal between both ARM and x86 here,Neutral
Intel,It's hilarious to think Steam would work with Qualcomm.,Neutral
Intel,"Very unlikely. Proton and DXVK work alright with x86 but adding ARM conversion on top is, uh, a **very** poor experience. In fact that first generation of Snapdragon laptops had among the highest return rate of laptops I have ever seen. Amazon [literally warns potential customers](https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/snapdragon-x-powered-surface-laptop-7-gets-frequently-returned-item-warning-on-amazon) about it.  Valve definitely wants a wider adoption rate of SteamOS and ditching x86 is not going to help that. They are **not** Nintendo that can ask devs to target their architecture. It's going well so far because for most games you can just make a standard Windows version, slap Proton and it works within 10% of native performance under optimal circumstances. Anything that can increase incompatibility rate (and it VERY well can, ARM **does not** support AVX2 natively for instance meaning [a lot of games that might have issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/1dekmtz/avx2_game_list/) even starting or underperform).",Negative

Intel,Yep AMD ces presentation dry as a bone until that rack announcement when ceo turned giddy.,Neutral
Intel,"Even more efficiency that doesn't exist yet. Snapdragon elite can do some heavy workloads for several hours at a time, but it's not powerful enough for heavy gaming. Valve says they know what they want, it's just not ready yet. I think as great as Panther Lake benchmarks are, the biggest complaint of the Steam Deck is still the 2ish hours of battery life in more demanding titles.  With the existence of other handhelds already, I don't think Valve is trying to aim for the beefier spec department here, if it means the same battery life.",Negative

Intel,"It's not exactly weird. They went PPC before Intel because powerpc was more effective for workloads most people used macs for. The switch to Intel was just because Intel had node leadership and performance leadership. Instead stick to A-chips for low power mobile where intel gave up on servicing. Intel loses node leadership to TSMC for a long time, Apple moves on to everything in-house is a pretty logical progression.  Apple having bespoke solutions isn't new either. they've been doing it since their G workstation days. Their current situation is pretty much on brand for apple, but the difference is the huge mistakes intel made (particularly firing so many top engineers) that led to staff fleeing to other companies, including leadership at Apple processor design.  basically apple did their own thing as usual and did a great job don't get me wrong, not taking anything away from apple. the biggest difference however was intel's CEO and board destroying the company.",Neutral

That said, I’m pretty skeptical about how realistic that is. **With the recent RAM shortages and rising memory costs**, pricing a new card competitively while still keeping margins doesn’t sound easy at all. Memory is a huge part of the BOM, and we’ve already seen how shortages can push prices up across the board.

Intel,"u/I_like_carsyay  XPS 15 9530 hardware does support Resizable BAR, which is why Intel's system detection shows it as available for both your Arc A370M and Iris Xe graphics.

This approach ensures optimal system performance while reducing complexity for users. I recommend checking for the latest BIOS updates from your OEM's support site and contacting their technical support team, as they would have the most current information about how ReBAR is implemented on your specific model and whether any additional configuration steps are needed to fully utilize this feature.

Intel,"Late to this, but I'm a 13900K owner. I have not had any issues with stability since applying the BIOS update and haven't noticed any performance loss, so I think this is fine. I did not thoroughly benchmark before and after though, partially because of how high peak temperatures were before the update. I am using a Noctua NH-D15 and a contact frame to reduce CPU temperatures.  Up until a few days ago I would have said that thread scheduling isn't an issue, but then I played the game Maneater and it's basically unplayable unless you use launch options to force the game to only P-cores. There's the Intel ""Application Optimizer (APO)"" utility but it seems abandoned and you can't add your own games if Intel hasn't added a profile. I was a big proponent of E-cores but honestly it seems like a half-baked technology that Intel never put the effort in to support properly.

AMD,"The 5800X3D came out in April 2022. From that moment on, the gamer and enthusiast answer to ""what CPU should I buy?"" has been a Ryzen. But even outside of the enthusiast space, Intel's competition for the last couple generations has been underwhelming. The 13th and 14th gen used way too much power, before the stability problems began, and Core Ultra is ""ok"" but didn't raise the bar.  This has allowed AMD to charge higher prices than they've been able to for a long time, increasing revenue which is what this article is really about.  Intel's Panther Lake seems to be... good? At the very least its integrated graphics are good. The desktop version is rumored to have a high cache option to finally compete with the X3D.  So that's good, both major x86 CPU makers may have nice competitive products in 2026 just in time for the rest of the computer to be unaffordable.",Neutral

AMD has 1 socket with 2 gens and 3rd incoming. So you could have brought a motherboard in 2022 (B650) and still enjoy the latest gen from AMD).

That said though this means bad for newer gen of Intel CPUs, the newer ones with rebranding that i can't even remember to type here, that is how forgettable they are, were so bad... That when i looked for upgrading from my 12600K, i came from AMD Ryzen before that, i simply decided to go back to AMD AM4 this time around where i used my old B450 motherboard and slotted a 5700X3D there and rode on that for at least a year, then eventually upgraded to AM5 when DDR5 Ram and motherboard prices were dirt cheap and now i am on a 7800X3D.  For me to be enticed once again to comeback to Intel, they need to offer an equivalent to 3D-V Cache for gaming performance while featuring significantly multi core workload performance than what Ryzen currently offers, that is what convinced me when i jumped from my previous Ryzen 5 3600 to an i5 12600K which was noticeably faster while giving me significantly more multicore performance compared to if i would have just upgraded to then $300 5600X which i felt is too expensive for what it offered back on launch.",Neutral

And the thing with platforms is that you're trading better ports and such now for being locked out of future gens. With AMD you still get decent specs but it's gonna get supported a lot longer.  This isn't anywhere near what Ryzens initial situation was.",Neutral
AMD,"245kf is a decent CPU and so is the 14600k. They are about equal to a little bit better than a 7600X or 9600X in gaming. The problem is that Intel chipsets comparable to B650 or B850 are extremely, outrageously expensive and provide no upgrade path. Hence it makes more sense to go AM5 if you like DIY. I don't care if you don't actually overclock or upgrade the CPU. Intel non-OC chipsets are still more expensive than AMD OC chipsets and buyers clearly like having the option of OC/dropping in a new CPU even if they never actually do it.  This may change with Nova Lake/LGA 1951, since Zx70 boards are coming back and the socket will allegedly support four generations of CPUs. But as of right now it's really hard to justify any Intel CPU if you build your own PC, even if the price/performance of the CPU itself is slightly better.",Neutral
AMD,"If Intel actually kept their platforms around for longer than 1 or even 2 years, they might have been able to maintain some stickiness with DIY customers.",Neutral
AMD,"yeah, for the same price your room can be 2-3 degrees warmer because intel never figured out how to improve performance without cranking the shit out of the power usage, and on top of that if you were unlucky enough to buy a 13th or 14th gen cpu you can expect it to just shit itself randomly. intel is a failed engineering company that deserves to be utterly shit on for the chokehold they had on the desktop market in the 2000s and 2010s and the stagnation consumers suffered from during that time, let alone all their failures to keep up with amd post ryzen.",Negative
AMD,It is. But its the best we got. And post name change intel chips are deep down the gutter levels of bad sales,Negative

AMD,"If it weren't for the degradation issues, 13th gen should have been considered decent IMO.",Neutral
AMD,"How would that shrink desktop CPU market share? the memory and storage shortage impacts all markets, not just desktops.",Negative
AMD,"Firstly, this is wrong. Most people can absolutely afford to buy or build a new computer even with the increased prices. Secondly, GPU prices have not shot to the moon. Thirdly, the memory/storage shortage is affecting all markets, so market share would not be impacted.",Negative
AMD,Usually replacing the wifi card is no harder than replacing RAM or a hard drive.  Bigger issue is dealing with the BIOS whitelists many laptops vendors have.  Find that out first before trying to upgrade anything Intel or AMD.,Neutral
AMD,"I mean, their trusted reviewer HUB, talked about how it's better to go 7600X and upgrade later, than buy 12600K that was much cheaper than 7600X at that time.",Neutral
AMD,they will probably go to 1460x and wont make any use of multigen sockets either. Most people dont upgrade frequently and never upgrade in same socket.,Negative
AMD,"Technically server vs workstation is just a label, and both chips can do either",Neutral
AMD,Server class chips are hugely profitable.  Intel makes faaaaaar more money on mobile than desktop. If only AMD could capitalize on a mobile chip with a yearly release cadence that made sense (100mhz increase is nothing). Intel at least was willing to throw more cores at the problem while skylake cores were aging.,Positive
AMD,Ryzen 5 and 7 has been stuck at 6 and 8 core respectively for 8 years straight with any higher core count sold at an upsell and some of you continue to live in 2017.,Negative

AMD,"Of course, 2700X came with a fan, that used to be pushed as a reason why AMD CPUs were better than even discounted Intel looking at forum debates of back then",Positive
AMD,Not too shabby for people who aren't old enough to remember when Moores Law was in full effect and performance per dollar was increasing exponentially.,Neutral
AMD,Not to mention the increase in power consumption going to Intel.  Arrow Lake however did take this to the proper direction of increasing performance per watt. So I'll give credit where credit is due. But AMD still has the performance per watt clinched fairly well. However it is changing.,Neutral
AMD,Current Intel CPUs outperform Ryzen CPUs in power efficiency,Neutral
AMD,that belongs in a museum!,Negative
AMD,Doesn't justify the 80:20 split non X3D zen is getting,Negative
AMD,"Because individual consumers are seeing the largest price increases, and the largest encroachments on their ability to pay those price increases.",Negative
AMD,"Well some newer wifi adapters only work on intel or amd.  They have support in the CPU or chipset for it.  They aren't m.2 cards universally anymore.    Mediatek doesn't support my OS so that's a deal breaker.  On older laptops, I've replaced m.2 wifi cards multiple times.

AMD,"They can but epyc versions tend to cost more and don’t provide a benefit versus consumer ryzen.   (I’m running a ryzen 5700x, intel 245k, opertron, and a few Xeon servers in my basement)",Negative
AMD,AMD can only get so many wafers from TSMC.  And a good but low power mobile chip would probably have to be a very different product from either desktop or server which would complicate things a lot for them.  As is any of the lower binned dies are easily put into desktop instead of server parts.  That wouldn't be true with a dedicated mobile only die.     Probably why they keep sticking with monolithic APU dies for laptop which is a middling solution at best for power management.,Negative
AMD,Are you all there?  Ryzen 9 is still a consumer sku. You're argument literally doesn't make sense,Negative
AMD,"Moore's law has been dead for a while. It was in full effect on the early stages of CPUs becoming mainstream and up to the mid 2010s. Unfortunately, that's the time Intel was a monopoly.",Negative

AMD,So do you Dr. Jones. (Sorry couldn’t resist),Positive
AMD,People really like mobo upgrade paths.  Especially right now if it lets them keep using their same RAM too.,Positive
AMD,"Sure but its not hard to figure out what will work with what.    Yes the whitelists are the problem, like I said before, not the process of changing out the wifi card.    But that isn't Intel or AMD's fault.  That is the laptop OEM's fault.  Doesn't matter what processor you buy.  Only careful checking on what the OEM allows before you buy can save you there.",Negative
AMD,They can use proper buffered ecc memory,Neutral
AMD,Which was a new price tier released in 2019 and also has had the exact same core count 6 years later?   Your original goalpost was “6 years”. There you have it.,Negative
AMD,I mean no AMD had the best processor for several years in there.,Neutral
AMD,You know that X3D chips fail a lot?,Negative
AMD,"AMD systems typically ship with Mediatek garbage now.  Intel has historically pushed their wifi for certain branding.   Again, it's a chipset thing now with wifi 7.  It's not a problem before wifi 6 at all aside from white listing.  As far as I know, lenovo and hp mostly did that.    On desktops, some motherboard vendors are now hiding the m.2 wifi cards under heatsinks to discourage replacing them.  I've seen pictures of a few that were soldered just like the RAM :(",Neutral
AMD,They support unbuffered ecc but you can do that with other amd cpus too,Neutral
AMD,Nope. Bought my 5900x 6 years ago and it was like $100 more than 5800x. Really no big deal.   You got shares in Intel or something?,Positive
AMD,Depends on when you consider mainstream ig.,Neutral
AMD,have not seen any widespread issues ala the 13 and 14th gen shitshow,Negative
AMD,"Its not a chipset thing its a whitelisting thing from the laptop OEM.  The chipset is not what is banning you from installing other wifi cards.  Laptop OEMs were whitelisting hardware on their laptops for years before even wifi5 came out.  Hell it was thing even the 90's!  It has nothing to do with wifi7 or AMD or Intel.  Its all about cutting support costs and forcing customers to buy new laptops by limiting upgrade possibilities.  For desktop it doesn't matter that the ""integrated"" wifi is just a soldered down m.2 wifi.  The PCIe slots are right there.",Negative
AMD,"good luck getting proper ECC working on AMD consumer, with operating system level error reporting",Negative
AMD,"…so the tier itself still got no generational core count increase yet, right?   That’s the original goalpost.",Neutral
AMD,you defined timeframe as up to mid 2010s and in that timeframe AMD did have good CPUs.,Positive
AMD,"both 7800x3d and 9800x3d had widespread burning issues reported, you just werent looking. Even AMD techfluencers talked about it.",Negative
AMD,Because no one talks about it.,Negative
AMD,I have a system with it now. Depends on motherboard support,Neutral
AMD,"if it was so widespread it would be talked about, do you think there’s some sort of conspiracy wrt the hardware community at large to keep x3d failure rates hidden and intel’s amplified?",Neutral
AMD,"As a 6950 XT owner this is VERY annoying. I'd rather not have to mess with my drivers just to get FSR4 working modded in... but AMD just wants to leave anything pre RX 9000 behind, even their brand new RDNA 3.5 iGPUs it seems. I've done the driver mod on my 6950 XT before in Cyberpunk and while FSR4 is a little more heavy than XeSS, it also looks a decent lot better. Then XeSS is much heavier than FSR3.1 anyway so like, it just makes sense to go with FSR4. AMD needs to release it, no question.",Negative
AMD,Amd dug their own grave with FSR  First it was you dont need upscaling. Then they pretend a sharpening filter was good with fsr1. How open source and working on multiple vendors is good. Then they said you don't need AI to do good upscaling with fsr2. Then they said you don't need dedicated hardware for FSR3 (frame generation).  Every single time they kept digging a bigger hole. All this time people got locked into the Nvidia ecosystem with Dlss.  And now AMD have a hardware locked ai based upscaling and frame generation.,Negative
AMD,"Put pressure on them, it's the only way to get them to change their shitty decisions.",Negative
AMD,"The real travesty is AMD gaslighting  buyers into thinking RT and AI upscaling were fads, only to finally imitate Turing 5 years too late, and to then blame the fans for listening to them.",Negative
AMD,AMD really screwed over anyone pre 9xxx series. Crap upscaling really makes games look so much worse.,Negative
AMD,Why bother with marketing and image when you are already at capacity with your sales and you probably plan to reduce supply in the near future?,Negative
AMD,"Glad they're keeping the pressure on her another dumb AMD decision, but they missed a key point which makes AMD's stance even worse - they are still releasing rDNA 3.5 graphics cards in their APUs. Those same products which are in most need of FSR for gaming.",Negative
AMD,Aw man turns out AMD is a corporation after all.,Neutral
AMD,"This is the same company that said that it was ""impossible"" to put a 5000 series ryzen on a B350 motherboard. Lo and behold.",Negative
AMD,Yeah we really know at this point it's getting tiresome and ppl can already use it with mods anyway. I mean it's not even like RDNA4 is that much better off most games need Optiscaler just for basic FSR4 support so what does it even matter? AMD always relied on the open source community and they already said FSR4 will most likely go open source soon as well.  Seriously company's are not your friends and both Nvidia and AMD are just looking in to making a quick bug with AI atm so dunno what ppl are even expecting.,Negative
AMD,Moved from 7900XTX to a 5090 because of this and many other reasons like games not supporting AMD feature.  But what pissed me the most is how bad the frame gen from AMD is to my eyes,Negative
AMD,I wouldn't be even fine with an experimental version. Needs to be full,Negative
AMD,"The difference in tone and style between when Nvidia does something and AMD is hilarious. Cant take them seriously anymore since the RTX 5000 and AMD 9000 series launch and their obvious bias and borderline misleading coverage when it come to the ""fake msrp"" saga",Negative

AMD,"It's pretty bad that my first thought was ""which one?""",Negative
AMD,"As a 6700 XT user, I honestly do not care yet. Do not get me wrong, I am glad big YouTubers are turning up the heat and keeping AMD honest. But my OptiScalar test 2 to 3 months ago was disappointing. FSR 3 Quality was performing close to, or even better than, FSR 4 int8 Performance. quality difference was not worth it  At this point, I would only care about FSR 4 on RDNA2 if AMD can squeeze out an extra 10 to 20 percent. I am not even sure that is a realistic expectation anymore.",Negative

AMD,"Don't forget that the transformer model (4 and 4.5) was even released on the 20 series.  Which supposed to lack that kind of HW performance to do them right, they just said hey, this isn't the best on them and you may need to tweak settings to get the best things out of it, and that if you wished 3.x can still be used just toggle it. And that 4.5 will have more perf issues.  I cannot imagine why AMD won't do the same, like seriously what is going on there, esp if they gave them the extra vram to make them last longer supposedly and now drop them on features that could actually help them last longer.",Negative
AMD,"RDNA4 1, 2, and 3 owners are just going to have to accept that you bought in at the time that AMD had its head in the sand about hardware for RT and ML upscaling. The cards can't do it because they don't have the hardware, and the cards don't have the hardware because AMD didn't take it seriously on the consumer side. The only options for RDNA2 would be to take a big performance hit to the point where it might not even be worth turning it on, or accept an image quality hit to the point where it might not be worth modifying the model when FSR3.1 exists.",Negative

AMD,It's Ok When AMD Does It^TM,Positive
AMD,"consumers are partly to blame imo, all that hate for dlss came back to bite everyone in the ass. literally everyone in the past few years have been saying they don't need/want upscalers/frame gen until amd makes a subpar equivalent and then everyone praises it like it's the second coming of christ when it's not even close most of the time, it's like they don't want to admit that these features are actually really helpful just because it's made by nvidia.",Negative
AMD,"Yep. When your *only* selling point it was available to everyone is gone, their isn't any point for devs to implement as lowest denominator. That will be Intel now.",Negative

AMD,"This, people yelling at GN for putting pressure on nvidia please see the upper comment too",Neutral
AMD,"My annoyance is that their technology gets used in consoles, thus dictating how games and engines are developed.

AMD,"Reminds me a bit of WAAAY back. When shaders first appeared and how 3dfx went under. Yes, novel tech is first slower or inferior than a mature legacy system.",Neutral
AMD,Its a rope pull game of nvidia trying to justify early adoption selling of RT in Bf5 demo days which fell flat and needed more time in the oven and AMD justifiedly being late to the party on features people demand and mocked they dont care about RT. And a huge gray zone where people draw their own lines.  Because anyone with sense knew path traced rendering will be the future. But if its 5 years or 15 nobody knows for sure thanks to moores law,Negative

AMD,they are the wrong direction (RT and ML fuzz) imo but amd software was so fucking bad before this and now its even segmented so you have even more reasons to just go nvidia,Negative
AMD,"It was a fad. It was something that should have been sold to developers, not to consumers. There's a video out there, that people find non-raytraced water nicer to look at because that's what people got used to. Not only they were selling something that didn't look good to the consumer, they did so at a significant price step up and degrading performance. That is the sin of Nvidia. If Nvidia instead gave it for free and only started charging money once it was good, nobody would have complained.  AMD on the other hand, was caught with their pants down because they don't speak to developers as often as they should. They should be begging developers to tell them what tools they think could be good and copying Nvidia's homework on their spare time.",Negative
AMD,"They are imitating the RTX 4000 series. RDNA 2 was AMD's Turing in terms of ML tasks.

PS5 Pro gets PSSR2, then Steam Machine FSR4 INT8 or Full FP8 or something else (custom model based off FSR4). By then people will be so pissed that AMD is forced to release it.  AMD needs a public flogging before they do anything. Pressure on them is nowhere near high enough. GN, LTT and many others need to call them out before anything happens.",Negative
AMD,"Well Tim (in the video) did a comparison between FPS scaling vs image quality and IIRC he prefered FSR4 INT8 Performance vs FSR 3.1 Quality, and the INT8 version performed better at like for like image quality.   Technically if the Game has FSR3, AMD Adrenaline can override similar to GeForce App .dll swapping. So optiscaler isn't as required if the game is relatively recent and already has FSR3.   I'd rather we keep talking about it, but if Nvidia is going to divert GPUs/Memory to AI. AMD can keep focusing on improving FSR Redstone and their 16GB RDNA4 will keep selling above MSRP.",Neutral

Like 4ms or so isn't a killer of viability, for 60fps or lower it's actually still realistic to get going and beats trashing image quality with FSR3.  Like FSR3.1 vs 4 INT8 is night and day, and what I want out of FSR4 is pretty simple... keep my 4K monitor viable with my 6950XT without either integer scaling 1080p or having to resort to FSR3 which is not great, neither is native 1440p on a 4K panel a good idea.",Positive

AMD,"To be fair, AMD's strategy is because they're used in consoles. Every technical decision they've made has been dictated by the cost constraints of developing console hardware. What you get in the desktop was paid for by the console manufacturers and it is as powerful and feature-packed as the console manufacturers were willing to pay.   What I mean is, AMD's strategy with RT was meant to be cheap because it's the way Sony and MS got to have the tech while also not having spiraling hardware costs. Rdna2 is basically the tech those consoles got scaled up and rDNA 3 was rdna 2+.   Rdna4 was basically a rehash of what Sony paid for the ps5 pro. And rdna5 is likely going to be a beef up version of whatever the console manufacturers pay for the 2027 season.    AMD doesn't have anywhere near the r&d money nvidia has and it doesn't have the deep pockets Intel has to throw money to a hard problem until they crack it.   I'm going to be the first to complain about their lack of software strategy, but their hardware strategy makes sense when you consider they get a tenth of the market share nvidia gets and for the longest time had revenue much smaller than Intel's and Nvidia's. They make the best use of the tech MS and Sony pay for their consoles.    Maybe this time they will use that sweet sweet AI money to flesh out their hardware, but I'm not holding my breath. It's clear they have a hard time convincing buyers to give them a try.",Neutral

AMD,ATI/AMD was in the lead pushing for new memory tech on GPUs for like a decade.

AMD,1440p quality DLSS is a slight downgrade for better FPS. It’s worth it every time.,Positive
AMD,"Native is not a magic resolution where everything is correct. This is a statement people keep making that sounds correct if you don't think about it, but it's just flatly wrong.      Tons of geometry and textures have detail that can be smaller than a pixel in games today. The vast majority of effects and basically all the lighting (whether ray traced or not) is initially rendered at lower than native resolution.  TAA is already used in basically every game because of how common deferred rendering is. If TAA weren't used, the flickering and aliasing would be so intense it would make games unplayably bad.    Even if none of that were true, the idea of native being ""correct"" makes no sense. We would have had no need then for antialiasing techniques like SSAA or MSAA.    DLSS and all upscaling techniques today are a form of super sampling. It's just that they trade off spatial resolution and do the super sampling temporally. Using data from past frames is obviously worse than just rendering at a higher resolution in a vacuum. But you need cheap anti aliasing that covers everything anyway. And basically every game needs temporal accumulation (to run effects at sub-native resolution) in order to run fast enough with good enough visual quality anyway. And if you really can create an algorithm that effectively reuses data from past frames, then it can both look better and run faster than native.    Now could there be edge cases where something looks worse? Sure. All you need to do is look at FSR2/3 to see how worse algorithms make a ton more tradeoffs. But with good techniques, there will also be many situations where it can look better.    And if you truly care about quality above all else, then you can turn up graphical settings when introducing some upscaling. You'd have to compare something like ""Native"" with Low settings to DLSS with Medium or High settings (turning up the most impactful graphical settings until the framerate was the same).    Personally, at 4K output,  DLSS is always worth turning on. Your dumb PC gamer gatekeeping is hilarious because PC has by far the best upscaling and the most ways to tweak it.",Negative

AMD,"In 2020, during the RTX 3000 series launch, Nvidia tried to control HU's videos because HU ""did not focus enough"" on DLSS. I believe it was either by refusing to send FE cards, or directly by telling them what to write? Not sure anymore, but after a public outcry and support from LTT, GN, and other outlets, Nvidia reversed their course.  Nonetheless: HU did not take this story well. They were previously indeed focusing on rasterized performance. After this Nvidia stunt, they continued to do that, and it took them until about ~2022/2023 when they finally started properly and broadly testing FSR/DLSS - after it became evident that a) there's enough games that support it and b) there is a demand for coverage from the pubic, because gamers are actually using it.  Even still, a lot of their FSR vs DLSS comparisons did acknowledge that DLSS was better, but the wording was always casting AMD in a better, or at least a good, light. Either FSR wasn't far behind DLSS, or the price differences on GPUs made AMD a better purchase, or whatever other reason they could find, but they had a very clear pro-AMD bias.  Only around the Radeon RX 9000 series release did HU balance their coverage. I believe this was because both companies, AMD and Nvidia, had done so much anti-consumer shit by that point, that the public hated them (almost) equally.  Before this launch, the Reddit majority opinion was ""AMD has shittier drivers, but GPUs are much better value, and we can handle worse FSR for the price difference, also they are much better for Linux and fuck Nvidia for many valid reasons"". After the launch, Nvidia invested into Linux drivers (but had Windows driver issues of their own), AMD did the same shit with pricing, and DLSS pulled away far enough from FSR that the difference became too difficult to ignore. Both companies now have done so much anti-consumer shit in one way or another that they are evenly disliked, imo.",Neutral

If amd follow the hate blindly then they'll just be left behind at this point just like how they didn't believe at dlss at first and so did many people including reviewers.

Setting aside AMD's humble beginnings as a ""second source"" manufacturer of Intel's designs in the 1980s and their eternal game of catch-up in the 1990s after Intel discontinued second sourcing of their designs starting with the 486, they were completely noncompetitive between late 2006 and the advent of Zen 1 in 2017 due to their ""Phenom"" and ""Bulldozer"" architectures lagging far behind Intel's ""Core"" CPUs.    Note that even when Ryzen launched it still took three generations just to reach technological parity in 2019-20 versus Intel's then-current offerings (i.e. Ryzen 3000-series / ""Zen 2"" vs Core 10000-series / ""Comet Lake"") as well, so honestly it's *only* been 5+ years of AMD being in the lead so far this time around.",Positive

AMD,Well am not gonna write you elaborate 😅 so I will try to explain what I ment by gains in simple words! 😏   Look when I said about latency test in PYPrime 2b this test measures how fast Memory exchange data with CPU so theoretically faster ram 6400+ should give you faster data transfer but unfortunately UDIMM's with higher clocks are losing timings and while you do that you're latency growing so as example I use standard EXPO 6000c30/38/38/96 and in AIDA Latency test it get 75.3ns and after all my tuning on my old R7 7700 I get 57.6ns almost 20ns fastery Ram exchanged data with CPU and because of this I get uplift in games especially in 1% Low but Biggest gains I felt and feel is in System Responsiveness like apps like browser file explorer and other apps like these started opening immediately! You click and app is open and ready to go + feeling of mouse how smooth suddenly become! Even likes of Steam opening visible quicker!    But having 9800x3D gives you uplift because of extra 64mb cache and this cache too exchanging data with memory so when your extra cache can exchange data faster you get more performance all for free!!   So if you have any more questions and I can try to answer you 😏,Neutral
AMD,No i understand. I believe everything is explained in the description of the project on github much better than i could explain it.,Positive
AMD,"Gotcha, ultimately you do you.  If you are programming though, I do recommend getting AIDA64, just plug in one of the codes you find on Reddit and give it an hour long spin while you eat or something.  Most instabilities are found within seconds to minutes, so it's pretty fast.  Don't want any errors with your programming work that is caused by unstable hardware, so I'll recommend giving it a try when you feel like it one day, though again, plenty of people just live with it.",Positive
AMD,"Running it too far in the edge daily is dumb, because CPUs degrade over time.    It can run well today, but in a week or in a year, especially after updates, it might not run stable anymore. Such errors are hard to detect, if it happens.   It might also degrade faster when running it on the edge.",Negative
AMD,Interesting because before 9800x3D I was suing 7700 which  seems Golden One because I was able to set +200mhz + FCLK 2200 + CO -30 All Cores Per Core and it took it as a champ but if I set even single core at CO -31 IMC aka Memory Controller inside CPU stared to crash even I could set like -125! System was booting I was able to pass some testes but IMC no no! And with this settings +200 CO -30 at stock 90W 7700 beat 7700x 140W in CB r26 scoring 4885pts and hitting 5hgz all cores!  But real gains I seen when set negative offset on CPU -0.500mv on the top of CO -30! Right away my 7700 dropped idle power draw from 34W-36W to 25W-26W exactly like 9700x-9800x3D and when I unlocked it to 170W it score 5063pts in CB r26 and all cores boost was 5.5ghz!      So my conclusion is does your IMC work or scram errors!?,Positive
AMD,My monitor is 200hz 1449 but I have it capped at 144 for similar reasons. I usually use DLAA which limits max FPS for me   I am waiting for the summers to really hit (it gets up to 45C at times here) to kinda do a second pass at all the settings balancing power and heat,Neutral
AMD,"Im using my PC like 6 hours a week. I really dont care about degradation. If it fails in like 4 years, I\`ll buy a new one",Neutral
AMD,You know that playing with DLAA you use full power and DLSS reduce power draw about +-30W but as we can see 50 series undervolt and OC better so as long you happy and all works than who cares 🤷🏻‍♀️😎✌️👉,Positive
AMD,It's more efficient to do this for smaller igpus. Any rt upgrades from rdna4 is wasted area because none of these will run rt at any acceptable perf in real use. You'd rather cut the area for lower cost or increase the wgp count and even with those igpus are still bottlenecked by bandwidth at ~16 cu which covers most consumer segments  Benchmarks ain't gonna like this but it's probably the right thing to do for real use. Consumer markets are goin to shit due to ram prices so enterprise mobile that can withstand the ram shortage better with greater margins and less gaming focus is where shares are gonna be gained  In the end the top igpu pantherlake turned out to be a benchmark pleaser for gamers but not practical for the current market. The rampocalypse that shifts market momentum away from premium gaming to cost focused and enterprise systems is gonna be a coincidental boon for amd's mobile sales.,Neutral
AMD,"Makes sense, RDNA 4 was designed to only scale down to 32CUs. Backporting some of the key features to RDNA 3.5 is probably easier than redesigning RDNA 4.",Neutral
AMD,> none of these will run rt at any acceptable perf in real use  There are lower RT loads like Lumite's optional use of hardware RT.,Negative
AMD,"It's a common misunderstanding in ""enthusiast"" forums - that the ""Later Generation"" is just *better* at everything in every way.  For example, if you cut down a zen4 to hit a lower power and area target, at a known acceptable loss of peak performance, it'll probably look a *lot* like a tweaked zen3. So why not just tweak the zen3?  Not every design decision that went into making RDNA4 from RDNA3 likely makes sense for smaller form factors, power and performance targets, or even different environments (like different vram/bandwidth ratios). It may be that backporting the things that *do* make sense is simpler than cutting half of what you just added out of the design again.",Neutral
AMD,"yeah while i want the day where apu have good RT performance to be here, it aint anywhere close. giving die area for ML stuff for upscaling and raster for the rest of the games while still having somewhat usable RT for optimized games like TDA is the mission atm",Negative
AMD,"Saves validation time. Frankly, these fuckers exist, for the most part, in case your GPU died or you need to install the drivers for it, so work to validate advanced features is a waste of effort.",Negative
AMD,>RDNA 4 was designed to only scale down to 32CUs.  Where did you learn this?,Neutral
AMD,The ISA has nothing to do with hardware designs.,Neutral
AMD,"Not to mention, better to save that time to finish UDNA one and then do a new iGPU arch once that's working.",Positive
AMD,"But why would ya turn that on over higher base presets or a more consistent locked fps at 60? Someone running a midrange igpu would be targeting 1080p 60 raster, not 1080p 40 with rt on. The focus would be on upscaling support and raster capabilities, rt is a distant afterthought  And that's gaming. For enterprise laptops rt capabilities have almost 0 use, it's 99% wasted area. We know that both intel and amd are moving supplies to dc and enterprise. Both lip bu tan and lisa su said so in their most recent earnings call. Amd downplayed the impact of ram prices and said they were focusing on enterprise, intel blamed the consumer market and said they regretted supplying it and are shifting as much as they can to other markets  The story of the next 2years in consumer is kinda ""you're in luck if you can even afford midrange stuff"", forget about premium experiences that push the envelope. Was this really planned by amd? Probably not, they probably cut most rdna4 products to focus on a larger architectural reset with rdna5 and have a gap between rdna3.5 and rdna5 but they lucked out here because of the market conditions.",Neutral
AMD,I game on my laptop Strix Point regularly without a dGPU. For eSports games it's not bad at all.,Positive
AMD,"I think they looked at NAVI44 that has 32CUs and decided there's no lower end chip, because arch doesn't scale well below that?",Neutral
AMD,> The ISA has nothing to do with hardware designs.   It never ceases to amaze me how people will state things with complete confidence while being totally wrong.,Negative
AMD,"Not what they're saying though. First commenter is saying that for AMD it's cheaper to transform preexisting RDNA3.5 igpus into some sort of RDNA 4 lite with FSR4 support, compared to designing a 4WGP RDNA4/5 igpu from scratch while minimizing area usage.  No idea if that's true (the part about not scaling down below 32CUs is definitely sus) but doesn't sound crazy",Neutral
AMD,You should look into the purpose of the decode stage in pipelining,Neutral
AMD,Please enlighten me how the RDNA 4 uArch inherently doesn’t scale down from 16 WGPs? Which front or back-end limitations it has so that it can't scale.,Negative
AMD,Welcome to reddit,Positive
AMD,"RDNA 3.5 WGP should be smaller than RDNA 4 WGP. From an area efficiency standpoint its preferable to add support for FP8 and INT8 than create a RDNA 4 based iGP from scratch, yes.  As for the scaling, the ISA is independent from hardware design. It can scale up or down as much as wanted, although with limits to what it can be achieved, of course.",Neutral
AMD,"You were the one that made the extraordinary claim there, it’s on you to provide extraordinary evidence to support “the ISA has nothing to do with hardware design.”  The burden is not on other people to prove the negative of your claim. It’s on you to prove the positive.",Neutral
AMD,"The whitepaper, as much as the RDNA 4 ISA reference guide are freely available to anyone to read. If you encounter a single mention of the ISA/uArch not scaling down from 16WGPs or how the hardware design of Navi 44 is the minimum of RDNA 4, please feel free to share to everyone.  I'll give you a hint: The smallest working hardware implementation of RDNA 4 continues to be a WGP.",Neutral
AMD,"I agree that RDNA4 can theoretically scale down, but I completely disagree with the blanket statement that “ISA has nothing to do with hardware designs”.  ISA can and does drive hardware designs decisions and vice-versa.",Neutral
AMD,"""Smallest working implementation"" and ""Smallest *efficient* implementation"" can be pretty different things. You'll probably balance a number of things rather differently in different contexts, different cache amounts, different ratios of compute/bandwidth, different bus fanout widths etc.  And there's a *lot* of low-level optimization to get the area/power/clocks to hit targets that *are* layout specific - it's not just as easy as ""make NUM_WGP=1"" and actually get *competitive* results out the end.",Neutral
AMD,"It's because AMD doesn't do it, so obviously there is a technical reason why AMD is doing so",Neutral
AMD,Or a business reason,Neutral
AMD,"This still remains one of the biggest marketing foot-guns I have ever witnessed.  The biggest benefactor of the FSR4 INT8 release would be the thousands of Handheld PCs where AMD have basically stalled out at RDNA 3.5. All the Steam Decks, Legion GOs, XBOX Allys are all stuck with FSR3 from the AMD camp.  I use it on my Legion GO (via an Optiscaler plugin for Bazzite/SteamOS) and it absolutely dunks all over FSR3.  AMD could really lose the handheld market in a single generation with Intel's B390 release.  Not to mention the fact that AMD users can get a better upscaler by substituting FSR3 for Intel XeSS is hilarious!",Neutral
AMD,"Considering how fast they put rdna2 on maintenance mode, i don't think they want to put resources in rdna3 which will go into maintenance mode in late 2027.",Negative

AMD,"Gamers will question... Sure - that somehow didn't bother Nvidia, despite far bigger performance hit on older architectures",Neutral
AMD,"What AMD should've done is actually put non-shader-based AI compute starting from RDNA2.  RTX 20 series' RT and upscaling performance had always been called into question, but that was back in 2018 and their first attempt at this. It came with hardware accelerated BVH traversal and all the fundamentals to stay relevant for a while.  RDNA2 was launched in 2020 fighting with Nvidia RTX 30 series, and by then they already had known that the competition launched some AI capable hardware.  Fast-forward to 2022 and RDNA3 still didn't come with dedicated AI compute hardware that doesn't weigh down shaders. It is only until early 2025 that they introduced RDNA 4 with FSR4 capable dedicated AI compute accelerators, 6 and a half years later, meanwhile their server accelerators had long had these (starting with CDNA 1).

AMD,I really want to support the Underdog and accept some flaws but with moves like that I want switch to the big player.  You can say what you want but Nvidia did a solid move by cutting off right from the beginning and still supporting the 2000 series cards even if not with all features the 5000 series have.  Switched from my 1070 to 5700XT which aged fine but my 7800 XT probably won't. Let's see how RDNA5 or the RTX 6000 cards will be but this time I will buy what gives me the bang for the buck.,Neutral

They also promote a bunch of games and showcase many new AAA sponsored games with those technologies.  If all those things Nvidia did to gaming are ignored and treated as a given, and still got them labelled as ""Don't care about gaming, only focus on AI"", then what the fuck is AMD, who give literally nothing compared to Nvidia, and on top of that treating their consumers like shit by abandoning all the previous gen",Positive

AMD,"That's absolutely true, but it's a new and growing segment. AMD treating it so poorly is such a short sighted move, as carving out the segment is not only good for AMD but for x86 as a whole.

AMD,"Yep!  I'm running Bazzite on my Legion GO and use a combination of the Proton variable for FSR4 and Decky/Optiscaler plugin for XeSS.  It's also hilarious to me that the Source release blunder means that, technically, the INT8 code was released under the MIT License.  So they can't even stop people from redistributing it.",Neutral
AMD,"> Your entire perception of what the market looks like is wildly incorrect.  In what way?  The handheld gaming market is fairly niche, but absolutely gaining momentum.  What we know for sure, is that Intel is ready to drop new hardware that is significantly faster than AMD (who have no plans for at least 12 months).  That's a pretty big opening for Intel to grab up market share based on technical superiority alone.",Neutral
AMD,"From what I've seen on my LeGo, it's still worth it.  On the gen1 Legion Go it's actually uniquely positioned to benefit as it has a 2560x1600 screen, so running FSR4 in performance mode nets a better image than a native Steamdeck (1280x800).  The main benefit is that FSR4 doesn't break up horribly like FSR3 does at low resolutions. e.g.  FSR3 performance on most handheld screens is a garbled mess.",Positive

AMD,"FSR 3.8 is fine; not quite FP8 FSR4, so brand it under FSR3. It can mark the end of the FSR 3.x line.  Not sure why they're being stubborn about FSR4. Honestly, AMD could just use conversion instructions and provide full FSR4 to RDNA3/3.5 and 3.7 (""RDNA4m""). I think, maybe, AMD wants GPUs to support the entire Redstone stack going forward. That's where FSR 3.8 branding makes sense as a standalone upscaler based on FSR4.",Neutral

AMD,"Turing was absolutely forward-looking, but it was also comparatively expensive at launch and didn't offer the big gen-on-gen raster gains everyone had become accustomed to. We know it was the future *now*, but if you were looking at it back then as a Maxwell or Pascal owner it didn't really do much to sell itself.   Meanwhile AMD came out with the 5700XT that offered ballpark 1080ti performance for $399. It's not hard to see why the narrative went the way it did.",Negative
AMD,Turing’s super refresh also addressed the value aspect. I don’t know any unhappy 2000 Super buyers.,Neutral
AMD,Even funnier when you look at Intel and Arc. Arc released with RT and ML in mind and I believe their cards take a lower hit from enabling RT than AMD's.   And even XeSS 2 is getting features before FSR,Neutral
AMD,"And funny how RDNA 1 like 5700XT at the time was treated as gold standard compared to Turing, which everyone trashing on, now RDNA 1 is not even supported for driver anymore, can't run many games due to lacking even mesh shader, zero RT hardware so can't run many new games, and even if it could the experience is horrible with absolutely garbage upscaling and zero feature, the 5700XT aged like rotten milk while Turing is more than fine wine",Negative
AMD,"To be fair ray tracing is still not really a thing that's worth the performance hit, which is what people were saying back then.  DLSS, which is now the real ""magic"" of RT cores, was also ***horrendous*** in its first incarnation, wasn't  *really* needed, and only really got acceptable in late 2022 with DLSS 3.  Doesn't change the fact that you're right about everyone clowning on it but it turned out to be a pivotal tech though... It would just have been so hard to just believe back then given the actual performance.",Negative

AMD,"No they don´t always have to be the reason of their own downfall. AMD was an absolute CPU Underdog up to 2018/19 and built their way up with fair prices, meaningful improvements and big promises like supporting AM4 for a long time. My support was rewarded as I got a cheap upgrade possibility by selling my 3600 and buying a 5800X3D.     I gave them my trust with the GPUs too and my old Sapphire 5700XT Nitro+ did a good job by having an awesome buy and sellprice (bought it for 360 euros brand new in 11/19 and for 160 in 02/24) and a good feature support. Why shouldn´t I give AMD another try? The Underdog did deliver a great value for me.",Positive
AMD,"It sucks that their drivers are closed source, but it's far from ""crap"" in Linux.",Negative
AMD,"Maybe it's just me, but going from a 7900XTX to a 4090 was a night and day difference, even in linux. 4090 *just worked*. Whereas the AMD card would have constant driver timeouts and crashes in specific games(especially those that didn't like AMD in the first place) despite being RMA'd twice.  Sure, maybe i got unlucky, but i've had pretty much zero problems with nvidia on linux. Maybe it's because i run a rolling release distro though, i can see it being rough if you're constantly on older versions via LTS or something like bazzite which is immutable.",Neutral
AMD,It would be really nice to see Nvidia open up their drivers on Linux because that is a real sticking point for many. We just rely on Nvidia to fix stuff there for us instead of being able to do it ourselves. You would think considering Linux is the primary OS in industry they would support it better?,Positive
AMD,"People saying this kept me from switching for a long time. And when I did, I discovered that things work fine. My 4090 hums along and I can still use DLSS and RTX features.",Positive
AMD,"You don't have to as your 9070 XT will work fine with FSR4 while my 7800XT will artificially get castrated because AMD sold me Hardware they themselves don't use (""AI Cores"")",Negative

AMD,MFG is only a RTX 50 series feature but DLSS 4.5 works perfectly on 20 series.,Positive
AMD,"If that ends up being the case, which i find highly doubtful, at least on the short-mid term, specially knowing that there's a very real possibility that the AI bubble ends up bursting, there will always be Intel as a secondary option(and even if Intel wasn't there and the AI bubble never bursts, it literally makes no sense for NVIDIA to completely abandon a market where they hold more than 70% of total market sales. What is likely to happen is that NVIDIA puts less and less focus on gaming GPUs, but never stops making them fully)  And if Intel is shit too, i would rather not buy a GPU at all than give money to Radeon again.",Negative
AMD,NVIDIA has 4.5-5 billion a quarter gaming revenue. Why would they drop that market that's low risk and guaranteed. Putting all your eggs in one basket is never a good idea.,Negative

AMD,"Honestly quality FSR 3.1 on 4k looks almost decent, but with the negativity, I can see why they dont want to release an inferior version of FSR4.",Negative
AMD,"Honestly, releasing it with a SPECIAL name would be the best solution. Like FSR4 lite or FSR4 preview name.",Positive
AMD,"Most consumers, even if they have a custom PC, will default to ""install the latest drivers"". If that means negative performance, I can see a good reason why AMD would not release such a driver.",Negative
AMD,Because then the same crowd wanting this now would then proceed to complain that it sucks balls compared to the old version?  Seems pretty obvious there isn’t any satisfying the outraged gamer crowd.,Negative
AMD,"There is a lot of negativity on reddit towards AMD. for upscaling there are two things to consider: quality and performance. If AMD released fsr4 for rdna3, they wouldnt have any advantage over DLSS either in performance nor in quality. (FSR4 quality is good but still inferior to latest DLSS versions).",Negative

AMD,Sony supposedly put a lot of effort in themselves to help develop it (according to Mark Cerny). Could be SONY permission is required.,Neutral

AMD,because the last time AMD made a good GPU product was over 10 years ago.,Negative
AMD,"I'd say the ""Nvidia research to standard feature pipeline"" has been pretty well established at this point... RTX, DLSS, Framegen, Reflex, Gsync, other AI rendering stuff (RR, NRC, NTC)... sure, they're not the ones who ""invent"" them sometimes (although they do contribute a shit ton of research in novel fields that people typically don't know about until it hits consumer products), but they're clearly the driving force behind modern gaming features.   Part of that might be corporate culture, part of it might just be that Nvidia's 90% of the gaming market, part of it is just gaming adapting to the hardware the market provides (if you're a AAA game dev now or developing any sort of technically ambitious feature, you are building your engine/game from the ground up with features like RT/PT/DLSS/Framegen/NRC whatever else from the ground up- future cards are going to have insane matrix math capabilities to support AI, so we take our current gaming computation problems and turn them into matrix math problems- that's just the general hardware market shaping gaming tech).   There's a feedback loop, but yeah, Nvidia's certainly putting in the work, and I'm sure they *wish* they could make an extra billion or two sellings GPUs to gamers on top of their AI profits- current supply and demand doesn't support that though.",Positive
AMD,"The whole ""NVIDIA doesn't care about gaming"" idea has always been absolute bullshit. Obviously no massive corporation ""cares"" in the way we humans might care about something, that is a given. But the idea that NV is somehow *uniquely disdainful* of gamers is childish and facile, and has no basis in observable fact.   If anything, it's the opposite: as someone who has been a PC gaming enthusiast for decades, I think NV has actually done more for me in that position than any other company (except, perhaps, Valve). Obviously they do so for business reasons; but the way they decide to act has been frequently beneficial to PC gaming.  As one massive (for me) example, I remember the first post-CRT decade in the monitor market where 60 Hz was just seen as **the** standard, and that was basically it. Which was very bleak from an action gaming perspective. And what really started to change that whole trajectory was the introduction of G-Sync -- not so much just the technology itself but more so getting the whole stagnant monitor industry to see the value of creating gaming-focused products.",Neutral
AMD,Slight clarification: MFG 6X/dynamic is RTX 5000 only. But all RTX GPU do get the new transformer model for upscaling.,Neutral
AMD,amen probably the best comment ive see in a very long time,Positive

Within a year or two, the OpenCL backend on AMD slowly started [accumulating bugs](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/65924) that blender devs couldn't fix from their end and everyone had to fallback to using CPU rendering, which is magnitudes slower than GPU rendering.

High performing matrix cores were probably a requirement for a high quality temporal upscaler and RT denoiser as well.   Microsoft were known to be on-the-fence regarding AMD partnership for next Xbox, and I'm betting AMD were under pressure to ensure RDNA4 performed, as AMD could show progress to MS and extrapolate performance based on AMD projections of RDNA5.

So, intead of trees with leaves and branches, you got this clumpy malformation of trees with a bunch of green colors that were supposed to be leaves that looked like something from 10 years prior. The upscaler also wasn't great as Nvidia was trying to make the tensor cores do too many things at once.  DLSS2 was where Nvidia turned the corner. That actually started with shader-based DLSS 1.9 that debuted in Control. This moved to a generalized training algorithm based on temporal multi-frame accumulation (TAA-based). Image softness and ghosting were still issues though, so AMD's contrast adaptive sharpening often provided better results when combined with a basic upscaler.

Neither of these features existed in mainline DisplayPort at the time VESA had no intention of doing so.  It took nearly **2 years** after G-Sync was announced for VESA to announce their implementation into the DP1.2a spec and still more time after that because the LFC logic had to be built into the GPU (1st Gen G-Sync actually had LFC built-in to the custom ARM SBC they were using as the Display Controller+TCON).

For example a lot of them had a really, really narrow update frequency where VRR actually worked. With G-Sync it did not matter what your refresh was, it would also be VRR and smooth. It accomplished this by various techniques like doubling frames at the really low refresh rates.   With a lot of the early FreeSync monitors, we had monitors that would only enable VRR at specific update frequencies, like maybe 48-75 Hz and as soon as you had higher or lower FPS than that, VRR would get disabled.

But at least it woke up MS enough to bother to create Xbox FSE.  Think about that for a second though, the company that is currently obsessed with shoving cloud subscriptions and CoPilot down everyone's throats actually built something for Windows for the niche handheld market.  Granted, they probably vibe-coded it....  The competition is ultimately good thing as it has at least forced hardware to be iterated through quite quickly.  Notably, very few handhelds are using re-purposed tablet displays (ie Vertical native) now that the market is large enough.  So even display manufacturers are coming to the party.  We're also now seeing things like VRR becoming more or less ubiquitous.  > Either Panther Lake isn't as good as is being claimed, or someone is up to no good.

AMD,But here’s the thing. It’s hypocritical because how do they expect PC gaming to get better when they don’t promote alternatives to get off of the Nvidia/AMD duopoly?   The only companies we have at the high end is Nvidia/AMD.   Intel isn’t going to invest heavily into discrete ARC GPU’s if they don’t have a large enough market share.

Even there some integrated gpu are able to run realytime raytraced games like cyberpunk, granted with a tonne of compromises and at like 30fps but as a proof of concept thats crazy.   For the average gamer using like 3060 levels of graphics I don't think most people would care if that came in the form of an integrated chip. Hardware heads, like myself, will likely always have their eye on higher specs but most people would be fine with games running through aggressive upscaling as long as framerates are relatively consistent.

And even now nothing is made concrete by leakers like MLID, when you watch MLID now at times the way he phrases stuff makes it look like Nvidia is hardly supplying / fabbing chips atm for all the Sku's that fall under their gaming division.

There is just too much to gain from unifying everything. All the memory bandwidth you can cram in can benefit both the CPU and the GPU (and anything else that's in there). Maybe we'll get another round or two of viable traditional PC architecture but I think it's possible even for the next iteration of strix halo (medusa halo) to render all but top end gaming obsolete.  Even a 5090 which is difficult to even find a way to closely fully utilize from most gaming software in existence (due to being optimized for more modest hardware) is a baby next to the training and inference optimized nvidia hardware now... I look forward to good healthy competition between intel/nvidia APUs and AMD APUs. Surely some design will be forthcoming that can give good PCIe bandwidth to connect a top end discrete GPU and it will be a nice compact workstation powerhouse platform.   Let's not discount the value that can come out of locally running huge LLM models resident in huge unified memory and efficiently inferenced at good speed by onboard NPUs and tensor cores.,Neutral

AMD,"They’re not a saint, but neither is AMD/Nvidia currently.  Let me put it this way, people have been stating that the price increases for these “budget” GPU’s has been an issue.  For example, a 9060XT is ~£400 and a 5060Ti is ~£450 whereas a budget card a decade ago with the RX580 was ~£300.   Yet content creators still push the 9060XT and the 5060Ti as “budget” cards.   They should change their definition of “budget” to be done by actual price. Because if they’re complaining that “budget” cards by AMD/Nvidia are increasing in price, Intel still sells a real budget card for £270-300.  “Budget” is an objective measure based on price to performance. Yet content creators still push cards that are objectively worse for those figures.   HW Unboxed made a video a month back comparing the 9060XT and the B580 as “budget” cards. The B580 is £120 cheaper than the 9060XT, how is that even a comparison?",Negative
AMD,"People have been complaining about the “inflation” with the different tiers of cards produced.   For example, a 9060XT is more expensive as a “budget” card than the RX 480 from a decade ago which was also a budget card.   Yet YouTubers like HW Unboxed frequently still call the 9060XT a “budget” card, despite that. In fact [he compares it to the B580 as a budget card](https://youtu.be/xlbNsP5ySmA) despite the B580 being £120 cheaper than a 9060XT. Of course people are going to look at those graphs and decide not to buy a B580 as a real budget option.   People can’t complain about the inflation of “budget” cards if they are basing the “budget” aspect on the naming scheme of the cards.   A B580 can be bought for £270, around the same price as a RX 480 a decade ago. Thats a budget card. The 9060XT and the 5060Ti aren’t “budget” cards yet YouTubers keep saying they are because of the model numbers.   “Budget” should be objectively based on the price of the cards, not the naming scheme assigned to them.

AMD,I'd be interested to know what your reaction would be if the video was about real massive price decreases.,Neutral
AMD,"The only thing questionable about their video was the original title and thumbnail. The actual video itself was very clear about what was happening. Nvidia was reducing supply of the 5070 ti to the point where brands like ASUS would no longer be bothering to produce them.

We're working our butts off to make sure that happens but it's still a pretty tight schedule.   The main conflict is about ethics. We sell GPUs because companies/customers buy them. But they're leading to the RAM shortage, uptick in AI and data center fabrication, and a huge push in all things AI is leading to things such as PC consumers, console and handheld manufacturers scrambling for scraps and a global impact on the affordability of the personal computer and how long a typical lifecycle is for a PC.

AMD,"I have a 7900XT.   Thry developed new software like FSR4 and the Redstone package that is proven to run on legacy cards and they restrict it only for the RDNA4 cards.   The 9070-9060 cards are super solid and yet there are no extra variants of hardware like slim cards, single slot cards, SFF versions, etc so only the most average spec is covered.    They also keep releasing APUS with RDNA3.5 instead of 4,and have confirmed that until Medusa Point they will continue to do so, so for everyone waiting on a much more powerful FSR4 powered Steam Deck you are on the waiting list until 2028 at the earliest.   Basically they have the capscity to make top tier competitive hardware in both pricing and specs, and then they do the absolute bare minimum after they reach that point.   If you are looking for a gaming or productivity card and are on the market for a 9060-9070 you are fine, well served and honestly they are quite impressive cards, so don't let my comment disuade you from them.

AMD,"AMD puts very little priority on their GPU division sadly. Making their products lesser than what they easily could be.  However it will work fine for the general pc user/gamer. Nvidia has a bit more features and their similar features are usually more developed on Nvidias end. In short, you have to pay a bit more to get better software. But both brands work perfectly fine for gaming. There's alternatives when it comes to frame generation and upscaling that usually work fine, very rarely even slightly better.  If you're just going to game you'll be just fine with AMD, I've used many different manufacturers of GPU's throught the years since I built my first PC in 1998 and I can tell you that hardware, software and drivers etc are far, far more stable today than it's ever been. What I mean is that even if AMD were to have twice the amount of driver issues for the avg person, there would still be very few issues or even none for a majority part of users.  It's very easy to get confirmation bias on the internet due to the vast amount of users and how easy it is to get your voice out today. I've certainly fallen for it as well as most others. I like others get more vocal when we have issues and we humans are very much affected by the opinion of the masses.",Neutral

The 'scraps' for PC consumers might feel thin right now, but there’s a strong argument to be made for shifting consumer components toward older, more stable fab processes that have better yields and lower costs.

The rumor comes from ""leakers"". They are probably doing it because the average laptop chip doesn't care about a large igpu boosting gaming perf. Most laptops pair a mid or premium tier soc with nvidia's dgpu because oems can't afford to pass up the nvidia branding and that turns the premium igpu socs kinda obsolete in the market  You might have thought that pantherlake is great, but according to intel's earnings call the margins are less than 35% which is horrible.

AMD,"> P+E is **one** of the few things Intel did well.  Well, that's a hard ""No, surely NOT!"" — Barely anything with it was done any well.  Their P+E Cores, while being a workable compromise-solution for the interim born out of necessity (which was initially supposed for helping them out of their ever self-inflicted process-woes), they have been done awfully bad in the fields with P+E in general.  It has been a really crappy job so far and Intel totally delivered a capital blunderbuss basically all along the way. And the worst part wasn't even, that the whole thing was mainly driven by sheer panic and pure desperation of Intel's own management — The absolute worst was that anything P+E is again another Intel-product, which was severely crippled already ahead of start …  That's when their unsound marketing, as it's usually the case, was rushing way ahead before engineering and, like *always*, were already frantically beating the drum on anything of their new *Hybrid&nbsp;Architecture* left, right and center — Like Intel was about to bring users with their P+E Cores into the Promised Land themselves …  *At a time, when Intel's* ***own*** *engineers in the background haven't even really figured out the whole thing in its entirety, and what it should or could look like in practice!*  ---- While their oh so original approach of a mere copycat of ARM's hugely successful big.LITTLE-paradigm (gone horribly wrong on Intel's end at that) *could've had* (engineering-wise) ***potentially*** *been a fairly reasonable stop-gap solution* at least in theory (if it had been executed any good). In practice, Intel completely dropped the solder-ball on every corner of their P+E Cores and threw a awfully half-baked, plain indefensible botched-up work onto the market and towards the end-users (especially software-wise), inflicting heavy scheduling-issues and came with tons of other problems along with it …  Non-working copy-protection breaking games, incredibly high latency-issues for anything audio-processing, HUGELY increased performance-penalties for any virtualization (context-switch penalties), heavy slow-downs in file-operations (every `SysCall` crippling the system) and whatnot.  I mean, we get it: Their P+E Core Hybrid&nbsp;Architecture was initially supposed to cover for their infamous 10nm™ process-woes, and for being able to compete with AMD's proclaimed ~~Corean War~~ *War on Cores*™ by cramping a reasonably enough amount of cores (or as many as possible) onto a package to compete in the market, but Intel's chaotic execution over the whole thing was abysmal and the end-products just horrible.  Intel just threw a mostly unfinished product onto the market, just for others to deal with any arising problems for scheduling a heterogenous core-setup (which the x86 universe **wasn't** remotely prepared for anyway to begin with!), only for then make it ten times worse THEMSELVES with their idiotic *Thread&nbsp;Director*, which complete screwed any scheduling afterwards …  All in all, Intel with P+E Cores over-promised and at the same time under-delivered, as always.",Negative

Intel is doing a similar thing today that made Ryzen successful, which doesn't stop them from losing market share.  Intel launched Alder Lake 4 years ago, which had the highest ST, MT, and gaming performance per $. Except delivered via a heterogeneous architecture. The bad press around the architecture, among others, was why Intel wasn't able to stop its momentum loss with that product line.  It was a strong message that a large chunk of the market that drives product popularity rejected it, and that there is a lot of value in predictable performance that homogeneous CPUs deliver, over an extra edge in MT performance that a large chunk of the market does not find use in, and prioritize not getting handicapped by erratic performance or (no matter how rare) software incompatible or misbehaving when up against heterogeneous chips.",Neutral

AMD,"Good breakdown - if the RAM crunch really drags into 2027, it makes sense we will see more quiet delays and soft cancellations rather than clean generational launches.",Neutral
AMD,"If Intel seizes the opportunity and makes the follow on to Panther Lake and Nova Lake with twice the number of Xe tiles, then this may meet the needs of 80% of the gamers, and Nvidia and AMD may find themselves with no commercial market for discrete GPU cards.  The high end Pather Lake has 12 Xe cores, and it brings 1080p gaming to all day laptops. I wonder what 24 Xe would do, and of course the same approach applies to doubling whatever Nova Lake comes out with.  Intel could repeat the early days of the PC market when embedded VGA graphics eliminated the need for cards like the Diamond Speedstar and all the other discrete cards like it.",Neutral

AMD,"he was basing on that based on the uplift from Phoenix to hawk point which was . . . a single data point and probably should have never been used to make predictions. As AMD clearly didn't do that this round and, to my knowledge, has never done previously except with hawk point.  I do think that if the 470 is paired with max speed memory it supports, it's igpu should game \~15-20% faster than the 370 (which only supports lower bandwidth/speed memory). But so far its pretty difficult to dig up any comparisons on that front. But at any rate the lack of FSR4 kinda makes this incremental gain pointless anyways. Lack of AMD actually getting gorgon point in laptops at a reasonable price point just makes it even more Ludacris.  AMD botching it again and again. I think the refresh is fine. Sometimes that is just how product cadence works. But there are so many things they just CANNOT seem to get right in the laptop and GPU space that were easy wins . . . FSR 4, price points, and getting laptops with decent memory specs to get better performance were totally within their control. If we saw gorgon laptops for \~$500 less with FSR4 and +20% igpu gaming . . . those would be legit decent deals. But . . . that isn't what we have.  gorgon point in a premium laptop doesn't make sense IMO unless its a premium laptop at a lower price with some really good bios and power management. Which . . . Lettuce be reality. no laptop OEM is going to put in that kind of R&D for a refreshed chip . . . .

AMD,"the fact that X3D laptop chips still haven't made it as a more common choice is wild  like you'd think they would jump on that chance but they really did not invest in the needed packaging expansion or something to really push that out in volume  hell, like I said before, if they can get proper eGPU with proper x16 links out (and not just oculink speeds), a laptop with a -50 class mGPU and a eGPU can likely accept a 5090 class easily and have that be actually something of a true ""desktop replacement""  a 9800HX3D with that would be a killer app of a laptop that can likely last for multiple gens of CPU advancement while the GPU gets swapped out more frequently.",Negative

That being said, this is something I said was gonna happen when people were debating PTL prices a few weeks ago: new models from both AMD and Intel are gonna reset MSRPs and be more expensive than last years models because of other factors, like RAM/SSD.  PTL-H is certainly more expensive than Gorgon Point, but with the SoC taking up a smaller % of the total laptop BOM, it might not matter much if the price difference between a Gorgon Point and PTL-H laptop ends up being $1800 vs $1850, for example",Negative

Last time I saw testing we are talking a couple of percent difference. 12400 (same cache as 13500H which is used in a lot of budget gaming laptops) locked at 4GHz. Was only around 3-4% slower on average than 12900K with 2-p and e-cores off also at 4Ghz from what I remember when I saw some testing years ago.   The biggest benefit still remains, which is the lower memory latency vs the chiplet/tile designs.  Now at low power (<35W) it can switch over due to efficiency of the other architectures/nodes. But that's generally not where you find most gaming laptops.",Neutral

They aren't bound by contracts with nvidia or amd or their connections, and they don't exactly have much with AIBs either, not since we are sanctioned to hell and back. So, in this climate of being generally poor, with prebuilts coming with parts that people want to have because system integrators have their hands untied, there are currently about 1600 various offerings with 5070ti.

AMD,"Pricing is consequence, not the cause. If AMD made 3-4 times more RDNA4 cards those naturally would have been at MSRP and AMD could have sold them all, especially while Nvidia also had not enough supply before summer. But AMD strategy is CPU and data center focused, consumer GPUs literally don't get enough wafers to take away meaningful market share from Nvidia.

As much as the marketing engine wants us all to believe otherwise, FSR and DLSS are upscaling technologies that were designed to trade performance/framerates for reduced image quality.    The heaviest weight in video card selection should still be basic rasterized rendering performance at your choice of resolution in the games you play most often.   This is what you are going to lean on most often for the life of the card while you are gaming... the rest is situation nice-to haves or concessions of image quality or latency in trade for framerates and perceived ""smoothness.""  Ray Tracing is still inconsistently supported and implemented and comes with a huge performance penalty even in Nvidia's product stack that often requires leaning on reduced image quality or greater latency with upscaling/framegen tech.   It's a tech demo feature that gets a ton of it's value from marketing hype vs widespread support and optimization in games.  I still don't consider RT a mainstream tech, cards that can support it natively while maintaining consistently better than 60 FPS 1% lows are going to land in the 4080 / 5070ti performance class or higher .. which is back in $1000+ territory with the effective discontinuation of the non -80 series 16gb cards in the Nvidia lineup recently.  Cyberpunk 2077, a 5 year old and highly Nvidia optimized game, still struggles to stay above 60 FPS on the 1% lows with RT/medium presets enabled on a 7800x3D machine at 1440p while making the whole experience look like weirdly ""shiny"" like someone poured epoxy over everything.",Neutral

AMD,"What I hate about all the gazillions benchmarks done by reviewers and tech influencers about how important RAM speed is that they never test manually tweaked RAM, they only test EXPO/XMP, which is considerably slower than even loose but manually tweaked timings. So people get the impression that RAM speed doesn’t matter because reviewers are comparing slow RAM with slow RAM. It seems like people also ignore that fast RAM smoothes out the frame pacing and can be the difference between a stutter-less experience and a stuttery mess even if the average frame rate stays the same. The linked test didn’t even attempt to show the 0.1% lows, so it’s worthless.   Buildzoid said a million times that gamers are unable to understand how RAM works and it always checks out.",Negative

AMD,"From personal experience I've only ever seen a major uplift upgrading from DDR3 to DDR4 (observed in OW 1), which seemed to give me about a 10% uplift. I've upgraded to RAM with a higher clock speed afterward and didn't really notice much- it doesn't seem like the juice is worth the squeeze at a certain point.",Neutral
AMD,"Idk. I have seen serious in depth tests by overclockers, and it seems, 6400 1:1 is the sweet spot. The caveat is, it only makes a serious difference when it's running FPS unlocked and the CPU is near 100%, then the fps gains are very much worthy, like from 120 to 160 and low 1% get better as well. The thing about ram overclocking is that you only really see real gains when the CPU is near max, since the 3XD cache gets full and needs to access memory more (like the other comments clarified).     I like tinkering a little (not an overclocker) and since ram was cheap back then (lol) I got a 6400 kit and run at 1:1. Took time and testing, but I had fun, I guess :P     I think for the most part, the fun part was learning. Now I know a lot more about ram and their settings. However, if I was time constrained and had less patience, I would just run 6000mhz and the lowest CAS I could find at an affordable range.    I play on 4k, doing 6400 1:1 probably didn't even get any fps gains, was just the fun of tinkering and getting my PC to be as good as possible    I avoided Infinity Fabric overclocking and going too low at the secondaries and tertiaries. Plus I ran the SOC at 1.3. The amount of extra time testing everything would take too much time.",Neutral
AMD,"IIRC back in the DDR3 days, as long as you are on at least 1600, you were good, anything above like 1866 and 2133 were deemed waste of money. 1600 was the vast vast majority of ddr3 around the time of intel 3rd/4th gen, they were cheap and very available. I think it was only after the release of Zen1, people started to put more focus on ram, because Zen really benefits from it due to fclk, on 6th gen intel, which was also ddr4, people just bought whatever is the cheapest.",Neutral

AMD,"It can actually be quite big with non-Vcache chips.  Depends on the specific kit of course, there's more to it than just the MT/s.  Generally the bigger problem with low MT/s kits is that they're some of the lowest quality DDR5 out there and will usually have poor latency as well for overall poor performance.  Like straight up, you can nerf your performance by a whole generation of CPU performance(10-15%) with poor RAM in certain cases.",Neutral

AMD,"The amount of people that buy 5090 is significantly higher than the amount of people that tune memory. You could ask instead why they review Intel GPUs.

That being said, yeah, IMO the PSU is something you should *never* cheap out on.

AMD,"Well that's the same as 6400Mhz with DDR5.  Ideally if you could overclock both memory and IF to the same factor, there's a small reward, but 3200Mhz got you most of the way to what DDR4 was gonna deliver for you.",Neutral

AMD,yeah id say its about bellow 6 GB where it becomes hard to use windows.,Neutral
AMD,Sure that is true it depends on the workload. If the workload is load from ram use once and never use again like LLMs (but who runs them on a CPU?) then benefit from X3D cache is none. But most stuff like game engines run a loop thousands of times on the similar data. It does not have to fit in the cache - even if half of it fits this half is already there.

AMD,"For LLMs or image gen running locally on consumer hardware, you often have to blend the workload and split layers between GPU and CPU (ex: Flux dev FP16 or non quantized models / bigger LLMs) even on a 4090. This uses your CPU and GPU, and then becomes reliant on system RAM bandwidth, while also still giving pretty high performance. It's why people can run huge models on a 4090 and it still be pretty fast. 14900k is better in this case.   Same with RT - in RT games, they seem to miss L3 cache and hit system memory (I don't know why).

AMD,"i highly \*100%\* suggest getting an FW 360x AIO (frozen warframe) -you need your own fans, its 50 bucks on amazon. keeps my 5800x cool and thats with pbo pushing to 5ghz, plus prime95, occt, ycruncher/etc cant push the cpu past 80c.  on a decent air cooler id see 90c in no time and specific games id see 80c most the time. (before someone says thermal paste, i double checked) it was the cpu just being hot af lol. anyways with the FW360x ive had no issues with high temps since. for the record, it never crashed or anything from temps. i just didnt like 80c playing games at 1440p/4k.  p.s. my 5800x is paired with a 4070ti, and 32gb of ram. have yet found a game i couldn play at 1440p or 4k.",Positive

AMD,"I was just in your exact situation, but with an i5 10400F.  The thought process was that it wasn’t gonna be for a serious gaming build, but I want to get the best parts I can use for the rig until the end of its life while spending the least amount of money.  This is most especially considering the upgrade cost to DDR5, and the mobo I use can only take until 11th gen max.  I ended up scoring a used i5 11500 for 70USD, which let me keep my B560 motherboard.  Since the 10400F also didn’t have PCIe 4.0 lanes, the move to 11500 will enable the first M.2 slot on my mobo and allow me to use my Gen 4 SSD at intended speeds.  So whilst the “best” would have been to move to AM4 and 5600X/5700X3D, it would have probably cost me triple or quadruple of what I spent now, which I didn’t find worth it for my use case, so I ended up just getting the best CPU I could find for my mobo.  I would have gone with a 11700 or 11900 but those seem like unicorns where I am.  Super happy with my upgrade and bonus on getting (inadvertently) an igpu along the way.  I’m not sure if this path would suit you, but check out what performance the 11th gen Intel CPUs will give you for the games you’re looking at playing and decide from there.  If it’s no good, then honestly I would just move to AM5 if I were you.  Good luck.",Neutral
AMD,"Since you've already got a LGA 1200 motherboard on hand, I'd go with the 11400F.  It's not *that* far off of the 5600X, and at some point your RTX 2060 will become the limiting factor anyhow.",Neutral
AMD,Thank you for your time to write this. I actually decided to go with i5-11400F as well because i just realised that my next upgrade would be to DDR5 when its more affordable so why upgrading to AM4 . Its surely slightly better than what i chose now but its not worth it as you said too.,Neutral
AMD,"I'm glad you found it useful.  Sometimes this hobby teaches us to objectively look at things; like if paying X% more is worth it for Y% uplift, and more often than not when we put things into perspective that way we realize a lot of what we want can really just be attributed to FOMO.

AMD,I have a 3060 and i loved it. Evga base 3060 12gb. I just upgraded to a 5070 OC and i love it too. For what the market is like right now id definitely say its good. Newer gpus will beat it on fps tests but the 3060 still kicks ass. I have a 5700x3d but the 7900 is a pretty good cpu. Ram and storage is whats going to break your wallet,Positive
AMD,"The Ryzen 9 7900 is a good CPU for non-gaming workloads that need a lot of cores. For gaming it performs roughly on par with the 7600X and is slower than a 9600X.  The RTX 3060 is a 5 year old entry level GPU. A modern entry level $250 RTX 5050, the slowest desktop GPU Nvidia currently makes is about 15% faster. Yes the 3060 has a bit more VRAM, but it's slow enough that it can't really take advantage of that extra VRAM as games that actually need it are generally too demanding for the 3060 to keep up. The extra VRAM also means its used price is somewhat inflated. You can usually get a used 3080 for not much more and that's about twice as fast as the 3060.",Positive
AMD,"The CPU will last you a good long while; the GPU will likely be the first thing to upgrade.  Since you got the parts, you may as well try it first.",Positive
AMD,It's pretty decent for 1440p on medium settings too.  Unless it's a very modern graphically intensive game.   I managed to get a solid 60fps in Tokyo Extreme Racer on 1440p Ultra so not bad at all.,Positive

AMD,">Do I need to switch out my processor then? And should I swap my 3060 for a 3080 or something better?  Did you buy those things new or used? Do you have return options?  If yes, I'd definitely return the 3060 because I think you could do better with something like a 9060 XT or 5060/5060 Ti. The 7900? You could do better and probably save some money with a 9600x/9700x/etc that could get you a higher level GPU.  If no? Just roll with them for a bit. See how things feel when you're playing your games. Once you buy everything else, you're already in an AM5 environment with RAM, a PSU, storage, and case. It'll be easy to upgrade either piece once you figure out which one is an issue.",Neutral

AMD,"That’d be why I’d recommend the 16GB model over the 8GB. The 8GB model is good for now, though starting to show its limits already in some games. The 16GB should be good for several years.",Positive
AMD,I would actually suggest here going with a 14600k config as this would be close to a 5800x3D in gaming performance and much faster everywhere else.  It would also not cost a lot more than a b550/5800x combo if you are purchasing new.  Edit:  Take a look at this to see what I am talking about:  https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i5-14600k/18.html  Using DDR4 will drop gaming performance around 5-10% depending on the game. But it will still be substantially better than a 5800x.   Hopefully that helps 👍,Positive

AMD,"I think focusing on a GPU upgrade is smart. If you want to go with new components, I think you need to decided if you spend $250 to get a solid upgrade, and pocket the $100 for other stuff; or spend $350 and get an ever better GPU upgrade, but then have spent it all. Used market could really help.here, or it could be bust, that's just the nature of things. A B350 is tempting, if you are sure it's driver splay nicely with your games (IIRC, Intel.GPUs had the most compatibility issues with older games, which matches your game list, idk, maybe these have been resolved). Talking new: at the $250 end you have the B350 and the RTX5050; you then can take a step up to the 9060xt and rtx5060, but that gets you closer to $350 and starts presenting vram questions.

AMD,"Yes, this is a straight setup. Guessing its a little more on the expensive side from the look of it. RAM is prob $500-600 (in today's prices). Processor prob running you another \~$300-ish. SSD prob $250-300 (in today's prices). Then there's the GPU as well which may be running you another $600-800 off the strength of that. So we're already at $1750. Not too crazy. The other accessories (considering the tower) prob gonna run another $200 to push you up around $2000. Let me know if that's accurate or not.   $2k for the setup you proposed isn't crazy. You're getting a pretty good PC.   Imo you could get a LOT more bang for your buck if you just opted for a mini-PC (talking better processor & better RAM with a comparable/same GPU). But your $$ is your $$. Among commercial options, what you're being offered really ain't bad. I wouldn't be mad at it per se.

AMD,"Not necessarily. I was just doing the math in my other reply on this thread (before I ever saw OP responding to say how much he was paying). I guessed that Microcenter would charge him $2000. You gotta remember this is a retail chain giant that's going to give consumer sticker prices for their customers.   If you really want to get the \*best\* prices, the best option is to do your homework and purchase the correct parts separately and assemble the entire machine yourself. It seems daunting at first, but later on down the line you will be \*extremely grateful\* that you took the time to learn about these things before taking the plunge and making such a purchase.   Remind yourself that this machine is probably going to be your 'baby' for the next 2-3 years at least (assuming nothing crazy happens to it). So you wanna make sure your device is something you can live with for that long.   With that being said, the user that replied here wasn't wrong in stating that $1700 is still kind of an exorbitant price for what you're getting. The processor only has 8 cores / 16 threads, you only got 32GB RAM & just 1TB SSD. That's what makes me question the cost effectiveness of the setup you got. But I'm skeptical about whether you'll find something better AT Microcenter. You might have to go online or perhaps just buy certain components there at Microcenter and get the rest online.   At the very least, you should do a price comparison between whatever Microcenter is charging for a given component and what you can find it going for online. There are a ton of reputable vendors out there that will provide prices/deals that are better than what you'll find from manufacturers or large retail giants.",Neutral

I bought the last 4080 Super GPU on a shelf in Canada for $1000.  Managed to buy the rest of the parts on sale as well, but the prices didn't jump THAT much compared to these parts.",Neutral
AMD,"I just checked for the PC I built in Jan 2021. Added exactly the same CPU, PSU, Motherboard, SSD and RAM and... these all cost 50 euro more now, five years later.",Neutral
AMD,"Noticed the same thing. My pc, which I built in september 2025 would cost like 1k more to build today",Negative
AMD,"Remember when tech got better and cheaper each generation/year? Those were the days. If you were thinking of upgrading but didn't really NEED to right away, it was always the better choice to wait because you could be sure that something better would come out or most things would go down in price over time. Usually both.  Now it feels like gambling on the stock market. Are prices going to get higher or lower soon? Should you buy now and hope that it was the right decision? What a shit show.",Positive
AMD,Am i ever glad i built my pc in 24.  My ram alone isbalmost $500 now and my gpu alslo almost doubled.  Wild stuff.  My wife thought i was wasting money and then i showed her this and she still saod i wasted $2k but it is better than wasting $4k haha,Positive
AMD,"Honest question.  I was thinking of doing a new build recently, but hadn't pulled the trigger.  Then RAM and Memory prices jumped like crazy.    Do we think that this is something that might stabilize or drop in the next year or so, or is this a situation where no matter what ""buying now is better than buying later""?    My current PC runs well enough and can probably last another 2-3 years, but some of it's parts are getting old (the PSU is from like 2013, but other parts are newer).  These price jumps make me want to wait, but if I wait too long I might hit a point where something in my computer ""gives way"" and then I'm without and stuck buying parts when it might be even more expensive than now.",Negative
AMD,"Big mood. I built a PC just before the tariffs and sky rocketing part prices went down (other than gpu nonsense but that's been the new normal for a bit)  Unfortunately for me I just had my non-OS ssd go silent, haven't cracked my case yet to see if it just got unseated somehow or if the drive is actually bad. Hopefully it's the former.",Negative
AMD,The server I built in November would be 50% more today. Glad I had the foresight to build it and upgrade my PC in the fall.,Positive
AMD,"Last year, I got some more storage drives for my computer. Were about $200 (4TB) and $500 (8TB) USD. Now they're $600 and $1,300. Absolutely nuts.",Neutral

AMD,In other words memory chips are fucking expensive.,Negative
AMD,I'm surprised it's not more.,Neutral
AMD,My ram is almost $900 more than when I bought it in september.,Neutral

AMD,Next week it will be 500% more!,Positive
AMD,And GPU prices! RAM is definitely the major factor though.,Neutral
AMD,"Same.  64GB DDR4 is more than twice what I paid, a few 4TB SSD is more than triple what I paid.  7800 XT I bought is creeping up a bit, about $100 more than what I paid. Hard drives are also getting pricier. I've bought some 18 and 22TB hard drives last year. Today they're roughly 50% more than what I paid and it looks like we may face HDD shortage because some AI clown is trying to buy up everything.",Negative

AMD,"> 4060 going up this much is actually a crime wtf.   No it's not, it's just cherry picking; the card has been out of production for about 2 years and replaced by the 5060. Any 4060 you can find is old stock, usually only at inflated prices.  4060 here in the Netherlands costs 419 EUR, 5060 319 EUR.",Negative
AMD,"I bought $239 worth of RAM in late 2024, and it'd cost me $1060 to repurchase it today...",Negative
AMD,And dont remind me lmao. Stuck with my r5 3600 on my 9060XT cause all the am4 X3D chips are either sold out or double the price they were before ramageddon. Every other upgrade seems not worth it otherwise.,Negative
AMD,You could run wan2gp: [https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP](https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP),Neutral
AMD,2-3 years seems reasonable. And if it's a quality PSU I would trust it forever.,Positive
AMD,The gpu i have is actually still around the same price.  I guess AMD isnt as popular as Nvidia.,Neutral
AMD,"You looked at prices of a specific model of a GPU that's been out of production for 2 years. The cheapest 5060 is likely cheaper and a tiny bit faster.  The same goes for RAM; while the increase in price is outrageous, you can likely find a cheaper 2x16GB 5600+ pair. Vengeance might just be sold out specifically; it's all the same stuff.",Neutral
AMD,A lot of the increase in GPU prices is due to the ram shortages caused by the AI bullshit.  Same thing with how a lot of consumer electronics are increasing in price significantly. It's because they need nand ram chips for installing their software.,Negative
AMD,I also have the 3600 and have been on an endless loop recently trying and failing to find a good am4 upgrade. I think we missed the boat on getting the 5800x3d and may aswell wait until all the DDR5 craziness settles down (not sure it ever will),Negative
AMD,"well at least here in Poland, for example the 9060 xt 16gb went up in price by over 100 bucks, so it seems like the price hike impacted pretty much all gpus",Neutral

AMD,"Whats the budget? Id attempt to shoot for a 5070 oc. Walmart had em for 545 before tax, but if thats out of the budget i understand.",Neutral
AMD,"Walmart near me have 5070s in stock for 500, if you don’t want to go that high then I would look in to the cheapest 9060xt 16gb you can find and then he will be set and won’t need a new gpu at the end of the year. The 8gb cards are already becoming an issue and will not have enough vram for games in the near future",Neutral
AMD,Arc B570/B580 if you just need something to tide you over budget wise.,Neutral
AMD,I think I would get a used GPU over that tbh.. if I am buying new I want 16gb.  You can get him a 6650 XT pretty cheap.. like $150 on eBay.,Neutral
AMD,Intel b580 are surprisingly good for its price 12gb vram,Positive
AMD,"Consider a used 3080 the 10gb models have been going for $250 locally, $350ish for the 12gb. This would be more than a placeholder card to me anyways",Neutral
AMD,"I mean, it's fine  I might lean towards a 16gb 9060 xt  but what the market looks like can change a lot in 2 months or even two weeks at times  what's going to make sense at the end of the year is going to be a guess  If prices stay where they are, then there will likely be a card at that price point that makes sense, but you might need to plan on like 400 or 450   though really, even a 5060 or 8gb 9060 xt wouldn't be a bad replacement, but I would try to get something with 12-16gb unless prices just get even more ridiculously stupid from the memory situation",Neutral
AMD,Consider looking on the used market for a temp card. You can save quite a bit.,Neutral
AMD,"I'd look at 9060xt with 16GB.  Discrete cards simply aren't worth buying new w/o at least 16GB.  Note that AMD offers more value than NVIDIA per dollar, so I would not even look at NVIDIA.",Negative
AMD,"OP linked a 5060 ti 8gb to get right now, as a placeholder. I missed it initially.",Neutral
AMD,Damn that would be perfect but my local store doesn't carry that card,Negative
AMD,"That is such a good deal. I just paid 419€ (almost $500) for a new one in Germany, and some retailers are asking significantly more.",Positive
AMD,I'm trying to stay under 400 for now. I can buy something better later,Neutral
AMD,Micro Center has a 9060 XT 16 GB for $380 but it’s only has one display port,Neutral
AMD,I've never heard of these and I'm seeing them at retailers.,Neutral
AMD,Completely misread that next sentence lmao.   As a place holder that card would be perfectly fine imo for right now. More vram would always be preferred but if the idea is to get something that will be replaced soon then I have zero issues with this over something like a $300 5060.,Neutral
AMD,"Keep an eye on MC 9060xt and snag one when it comes. The $30 more than 5060ti 8b would be worth it. Otherwise if it's a placeholder, just go used market. Can probably find a 6700/7600/3060 for $200 or less, then flip it again for $100-150 when the card you want comes, making it a rental that doesn't bear the full brunt of new-used depreciation.",Neutral
AMD,Oof. Ah well - it'll last you quite a while.,Positive
AMD,"Best card under $400 rn is the 9060XT 16GB, no doubt about it",Positive
AMD,"Honestly, id look for a cheap used rx 6000 serues card or a cheap 1080. The 1080 and 1080ti still kick some serious ass and are way cheaper than a 5060 ti.",Positive
AMD,"Go on Facebook marketplace and look for used GPUs, I recommend 6800 / XT, 3080, and 3080 ti if you can find it under 400.",Neutral
AMD,Can you link it? That’s bizarre.  HDMI to DP adapters are fairly cheap though.,Negative
AMD,"Well, I'd go for the opposite direction: make sure to grab the 16 GB model because, if it's just a placeholder card, the 16 GB one will have a better resale value down the line",Neutral
AMD,The 1080 and 1080ti can't even do rt (which is increasingly becoming a minimum requirement for games) and don't have dlss support. You can fuck around with ls or use fsr or xess but that would have an impact on image quality or performance. I'd rather recommend a used 3060 12gb at this point.,Negative

AMD,Not to mention serving as a effective card for a backup or secondary gaming PC or even just a simple emergency GPU,Neutral
AMD,He said hes buying a replacement card or a better card at the end of the year. My recommendation is something cheap and decent to get by until then. Plenty of games that can be played on a 1080 ti still.,Positive
AMD,"Yup, that's what I'd get!",Neutral
AMD,I would. Your son will be pumped and you will save the money later! Nice find!,Positive
AMD,"Yeah but there are better cards for the value of a 1080 Ti, like a 2070 super, or a 3060 Ti.  1080 Ti is starting to become a collector's piece, it's not competitively priced most of the time",Neutral
AMD,"Fsr 4 is such an improvement, turn it on!",Positive
AMD,Ok thanks. I appreciate it,Positive
AMD,Just hopping in to say i just upgraded to the 9060XT and its genuinely a game changer for my gameplay. Ive been getting over 60fps in everything even the most demanding titles on the market. The card is a beast for the value.,Positive
AMD,I'm picking it up tomorrow for the kid. He better be happy. Lol,Positive
AMD,Genuinely i have to get a second one for my wife and i have a micro center decently near me (an hour or two away) and just got my tax return in so honestly thanks for the find. It'll be significantly cheaper than the first one i bought lmao.   Its insanely good value. Competes with cards twice the price and offers modern gaming tools. Its stronger than his old 6700XT by a good chunk.,Positive
AMD,"What is your budget?   If more, I would stretch to a 9070 XT.   Where would I cut if I had to?   Cheaper cooler. Either a thermalright aio or air.    If you are not married to the case, go to a Lancool 207 if in your area.   Check the power supply here: https://zttbuilds.com/pages/psu-tier-list   I would probably get an A or A- 850 watt.    If you needed to save more to get a higher tier GPU you could go down to a 7600x (though 7800x3d is a great chip).   RAM - get the cheapest 6000 CL30. Corsair is usually higher but depends on region.    SSD check prices to Teamgroup MP33 or MP34 if available. Get cheaper. I may also get 2gb of not terrible because that may prevent you having to upgrade in 5 years. But again. Right now. Stuff expensive.    Load into pcpartpicker and share here if you want more feedback.    Good luck!",Neutral
AMD,"This build is a better allocation of your budget, this is as fast as it gets under £2000. The case in particular is fucking huge, it's also kinda mid, would not recommend.

AMD,Thank you!,Positive
AMD,"Your cooler preference is costing you big style and the graphics card performance is much more important than an aesthetic LCD on your CPU cooler. A video card is fundamental to a gaming PC, an AIO LCD is not. Your CPU is overpowered at a 7800X3D when compared to being paired with only a 9060 XT.  The poster above has given good advice on how to prioritise your budget. You should consider taking it and dropping the LCD fetish or simply spend a bit more to have both. But you put the performance and function of the PC first and aesthetics second. No questions asked.",Neutral
AMD,Could you possibly do a mid tier build for around £1200?,Neutral

AMD,It was fine 5 years ago and it's still reasonably fine today.  You just have to turn down settings for newer games.,Positive
AMD,DDR4 Ram ( yes! ) lol!  I'd say so...  Maybe 3060?  Don't know your budget,Positive
AMD,"Haha, that was my exact build I upgraded from. It can run Cyberpunk with some aggressive DLSS settings @ 60 FPS. You will see a fair amount of tearing with that, but it will run stably.   Might be able to do better, though. 3060 is a much better card if you can find one for a good deal.",Positive
AMD,"Yes, this is still a good enough PC even in 2026. Try to get the RTX 2060 with at least 8GB of memory (not 6GB).",Positive
AMD,"Depends what you use it for. I just upgraded from a 5 3600 and a gtx 1660 super (more or less the same gpu as a 2060 but without raytracing and slightly less vram) to a ryzen 7 5700x and an rtx 5060. I don't play many intensive games so i havent noticed a diff there but in professional creative softwares there's been a huge leap in performance (premier, photoshop, illustrate, and blender)  If you just want to game that's a good setup, as long as you're fine with medium-low graphics (also some new singleplayer titles like indiana jones might not work since they have raytracing you can't turn off, and the 2060 struggles with that feature)",Neutral
AMD,It is but.  I would advise you to save more and spend a better time.,Positive
AMD,Yeah but I would spring for the RTX 2060 Super instead since it has 8GB VRAM and a wider memory bus (The VRAM gets 448GB/s instead of 336GB/s).  I had a similar setup and it was really good. There's also a good upgrade path from there.,Positive
AMD,It's fine with 60Hz monitors,Positive
AMD,"It's decent, but the GPU will be lagging behind, I'd get a 3060.",Neutral
AMD,Hey man thanks so my budget is like 500 to 600,Positive
AMD,"If OP can splurge a bit and get a 5600 instead of the 3600 id recommend it.  I have the 3600 and it is definitely starting to slow things down.  Still meet the minimum on most games I want to play, but just the minimum.  I have a feeling in 1 years time the 3600 won't cut it anymore.  The 5600 should help extend the life of OPs computer by a couple of years.",Neutral
AMD,Thanks man :),Positive
AMD,"I don't know what ""budget"" means to you guys but the 3060 is about twice the price of a 2060. And the often recommended 5600 is about twice the price of a 3600.  OP can just get what they asked for in the title and they'll be happy. Not everyone wants/expects the latest and best graphics.",Neutral
AMD,"You can probably go up to a 3060 or 4060 and a 5000 series cpu on this budget if you're savvy. make sure your ram is DDR4 since thats still relatively cheap. get your motherboard and case second hand (this'll be a big money saver). Find a power supply on sale, I picked up a 750w corsair one on amazon for 50 (usually 80). Could also get a HDD rather than a SSD since it'll be cheaper, will be a lot slower to boot though. but again, if you're here for lower-performance gaming it might not make too much of a difference. I have a 1tb HDD I store my games on and a 300gb SSD I use as my boot drive/easy access storage.",Neutral
AMD,A used 3060 Ti would be better and still within budget if careful. It'd give you some more VRam and a few more raw power for the price: [RTX 3060 Ti 8GB ](https://ebay.us/m/L3dORi),Positive
AMD,That’s a good point. It’s not much more money and will last much longer.,Positive
AMD,Oh okay ty i didnt knew that thank you for that,Positive
AMD,The 5600 is about double the price in a lot of places. That's money that can be spent on the RAM.,Neutral
AMD,"Everyone is making assumptions based on their local pricing like I did. For twice the price you could get a 3070 here, the 3060 is about 50% more at 220$ compared to the 2060.",Neutral

AMD,Oh yeah u are right i looked it up so i will try a 3060 with a 5 5600 thats should be much better?,Positive
AMD,"The 3600 is a great chip, I used it since it came out a long ass time ago.  That said it is definitely old.  The price difference between Zen 2 and Zen 3 on Amazon is close to $40 and that would be worth it.  Otherwise you might be upgrading again in a year.",Positive

AMD,Bought a B650M-HDV/M.2 and it has been nothing but annoying since. I've never considered changing only the board before but honestly thinking about it. Even this new bios didn't boot first try. I had to tweak some memory options like the previous bios.  No one else I know who uses an amd cpu & gpu has had this much trouble.

He answered; ""No, I'm not really familiar with crypto mining."" 😵‍💫  Edit: fun fact since you mentioned it's turning 7 years old. I also paired it to a AMD 3900x to have a 7nm pc build. Totally unimportant, I know.",Positive
AMD,I have been with AMD for a very long time. I still have a dual core amd running with an x1800 amd gpu from I think mid 2000s. 3 Parts I did not want to get is the vega 56/64 and the Radeon 7. Just back then Nvidia had better choices for cheaper. HBM2 was way overpriced back then. Not sure about now though but I am guessing it is still way more than ddr.,Neutral
AMD,sarcasm?,Neutral
AMD,Damn it actually still is!   RTX5090 has about half the FP64 compute of Radeon VII.  Vega really was a pro/datacenter architecture that got lost and somehow found its way to consumers.,Positive

AMD,"If we're talking longevity, it has aged very well into its niche. It was a beast for crypto mining at its peak, and still is a beast for LLMs today, because it's basically a MI50 that can also game. The street price is 200 USD today and it is the best 16GB card in that price range.  The HBM2 memory was worthless for gaming, but priceless for crypto and LLMs. Same goes for the 16GB VRAM; it was worthless back then, but you'd be hard pressed to find the RTX 2080 Ti's 11GB sufficient today. It was a shit flagship gaming card, but it was the best product the Radeon team had ever unintentionally conceived.",Positive

AMD,"vega was decent, high compute power meant it could do well in raytracing tasks (and other compute intensive ones) even though it had no accelerators, amd is essentially going back to gcn philosophy with udna, modern games use compute a lot more",Positive
AMD,"This is probably what 1st gen Vega should've been. 2Gbps HBM2 was late to market (Samsung and SK Hynix both had trouble) and Vega64 had to make do with overclocked 945MHz (1.89Gbps) Samsung-only modules at a much higher 1.35v (vs 1.2v).  Funny seeing where HBM is now though. SK Hynix and AMD collaborated on the very first iteration of HBM for Fiji XT, as AMD wanted a memory better suited to the high bandwidth needs of GPUs. How forward-looking that was, right? HBM is all-in on AI/ML GPUs now.",Neutral

AMD,I think the issue more is that amds marketing is pretty disingenuous as to what the card is. Back when it released it would outperform rtx2080 but only in workstation centric applications making the use case pretty clear,Negative
AMD,"In my memory, the RVII couldn't keep up with the 1080ti (RVII was roughly equal to a 1080 when it launched), and that is backed up on notebookcheck comparison of the VII and the 1080ti showing a gaming-benchmark spread of +4to15% going to the 1080ti.  Maybe I am remembering that after an overclock it would outperform the 1080ti, but the 1080ti was an absolute monster, trading blows with the 2080 (or very close) even in many games.  AMD was in a rough spot then.  Well, its a spot they keep getting in really, Nvidia releases an insane card and AMD flops an upper-midrange response.

The 1080 Ti was nearly **30%** faster than a regular GTX 1080 and the Radeon VII slotted in right behind it at about 20-22% faster than a 1080 (\~24% faster than Vega 64). With the power budget pressure coming off from lower core and junction temps, combined with any \~1850MHz or higher positive offset curve you should be smack on the 1080 Ti and RTX 2080 performance with more still to gain assuming junction temps are kept under 90C.  As an interesting aside; AMD's decision with Fiji and Vega to continue using Vec16 ALUs and Wave64 has meant the architectures have improved with modern game engines more than they have with modern drivers.

Whats interesting is one part of the reason for the upcoming UDNA was to make R&D and testing ROCm a much cheaper investment and allow for lower entry for basic training.   While I thought it was basically using RDNA across the whole stack, its actually melding RDNA and GCN together.   Furthermore companies like MS are trying to enable alternatives to Nvidia/CUDAs high introductory price while minimizing customer time to experiment by creating translation layers to translate CUDA calls to ROCm, and allegedly with great success thus far.

The marketing team clearly dropped the ball, and that’s the real reason the package size has ballooned! Just unzip the driver package yourself and take a look",Negative
AMD,"Hopefully they have fixed the UI being extremely slow and buggy until you install/add a game. Minor inconvenience and fixed once you do that, but, still needed to be addressed.   I also really hope to see ‘Added HDR10+ Gaming’ support at some point as it’s just unacceptable that AMD are the only ones who don’t support it. Even Intel with their small user base do.",Negative

AMD,It's caused by nvidia's proprietary SHARC.   Seems like another one of their deliberate sabotages of AMD.

AMD,Did you do any other tuning like OC/UV? Do you have a card with dual BIOS?,Neutral

AMD,"just amd things , use Dx11 and your hopefully having less crashing issues.  its known for wow since like 5 years , and sporadic for like 12 with wow and amd.",Neutral
AMD,"Pretty convinced this is more of a wow/windows issue then an actual driver issue. I can be on the same driver for months with no problems then they drop a wow patch or a windows update and all of a sudden the issue comes back. It has been an issue on and off since I got my 7900XTX at launch and I have thousands of hours in wow since that time. I went deep down the rabbit hole trying to find a solution but there are none that stick. When it gets bad I turn off ray tracing and that seems to reduce how often they occur but not stop them completely.  There are also people more recently having the same/similar problem on Nvidia cards too, so its not specific to brand anymore it seems.",Negative
AMD,Not one crash on wow for me,Neutral
AMD,"do you have any OCs on your Card, CPU or RAM?   It did work fine with my 7900XTX, doesn't mean it's not an AMD problem just checking :)   OC Stuff can sometimes work well in 99 games and crash on the 100th",Positive
AMD,Exactly.,Neutral
AMD,"Because the developers are lying about the game using FSR 3.1. In reality, it's FSR 3.0, which is built into the game engine, without the separate DLL files that AMD provided several years ago. Therefore, it's impossible to enable FSR4 in the game because the driver doesn't recognize the DLL files, which need to be overridden. It's completely absurd that the developers released a game in this state in 2026",Negative

AMD,"Yes because fixing things is as easy to saying to a developer ""fix it"" and 5 minutes later he's done.",Neutral
AMD,They post the known issues so that people don't keep sending them reports about the same thing constantly. They will be working on a fix which can take time.,Neutral
AMD,The Nioh 3 devs are to blame for not implementing FSR3.1 properly. There is no external dll (amd\_fidelityfx\_dx12.dll) in the game directory so Adrenalin cannot hook into it to upgrade to FSR4.,Negative

AMD,Weird lighting issue. Looks like a checkerboard. Others have been having the same issue.,Negative
AMD,"I don't see any value in this software for my setup. It constantly hogs 200-300MB of VRAM in the background while offering zero interesting features, at least for the RX 7700 XT. The voltage tuning is a joke — it resets every time the driver crashes, regardless of whether the crash was caused by the app itself or unstable CPU/RAM overclocking.  Features like AFMF or Sharpening? Optiscaler does a much better job, plus it's a must-have for FSR4 in certain titles. The Hyper-RX/Quality/Power Saving profiles are pure cringe, and I'd throw Radeon Boost, Chill, and Anti-Lag into the same garbage bin. On top of that, I’ve been soft-locked several times trying to open the overlay with Alt+R; the app intercepts the input but fails to launch, freezing my cursor and forcing a hard reboot.",Negative
AMD,"Honestly, driver only works waay better for me, amd 7900xtx and rx 5 7600. With the software in any game(i mean mostly heavy games like rdr2 and returnal in 1440p) i get drops like 5-10fps, which doesn't seem a lot, but i feel it, playing at mostly high settings.",Positive

AMD,No?,Neutral
AMD,"there were like so many points and lines in the night raids or electromagnetic storms, was very weird.",Negative
AMD,"If you are on a 4k display then you can use optiscaler to render at a custom resolution i.e instead of fsr4 performance mode which renders at 1080p, you can change it to render slightly lower like 960p or 847p ect. It still looks better than playing at 1440p Quality/balance mode. Combine with using RIS2 and a slight overclock, the performance is not bad at all.  You could also just use fsr4 performance mode at 3200x1800, overall better experience than playing at native 1440p.  Path tracing even without any additional help from NRC, Ray regeneration and the help of the devs optimisation is still a viable option on the 9070xt.  There are some good resolutions in-between 1440p and 2160p to explore.",Positive
AMD,"There's also a PT mod called ultra plus or something, I think it reduces the light bounces (image looks almost the same)  Mod could push the game above 60fps",Positive
AMD,"1440p with FSR 4 balanced on a 9070xt is very playable, especially on a controller. You can even drop to FSR 4 performance mode and it's still okay, although it starts to get a bit more shimmery.",Positive

AMD,What's your frame rate? 15? Lol jk.. my 7800 sapphire nitro overclocked heavy still struggles with path tracing on CP and fsr,Neutral
AMD,This game is broken. My thoughts about this - after reinstalling drivers you have two Hogwarts Legacy folders in app data with compiled shaders and the game just cannot solve it so it crushes.   Just delete those folders manually and the game will compile shaders again as it should from the beginning.,Negative
AMD,"I don't think it was done on purpose. It's just unfortunate that a certain feature is clashing with how rdna4 handles path tracing. I tried cyberpunk path tracing on my 7800xt previously numerous times and didn't get any crashes, the only issue was a lack of performance.   This fix looks like it has to come from the developers side. And we know their priority is for Nvidia.",Negative
AMD,"tbf Nvidia sabotaging AMD is very likely, wouldn't be the first time.   But it's also very likely AMD just doesn't have or want to spend the ressources to get that resolved, lol.   As far as I read in this thread AMD still has issues with Warhammer 40k Darktide although the devs have contacted them a year ago.",Negative
AMD,"I just got the card recently so I haven't done too much tuning yet. Unfortunately it doesn't have a dual BIOS (RX 9070 Challenger).

AMD,"It may very well be a wow problem, but when it occurs in games using completely different engines, I feel it's more of a driver issue.  I don't play WoW with raytracing, even then, I tried many different option types and the crashes still happen.   I've come to the conclusion some time ago that I can't fix it and I just have to live with random crashes until either Blizzard or AMD does something.",Negative
AMD,"It crashes regardless of OC or not, my buddy with a 7800XT gets the same errors and it doesn't matter whether it's Retail or Classic WoW or whether it's directX11 or 12, low or highest setting. Unfortunately I don't ever think I will get a fix, despite reporting the error everytime.  The problem is that it's so random. I can play regularly for a month+ no problem and sometimes it crashes 3 times within an hour. Never saw it crash 4 times, yet anyway...  Only OC I have is my RAM @ 6000Mhz, but my friend has no and runs on default speed.   As said, only problem is WoW and Endfield(in some areas of the game, not all).",Negative

AMD,At least nVidia has cleaned them up.  AMD's drivers just keep getting worse.,Negative
AMD,"Not true , my GF got a 3070 and installed EVERY SINGLE update.  No issues infact her performance slightly improved in certain games and got giant DLSS upgrades.  Meanwhile the 6800XT i have is my first amd GPU in like 10 years and i have DDU permanently on my PC because the driver randomly breaks in some way and i need to DDU to get it back to normal.  Like right now the amd interface wont autostart anymore ( i added it to the startup folder for now cause i dont want to DDU AGAIN )     if the memory craze wouldnt be here i would have bought THIS MONTH a 5070TI for me and my wife.",Positive
AMD,"I bought the amd 6xxx series for my two pcs but before that, I had Nvidia, and I never had issues with nvidia drivers.   Amd has always given me issues at some point when I bought em.  Had an hd 7870 that had some issue with final fantasy XIV, which was and is my main game.   The game kept crashing, so I thought the card was bad, so I rma for another card. New card same issue. So I just tell em send me whatever the equivalent Nvidia card you have. I got a 660ti, and it just worked.  Bought myself a 770 and 980ti, which both worked no issues.  The computer died right as I moved for a new job, so I just needed something cheap, so I bought an Rx580, and while it was mostly fine, it still had a few crashes.  The 3060 I got later had zero issues.  I have s 6800xt and a 6900xt and im on some older driver (like maybe 2 or 3 drivers ago) because when I update (full clean with DDU and all), i get crashes when I game.

There's DeepFilterNet but it hasn't really been updated in years though there's been a lot of claims of progress of DeepFilterNet3 with I'm assuming private branches.

AMD,What does that have to do with AMD drivers?,Neutral
AMD,"I'm sorry to say, but this isn't normal behavior. It absolutely should not happen, and it screams hardware defect to me. If this keeps happening on older drivers, then I'd RMA the card entirely - sign of bad silicone!",Negative
AMD,"As usual, I have to use Optiscaler. If it weren't for the developers of this mod, AMD would be even more screwed than it is now. I use it in this game and I have no problems. The crash occurs when using frame generation via Optiscaler; the game simply won't launch until you remove the mod. Otherwise, everything works fine",Negative
AMD,"Ehm, haven't they always provided a combined one since driver branching started? The issue here is the lack of the separated packages. Sometimes though you had to hunt a bit for one or the other...",Neutral
AMD,Or maybe theyre issues amd cant fix like cyberpunk being a literal nvidia feature causing the problem,Negative
AMD,they have 300 billion dollar cap they dont have excuse except they want shareholder value,Negative
AMD,It shows as fsr3.1 in the game menu but it might be fsr3.0 and the idiots labelled it wrong. Not sure if there is way to identify the version.,Negative

AMD,its just amd fan people that didnt had a nvidia gpu the last 10 years so they literally dont know that you dont experience all the issues you do on amd and just think what they read here is true that they have the same issues.,Negative
AMD,Nvidia cant make a driver that doesnt shit itself whenever windows updates so,Negative
AMD,"No thanks, I play games that don't work on Linux (yes Kernel lvl anti cheat)   Also, I'm a software dev for windows applications.   And also, what does switching to linux have to do with the whole topic?  And I need FSR 4 Because FSR 3 looks significantly worse then even XESS on it's fallback mode a lot of the times and even the 7900XTX needs upscaling for pretty much any RT game, and no I am not turning down settings on a 1200€ GPU (when I bought it)",Negative
AMD,"Yeah that sucks :c but the bonus RT performance, the WAAAAAY better upscaler + the fact that most of these software features get actually used in games, still keeps me happy",Positive
AMD,until AMD says something about it officially its pointless asking about it at every driver release.  So instead of wasting your own time focus on the driver drop what it fixes and if you have games that need support.  I'm an RDNA 3 users aswell and I don't see the point asking for this every driver release they will or will not do it just let it be.,Negative
AMD,"Nah, the problem is with 4000 and 5000 gen, check forums, they have problems with 1 year without solution (like the recent problem with hdmi that amd fixes in the next drivers), i think it's maybe because of all the new features with the app, DLSS, FG, MFG, and so...",Negative

AMD,This was actually introduces like Half a year or year ago and STILL is a thing.  Press the 3 dots next to the driver in the manager.     Man if people would stop spreading false stuff like facts.,Negative
AMD,"From the human eye, there's no visual difference. I also would be pretty confused if the visuals degraded but the performance did not at least increase.  Its like if I enable dlss ultra quality and degrade the visuals but keep the performance of DLAA, it wouldn't make much sense.",Neutral
AMD,"No. Optiscaler is not missing anything to make PT/RT stable. I think you are getting confused when dlss inputs are used and PT is enabled, Ray reconstruction is automatically enabled which doesn't work on AMD gpus, so the denoising looks grainy or not 100% rendered, which then boost performance. When xess/fsr inputs are used then Ray reconstruction is disabled, therefore only the in-game denoiser is being used and everything is rendered properly.  Optiscaler doesn't make PT anymore stable or less stable. Optiscaler produces overall better quality visuals than the in-game fsr4, because it uses the correct fsr 4 models for each quality settings. but that's it.   Disabling sharc doesn't boost performance on my 9070xt and doesn't change anything visually.",Neutral
AMD,This issue has been fixed for me by first using ddu to uninstall my driver and then updating to 26.2.1,Neutral
AMD,Steam machine? Hello?  And antilag still doesnt disprove my point?  Stay on topic,Negative
AMD,"Radeon VII does, but any generation of GCN should be completely out of the picture.  Navi 10 doesn't, yet Navi 14 does, then all of RDNA2+. AMD likely ran out of time before tapeout for Navi 10, as Sony needed the silicon finalized to set their semi-custom chip up. Doesn't make sense that a lower tier Navi GPU has DP4a otherwise.",Neutral

AMD,"Only volumetric clouds at night with ""Effect"" setting higher than ""Medium"" were affected. Rest of the sky was fine.",Neutral
AMD,"Optiscaler is just an overall great tool to have, just like afterburner, Lossless ect. I had it even when I was using my 7800xt,7600.   Play around with the custom  resolutions/ Upscale ratio override as well.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah, I don't think it'll happen either. The only way that happens is if the OptiScaler guys find a way to inject Ray Regeneration into the game.",Negative
AMD,"To be fair, the 9070xt is a 1440p card, not a 4K one",Neutral
AMD,- you lunch game  - game crushes video driver  *I think my motherboard is broken* /s  Also I have found that other people had the same issue with Radeon cards.   I forgot that Steam had this community board and maybe I will find more info there and it was more info and solution.   It looked like a GPU driver problem. Like I had with Helldivers and Forza Motorsport before (both were fixed by driver update),Negative
AMD,He said that doing a driver-only install gets rid of the problem.,Neutral
AMD,"Looked into it now and apparently using Xess inputs it's fine (I can confirm, started using it and played for an hour with no crashes).. the reason I went with AMD on my upgrade is because OptiScaler exists, absolute god send.",Positive
AMD,My mistake I just realized I was referring to my desktop My framework is all already in A3 on both the APU and discreet GPU. My desktop has an RDNA 2 IGPU which I do use in some workloads and a discreet RDNA 3 GPU The annoying thing though when I used DDU of my desktop it uninstalls both drivers and when they're not in a combined driver I end up with a APU that is running the Microsoft basic display adapter driver. I like to have both working troubleshooting purposes and also just in case if I ever need a fifth monitor or need to use hybrid display mode for light if my power is out and running on a generator.,Neutral
AMD,"why would they say ""we are working on it"" if they can't do anything about it?   Yes, this problem IS caused by Nvidia.   But AMD says ""AMD is actively working on a resolution with the developer to be released as soon as possible. ""   For several month so either they are lying about working on it, or they are not able to fix this, idk what about this is true, but they can't constantly post that and expect people not to blame them lol.",Negative
AMD,"I know theres a registry edit to show the exact dlss version but it seems like it doesnt work for fsr, but what about optiscaler, usually it shows the inputs version",Negative
AMD,this sounds funny because AMD had to lock clean install for a year on their driver installation because it could brick w11 lmao,Negative
AMD,Yea they just dont work when updating their own drivers from my experience.,Negative
AMD,"as an owner of every generation of nvidia gpu.... it's hilarious that people think that nvidia's gpus are never without issue, historically having the highest rate of issues AND catastrophically so that has require nvidia to pull them entirely.

AMD,"If you switched to Linux or dual booted with Windows as your 2nd option (the distribution being CachyOS, for example) you'd get access to their modified Steam Proton version that has an FSR 3.1 upgrade function (the one 9000 series GPUs utilize for FSR 4 support), except it's  for RDNA 3 as well.   Most invasive kernel-level anticheat games either don't support FSR 3.1 anyway or they don't need upscaling at all, since they're e-sports optimized games (also why are you allowing ring zero access to third party corpos?). The rest will work perfectly, which is about 95% of FSR 4 supported titles.   And yes, I agree that FSR 3 obviously looks much worse since it doesn't have any intelligent upscaling, just algorithmic voodoo stuff. But for native AA it's perfectly enough, from my own testing. For RT upscaling, though - tough luck. Only Linux or Optiscaler will help.",Neutral

AMD,> Steam machine? Hello?  I'm going to point you to the fact that any of the software improvements the steam deck brought about have been open to everyone on other hardware and distros.

AMD,I'm playing 4k cyberpunk at steady 60fps with some RT on and mostly high settings,Neutral
AMD,"Because if amd could do it, it would be done by now. Amd can only do so much when its the actual game that needs tweaking. Working on it is them telling cdpr what to fix and cdpr needing to fix it",Neutral
AMD,Optiscaler doesn't detect the fsr input so cannot get any info. It's very likely it's fsr3.0 built into the game code. It's sad that devs are still using deprecated versions when fsr3.1 is available.,Negative

So "" Awesome nvidia thanks for fixing windows bugs "" would be correct  also it was literally in **2 days**.  how long does amd take to fix the issues ? years ? if ever?",Negative
AMD,"Nvidia themselves acknowledge it, so nobody is saying you are lying, but if the creator of your GPU is acknowledging a windows problem, then I wouldn't dismiss it just because you personally haven't had any issues allegedly.

AMD,This entire situation with FSR4 and my 7900xtx.  Has solidified my thoughts that I will buy Nvidia next time I upgrade.,Neutral
AMD,"AMD had so much goodwill with the 7xxx series and the pricing of the 9xxxx series. IDK why they’re shooting themselves in the foot with gate keeping FSR 4. If it’s less performant on older cards, who gives a shit, just give people the option. That’s what Nvidia did with the newest DLSS and everyone liked it",Negative
AMD,"Certainly this year with its ridiculous high prices would be a massive show of good will to AMD fans.   Hopefully Valve is pushing on them at a higher level as it would greatly help Machine that is on RDNA 3, this also could be a reason to have not released yet as Valve has worked very closely with AMD and with their push to Linux OS and by extension AMD hardware... so maybe they are releasing Int8 with Machine to show solidarity with Valve?",Positive
AMD,"FSR4 is much slower than previous versions, especially without full hardware acceleration. Upscaling tech is literally only for squeezing higher framerates out of cards. Although I understand wanting features supported on old cards, porting FSR4 to older hardware is unlikely to achieve the one thing it needs to do; allow the card to render games at acceptable framerates by upscaling.",Negative
AMD,So where can we snag that DLL?,Neutral
AMD,"Pressure them, to release this... also pretty sure they don't care until they are selling all to AI.",Negative
AMD,"Haven't watched the video, but in AMD's defense. Smaller native floating point makes such a big difference in performance, quality and such a different beast to tune that it doesn't really make sense for AMD to invest in FSR yet.  FSR4 requires FP8, which is only natively supported by RDNA4. Nvidia already showed that FP4 gives you double the ai performance for visually the same quality as FP8. From a technical stance, the a lot of work the software radeon team will have to tune FP8 FSR4 will have to be redone whenever Radeon supports FP4 natively.  While it sucks that we don't get FSR4 on rdna 2 or 3, AMD themselves aren't willing to place a dead-end int8 version under the same label as their current stepping stone. Integer and floating point are different enough that optimizations in 1 don't translate to the other a lot of the time.  They also have to communicate with the hardware team to decide what is and isn't a viable development route. Tensor cores are essential for running transformer based upscaling. The hardware team not developing tensor cores held radeon back from developing transformer based FSR (FSR4) sooner. While Nvidia put tensor cores in their gpus since 2018 RTX. AMD only started with 2025 RDNA4, so AMD is playing 7 years of catch up. Even the first Intel Arc cards from 2022 had tensor cores.",Neutral
AMD,"I have been buying AMD at release for the last 20 years, my last 3 GPUs were an R390, an RX480, a 5700 and my current GPU is is the 7900 xt and its a similar situation with CPUs since the first ryzen generations to now the 9800x3d. I am never buying AMD ever again! This is the kind of practices why I haven't been buying Nvidea or Intel, locking out features that we all know are possible on hardware that is one generation behind instead of at least introducing it as an experimental feature or part of beta driver shows how much this company that was relatively consumer friendly went from you can flash a higher tier or even next gen GPU bios and keep the same Mobo platform with AM4 from 1700x to 5800x3d to the same anti consumer crap the other teams are doing, and since the other teams have better features and support AMD lost the one reason why I keep coming back to them. Never again!",Negative
AMD,I would buy a 9070 XT only if AMD would release FSR4 for my 7700XT.,Neutral
AMD,"It is probably because FSR 4 upscaling is worse on older models since they lack the AI cores to run it right. AMD is probably worried about people using the 7000 series cards in comparison videos.  You can see the Int8 version is a lot softer and lacks a lot of the sharpness and detail you get in the FP8 version. HUB also didn't include FPS numbers. I suspect the performance hit is notable.  Not a very smart move, but can I see why they might do it.",Negative
AMD,"I think the problem is that, the INT8 version of FSR4 is technically worse than the FP8 version, AMD can't release the INT8 version legally (otherwise that would be classified as false advertising).  They should either call it FSR 3.9 or something, or just make it open source permanently",Negative
AMD,It's not exclusive to just AMD. Nvidia and even Intel are bugging out and selling higher. They are only aiming at the high VRAM units because they can't supply that unit until the market levels off. Any other company that had plans is now probably going to spend the next two years waiting on AI to make a profit before they shell out a new model and more than likely they are going to cater to the budget market because the market will be flooded with memory wafers.,Neutral
AMD,this green shill again....,Negative
AMD,so much repost spam of this,Negative
AMD,"I think Tim is missing the point a little here. AMD has opted (finally, and rightfully) to follow Nvidias example where it comes to their perception in the market.   Let me elaborate. Nvidia releases a software feature that doesn't work on the previous generation of GPU’s. Why do they do this? Is it because it simply wouldn’t work? Or because they just want to screw their customers with older cards? Or because they want to encourage sales of the new GPU? Maybe all 3, who knows.   But one reason that I find is often overlooked is that Nvidia knows and cares tremendously about brand perception. They learned that with the first version of DLSS. They were a laughing stock for a year because of how shit it was.  So Nvidia will not put out software for GPU’s unless it meets a certain quality standard. Now look at DLSS. The brand perception is so well regarded because they lock it down to only the cards it works well on.  To circle back, I think this is exactly what AMD has finally learned. They've been dogged and trashed for years because of their shoddy software features, and now they’re taking a page out of Nvidias book.   Yes Int8 FSR 4 could work on older cards, but it would muddy the waters of brand perception. RDNA3 and RDNA2 users would think it’s ok, whereas RDNA4 users would have a much better experience. Thus leading to inconsistent messaging from users, and the word of mouth effect is dramatically weakened.",Negative

AMD,"Not sure to be honest. vkd3d-proton doesn't officially support FSR4 on non-RDNA4 cards yet. The dev a while back said   \> This decision is above my paygrade and it's done to work toward being able to support FSR4 more officially in Proton.  Seems like AMD is blocking them from making it available for older cards for at least the official proton builds. Community proton versions like ProtonGE offers FSR4 for RDNA3 with an easy launch arg, but no such thing is possible yet for rdna2 where you still need to swap dlls.",Negative
AMD,AMD forced Valve into not bundling FSR4 support for RDNA3 with Proton…,Neutral
AMD,"I actually love valve's argument. They got the 8gb vram from their survey. 1mil people can use 1060 6gb and it can be at the top but it does not make it a good product. I can see the steam machine being overpriced and struggeling in new games.  I personally never ran into a vram limitation but I do not play a lot of newer games.

Why not just add an ""experimental FSR 4"" flag to the driver, pop up a warning about lower performance, and call it a day?

AMD,"2ms frametime cost to generate a 1440p image in quality mode in Oblivion Remastered on my setup using Linux.  For a lot of the HW that's out there, INT8 makes a lot of sense, since RDNA2 and up have 4x the INT8 throughput compared to INT32. FP8 would need RDNA3 or later to run somewhat performantly.  Thing is, the INT8 version doesn't really need to be better than the FP8 version. It already completely outclasses FSR3 + XeSS and comes close to FP8 - this is definitely good enough. AI cores aren't required on a technical level to reach better image quality btw., so who says that the INT8 version can't be improved upon?  IMO AMD should call it ""FSR4 Lite"" and release it already as-is.",Neutral

AMD,"Yeah AMD really dropped the ball by not including the hardware for AI upscaling and strong raytracing from the beginning. So now they're in a fucked if they do, fucked if they dont situation. Obviously here in the AMD subreddit, there is a personal bias towards releasing FSR4 on older cards even if its not optimal to run the model on 6 and 7 series, and I get that considering the cards are not even 5 years old. But everywhere else they would get ridiculed for having shitty software, and people would use it as an excuse to not buy AMD. They've been trying to shake off the shitty drivers reputation for so long now but can't, even when now their drivers are completely fine (at least for me on RX480, Vega 64, and 6950XT). And even Nvidia isn't clear from driver issues either. Its just the nature when there are thousands of combinations of GPUs, CPUs, monitors, and applications to run.

Worried it'll be way more demanding in the future but hoping not because the current level of graphics are already insane to me.  For reselling I think it'll fare better than the 5060 Ti 16GB and the 5070 12GB because it has the performance and the VRAM but we will see what the next gen is capable of. Maybe it's way more power efficient and/or better in performance like the leap from 2000 series to 3000 series. We don't know. Maybe 6060 Ti will be near in performance but with better Upscaling and Frame Gen capability? Maybe not.  Upscaling and Frame Gen is here to stay and the improvements have been insane so I think the card's capability to use it properly will also be considered.  Maybe NVIDIA pulls another DLSS 4.5 level of quality increase in some way or magically improves latency that can only be utilized by the next gen.",Neutral

AMD,"Ur talking about vram, man those cards arent even coming out anymore",Negative
AMD,"Bruh, people got so pissed at NVIDIA for the pricing of the 4xxxx series and fake frames. There was a massive push on Reddit and the tech media to go AMD. This is what led Linus to use a 7900 XTX over a 5090 in his updated personal system.   Then after the 9xxxx series launched, they were initially undercutting NVIDIA by ~$150-200 dollars. This was temporarily unavailable, but as recently as December you could get a 9070 xt for under MSRP, while most every 5070ti/5080 was slightly over MSRP and a way worse value. This led to pretty much every Redditor glazing the 9xxxx series, but AMD now seems hell bent on overturning all the goodwill.",Negative

AMD,Exactly my point I worked for that company and I'm not sure why other people spout these nonsense. FSR4 was able to run RDNA3 and older but they wanted to force consumers to buy their latest gen products. Such scummy behaviour from a company really there is no defending this.,Negative
AMD,"They don't have a say in its release, however AMD is codeveloping their hardware and especially their software with Sony. This is what Project Amethyst is.      It's the same way that the PS4 Pro shipped with hardware/software that Vega eventually used (rapid packed math)",Neutral
AMD,"if you havent known, sony tv has best video post processing and upscaling in tv market.   meanwhile, amd fully in house fsr3 upscaling is horrible.  so it is possible that most of fsr4 technical contribution comes from sony.   hence sony might have legal rights in approving fsr4 releases.",Negative

Why drag all this speculation and negative PR out? It is possible they're hamstrung by Sony.

AMD,"This isn't really true though, not even at 1080p for some games. UE5 games all require upscaling to hit decent performance. Being stuck with a 7900XTX just means you'll get an uglier game than someone with a 9070XT or Nvidia card.  Like in theory a 7900XTX is roughly equal to a 9070XT/4080/5070Ti if they run the exact same settings but in practice it's really not because you can run much lower resolutions on those cards and still get better visual results. I'd say that in hindsight picking a 7900XTX over a 4080 was a bad choice. Very similar to the 5700XT vs 2070S situation. Those cards feel very much like a stopgap.",Negative
AMD,"1080ti launched 10 months after the regular 10 series and the Titan Xp, 1.5 years is a normal amount of time, the 1080ti was still shoulder to shoulder with the 2080 for a similar price and the 2080ti was much more expensive",Neutral

It’s the same as a Super edition in Nvidia cards, a bit more of everything meant to lure in late adopters, it’s not supposed to be an upgrade path from the 9800x3d.   No idea about the mobile range   “The same CPUs” are generally failed higher SCU products, everyone does this. Perfect example is memory that doesn’t hit certain markers gets sold as a lesser SKU (3200mhz vs 3600mhz DDR4); they don’t just throw away the product. Intel also does this, as do Nvidia.   No idea about APUs, but a perhaps poorly named product isn’t “snatching defeat” either. Their APUs are in the 3 main consoles which sounds like they’re winning there too.",Negative
AMD,"APUs lack PCIe lanes because analog PCIe PHYs are actually quite large and there are set die sizes and transistor budgets to meet. The iGPU also takes the equivalent of x16 lanes (IF isn't 1:1, but it's close to this amount) for memory and IO access. Infinity Fabric is data protocol agnostic, so iGPU can use internal lanes without needing any of those large, analog PHYs and can report as a standard PCI bus.",Neutral

AMD,"If you haven't known, all TV processing is fucking awful and works on completely different principles than real time processing. Especially when it comes to upscaling.",Negative
AMD,Optiscaler is for injecting FSR into games that only support Nvidia and Intel solutions for upscaling or that don't support FSR 3.1. So they can't be moved up to FSR redstone/4. It injects FSR 4 in place of dlss or xess instead.,Neutral
AMD,"I did not call Project Amethyst an FSR backport, I said I don't think we will see any  information about FSR4 being backported, until after Project Amethyst launches.   I believe the Viola GPU in the PS5 Pro is a unique custom blend of RDNA 2, RDNA 3 and RDNA 4 features, that pretty much requires it's own custom upscaler for best performance.

AMD,">If they have no intentions whatsoever of doing it, why not rip the band-aid off, declare it's not happening in no uncertain terms, and just get it over with?  Well, traditionally, AMD has always blundered their PR harder than anyone else, and this time probably doesn't want people to just wait for the next APUs that feature FSR 4 because their newest chips are still on RDNA 3.5 or whatever.  Essentially, they're still shipping older architecture without modern FSR support and want people to keep buying it. If they said it was DOA, nobody would buy into it.",Negative
AMD,"As the owner of a laptop with a 6850m XT in it, my sad suspicion is that when AMD announced they were separating the driver development for RDNA 3 & 4 from the driver development for RDNA 1 & 2, and then had that whole kerfuffle ""maintenance mode""  which they then corrected to, RDNA 1 & 2 continuing to receive new game support. What it was really about is that AMD is only planning on bringing the INT8 version of FSR4 to RDNA 3 and 3.5 based products and that the 6000 series GPU's are going to be left out in the cold.   I think Sony getting first crack at it has a lot more to do with the fact that they helped jointly create the code to run FS4 on older GPU's than the volume of SoC's they buy from AMD for their PlayStation division.

AMD,"Downsampling is objectively the right thing. What market comparisons with native + TAA neglect is that sharpness is meaningless without a ground truth.

Unless Radeon starts being forward thinking I'd argue the whole brand is falling into that category.   They're not innovating or even considering future tech. They're being dragged kicking and screaming into supporting things late, with no planning for the hardware or software support. Nvidia is now humiliating them on longer term support. Nvidia cards that launched before RDNA1 and the VII are better supported than some APUs and cards that have released in the last few years on AMD's side.   They can't do the Nvidia minus $50 model, while having worse long-term support and short-sighted planning. They shouldn't have even been blindsided on this tech direction.

AMD,"I dunno, I don't think PS5 Pro can do 300 TOPs in INT8. I calculated 144 TOPs at 2350MHz. It would be unusual for AMD to include full CDNA2 throughputs (1024 ops in INT8 per CU), as that would require more transistors per CU and an expensive redesign of GPU masks billed to Sony. Semi-custom only goes so far (off-the-shelf designs that can be mixed and matched). This would border on fully custom.  It is capable of 288 TOPs in INT4, so where high precision isn't needed, like traversing through the CNN, INT4 could be used. INT8 can be used for the final frame accumulation stage to reduce errors (which can simply combine 2 INT4 outputs at high/low sides to create an equivalent INT8 data type). If that's how they're doing INT8, then yes, it's near 300 TOPs and pretty damn clever (on top of their VGPRs as VRAM custom firmware; most of AMD's GPU logic can be reprogrammed via firmware).",Neutral
AMD,"Mark Cerny did say it has special acceleration cores for RT and PSSR upscaling. And Digital Foundry made comparison and came to the conclusion that the closest GPU is the 9060XT, hence my comment.",Neutral

AMD,"No shit Sherlock, it's not in the title though",Negative
AMD,"I never use upscaling for performance personally. I use upscaling in every possible game because actually running DLSS over native AA/TAA implementations looks literally better in virtually every title (at least from 1440p and up baseline, i think its a little worse from 1080p baseline). And its been like that easily since 3.x version.   On the other hand, theres almost no reason to not use DLSS 4.5 on quality vs native.",Neutral
AMD,I absolutely agree that AMD's lack of support for previous-gen products is unacceptable. But it's not a matter of the time commitment to watch the video. I'd gladly watch a 30-minute deep-dive on the topic by a creator who respects his or her audience by using descriptive titles.

If a game runs shit to look decent at 1440p on a 7900XTX, it's very likely not my GPUs fault but a incompetent studio unable to optimize.

Better off in terms of latency and smoothness using zero queue plus FG in any games that let you change it compared to queue 1 (god forbid if the default is 2 or 3 frames).

FSR Quality does keep it closer to 60fps but even then it still drops under.  It's not like the entire game runs like that but there are quite a few areas that do unfortunately, just is what it is. I mean I have to use DLSS Q with the 5090 to always stay above 60fps too, it's sad.",Negative

AMD,Ditto,Neutral
AMD,There playing with upscaling on and don’t even know it and not with ultra graphics settings. Heard ultra in UE5 games is a waste anyways,Negative
AMD,">Just them skipping a generation of high end cards and leaving me with no upgrade path was enough to get me back to Nvidia after 3 generations of AMD. And they've done nothing but vindicate that choice ever since.  So nvidia does it its ok, amd does it and youre mad? Very hypocritical",Neutral
AMD,"Still nonissue, fg is great",Positive
AMD,"I use a samsung g9 ultrawide 5k, pixel count is maybe 10% less than a 4k? Must make a bigger difference than I expected. For me only the gestral village had fps drops, and I think that was just some kind of bug.",Negative
AMD,Shadow of the tomb raider is 2018 game dude.  Why are you bringing it up ?,Negative
AMD,"Ultra is somewhat of a waste, but there's very little scaling in UE5 too so dropping it to high or medium only give you 20-40% extra performance. Not nearly enough to hit 60.  Them using upscaling without knowing could be a possible explanation.",Negative
AMD,"Two different guys you're arguing with. I'm the guy you're quoting but not the guy whose been replying after that.  I bought their products because they were competitive on Raster starting with the 5700xt and 6900xt and I could look past fsr and RT performance for a while longer on a 7900 xtx.  But I was not willing to grab a 9070xt just for finally tolerable fsr, and instead grabbed a 5090 for a real upgrade during the period where they could be had for near msrp.  I now have zero reason to ever go back to an amd gpu since they will always be behind the curve and it's unlikely that they'll actually put out a card that competes with the 5090 within the next 2 or 3 years.",Neutral
AMD,"Nvidia launched some new features that had little traction and no demand, that older hardware couldn't do.   AMD 5-6 years after DLSS2.0 launched decided MAYBE just maybe people do care about upscaling, while having a decent version be locked solely to their latest arch. Leaking a version that sort of works on older archs. And just a complete lack of forward thinking in RDNA2 and RDNA3's designs. They aren't innovating or pushing a new tech, they're catching up 6 years late to the party.",Negative

AMD,It's either gonna be really high or really low...,Neutral
AMD,it will be several years of AI cluster build out.   At least it will go on until share holders say enough.    The minute Elon  started talking about AI centers in space nearly everybody in the AI industry started working on similar projects.   The only thing that might save us is that the RAM might need to be rad hard.  Even then it might be cheaper to apply a bit of radiation shielding.      At a minimal we are talking 2+ years because new factories are required to address the shortages.   Frankly just the centers Elon has planed will keep the industry tight for ages.   Elon just had a published all hands meeting with X AI to recruit new employees.   The build out is just massive and these companies are working hard just to get employees.,Neutral
AMD,"But if they increase the cost of the Medusa Halo APU package, add the mandatory cost of LPDDR6, and end up grabbing the difference of a dGPU system, then it isn't a point worth considering in its favor.  Yeah, it's neat that the board/system can be smaller and that power delivery can be simplified because its going to a 3chiplet+SOW config (if MDH still uses SOW) instead of all over a board.  But in that case, it probably won't be saving any money.  Just like Strix Halo:  It isn't cheaper than its competition in any measurable way that counts, just simpler to design.  Don't get me wrong, I want these to succeed because it is a segment that could add a lot of value to gaming and whatnot.  But with machine learning ruining the OEM hardware market along with price increases for the sake of price increases, this might be a tough sale when Strix Halo has been so slow to sell and get widely adopted by OEMs outside of random mini-PCs and niche handhelds.",Negative
AMD,"Which is already the case with Strix Halo today. The end result is it is either not price competitive with iso-performance dGPUs, or not performance competitive with similarly priced dGPU laptops (5070Ti+).",Negative
AMD,"how is the most current apple cpu ""old hat""?  I don't think you know what that expression means",Neutral
AMD,"One also needs to consider the process node: Strix Halo is manufactured on a ""4 nm"" node, the M4 Pro at a ""3 nm"" node, Medusa Halo is assumed to be on a ""2 nm"" node. So I'd assume that power use under load isn't too bad for Medusa Halo; I expect it to be the same as Strix Halo, which would mean much petter power efficiency under load.  For idle/low load power consumption, I wonder how much is due to the CPU vs. the system design. The ZBook Ultra G1a on which I'm typing this is apparently using between 10W and 20W on low load (according to powertop). On high CPU load it is 57W.",Neutral
AMD,"Sure it requires more power than M4, but in comparison to other X86 technologies it is pretty impressive.   I'm looking at my old AMD box on an ATX board and suspect I could get a decent performance upgrade and much lower power usage but going to a Strix Halo mini PC.     Now I could go to Apples M5 units which are apparently ready to come out any day now and do much better on a performance per watt basis.    I don't game on either platform but do do CAD work and such and honestly the M1 MBA I have isn't bad in that context.    It is not great either but with these new processors I should be able to do much better.    The desktop has a dedicated GPU card but it is dated and frankly today's APU's probably put it to shame.    The biggest problem with Apples hardware is the lack of solid Linux support.",Positive
AMD,The differences in how memory is attached and accessed are part of the M-series' Secret Sauce. I am thinking that Halo processors were a testbed for several technologies that will hopefully come down in price if AMD can refine them. They're also finally paying TSMC for space on the bleeding-edge nodes and focusing on ways to lower the power consumption of their I/O.,Neutral
AMD,Elon be like do you even trip brooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!11111!!!,Neutral
AMD,"What makes you thing Strix Halo has been a hard sell?   Seriously I'm looking at this as the place to upgrade.  Beyond that AI is not ruining the OEM market, it is making available performance in AI workloads we would still be wishing for.   Those Mini Pc's with large memory allocations make for extremely good values.",Neutral
AMD,I don't think it's meant to be price competitive. It's meant for tackling AI and ML loads by assigning huge RAM to GPU which people can't do on their own.,Neutral
AMD,"Comically enough, with 128GB of RAM, Strix Halo for a brief moment (before all the desktop makers caught on and raised prices accordingly) actually became competitive.",Neutral
AMD,Thing is with this case today is that laptops with strix halo are very expensive and most of the time come with a better dGPU.,Neutral
AMD,M5 is the most current Apple processor.    It would be nice if it was in more machines.  Basically plaything older that 6 months is old hat as far as processors go.,Positive
AMD,"Sadly he has more money than I want to admit and can buy all the RAM he needs.  I'm actually happy about the possibility of really outstanding AI (if we ever get there) so I'm not knocking the build out.   Sadly, from the memory industry there has been a lot of resistance to building out more foundries due to the boom - bust cycles in the RAM industry.",Positive
AMD,"It has been a hard sell in the USA referenced by the fact that there are so few products that use the chip.  It's a year old at this point, maybe even longer then that!  It should be in many different laptop configs now, but it's essentially in an Asus tablet device, an HP laptop, and now soon, a laptop from Lenovo.  I think Framework is releasing something using STH.      Beyond that, it's only in boutique mini PCs and a few handhelds gaming devices really, and it took relatively forever to get there because it costs a lot AND needs expensive memory to hit it's bandwidth needs.  So MDH will probably be slower to adopt, especially considering the increase in price per wafer of the newer tsmc process node.      Machine learning is ruining the OEM market.  The dram crunch is tightening everything it touches, which is a lot (memory, storage, GPU, and more).  Processor technology is neat, but the fact of the matter is, machine learning is still incredibly infrequently used on home devices outside of browser based queries, so I don't think that adds anything of value to probably 95% or more of home PC users.",Negative

Its not that I dont want quirky tech, I love that shit. I just think the GPU market has gone all for flash and gimmicks instead of substance.

I think the next generation of GPUs is going to be a very very very ugly bloodbath in many astounding ways.  I almost miss 2017/18 when you could go get a Fury or GTX 1070-1080ti (I still have mine) without worry.",Negative
AMD,What substance could they (the partners) realistically provide?,Neutral
AMD,"Well if prices and supply wasn't so fucked as it is now, I personally enjoyed the different form factors that they would do. Like the wide but short 1-fan options to make small form factor builds. China still has a few of these options. Also AMD and Nvidia would put up the cost of designing the chip and board specifications, and the partners would make the coolers. So often times you'd get both better and cheaper options from partners because of this deal. Aside from that, these days theres not much else they can do. OC models have not made any difference for a long long time. So unfortunately unless this market fixes itself (which I highly doubt it will ever go back to how it was even 10 years ago), we will see a lot of board partners exit the scene just like EVGA.",Positive

It took forever for people to finally realize Intel was feeding them the same slop year after year as well.  With that said, professionality is important. The wording of their statements matter.

AMD,I don’t think the yields are this low.       2nm had a 90% yield rate in july 2025.

AMD,>legitimate anti-monopolistic tactics  Illegitimate monopolistic tactics?,Neutral
AMD,"You have it backwards, ARM = cloud hyperscale except where AMD is trying to make/maintain inroads with Zen5c. AI is mostly being ran on x86 because ARM isn't quite as fast as x86 for low latency stuff eg whenever the CPU becomes a bottleneck in an AI farm you want x86 so your GPU idle time is minimal. The reason AMD is at 40% revenue share is because they are selling CPUs for a large margin... something ARM vendors cannot do.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep, Dell literally had to be forced by it's customers to offer AMD and they are huge.

AMD,"I am certain they are solid. My gpu is certainly not liquid or gas, hence it is solid.  You deserve the troll. No fr, their gou's work perfectly fine. Plug and play experience. They really upped their game on upscaling, but still lack support in games (and older architectures).   If you complain about software issues, many programs are not optimized for amd gpu's, hence they may perform worse. But haven't encountered a single case where it didn't work at all. And I do degenerate stuff.",Positive
AMD,Intel messed up with stagnation long before the 13th and 14th generation. Just remember the 14nm process that started during the 5th gen (2014) and lasted up until the 11th gen (2021). This gave more than enough time for AMD to catch up and surpass them.,Neutral
AMD,"> In the meantime amd released a generarion with basically zero gains and they increased prices due to their growing reputation.  Idk if this is really a fair characterization. Zen 5 has good gains but moreso in professional apps and the data center vs consumer desktop. Zen 5 has proper avx-512 vs doubled up 256 on zen-4. There's more L1 cache, and the CCDs are more efficient size wise. On mobile, zen 5 is also better at power management which increases battery life.   Sure Zen 5 was trashed on desktop because the TDPs went way up, but that was an AMD choice and not necessarily because they're stagnate products.",Neutral

AMD,"What I fear the most is that Panther Lake is basically just it. It's, along with ARC, are one of the last things that was cooked under Gelsinger and they may not be able to cook up anything else under the new leadership.   AMD has had some stagnant refresh cycles, but they usually follow it up with a solid uplift in the following year. They've never had a Skylake under Lisa Su.",Negative
AMD,"That's entirely down to capacity constraints. Unlike AMD, Intel has pretty much its own separate supply chain whose sole purpose is to supply them silicon. AMD competes for nodes with Nvidia and Apple. They don't get enough chips to outsell Intel. In areas where AMD is able to supply properly (which are subsections of sections) they're able to thoroughly beat Intel. As an example iirc AMD actually had larger profits/revenue compared to Intel in Data centers despite them selling like 30% of all systems. That's because the higher profit margin sales unanimously went to them resulting in Intel only supplying the low cost products.  So yeah, Intel will always sell more but they lose profits at a faster rate than marketshare tells.",Neutral
AMD,"Yup, this has been 100% my experience. Even in Dell's storage servers, it's all Intel inside. I don't really care much but it's just an observation. For us to get AMD compute we have to specifically ask for it's like pulling teeth.",Neutral
AMD,In an enterprise environment you are rarely if ever just purchasing a CPU. You're buying whole systems and usually racks of them at a time.,Neutral
AMD,Note that losers might not mean bad. high clock rate is bad for server that want efficiency. so it's a win-win.,Neutral
AMD,"I think that for a while, AMD's limited resources had them sharply focused on a repeatable chiplet that could be dropped into a variety of packages. And they have gone super far with it, seeing much more success than chiplets in the GPU side.  But now we're seeing extensive variations on their mobile APUs. And Strix Halo that uses a completely different interconnect in place of SERDES. It's looking like AMD began to invest a portion of their profits into diversifying the product lines several years ago. So I would argue that EPYC and consumer lines have seen a bit of decoupling in their development.",Positive

By a bit you mean make a Frame Gen without frame pacing issues which makes it unusable, FSR4 to be widely available in all games like DLSS4 is, Reflex alternative to greatly cut the latency in a lot of games, Ray Tracing performance is still far behind NVIDIA and AMD's denoiser is worse than NVIDIA's.  Buying an AMD GPU is silly, you're getting a card with almost no modern features and those features that exist are either broken or available in 50 games at best.  I own a 9800X3D and an NVIDIA GPU, I don't attach myself to any brand, I attach myself to the best hardware that enhances my experience, and AMD GPUs  ain't it, at least currently.",Negative
AMD,I just got flashbacks to the Intel 14++++++ jokes,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah intel fell behind because they fumbled on the process node side big time. And they never caught up again. I remember them being first on ""tri-gate"" and then it was downhill from there.",Negative
AMD,"Their massive stock drop was directly due to the 13th and 14th gen issues + Ultra core being a complete dogshit move.  Their biggest mistake is as you said, not innovating while AMD catch up and surpassed them. Their design being locked in meant they'd have to be in catchup mode for years before the next process was ready.  Most servers in 2024 were still using Intel. By far.  The 13th and 14th gen issues caused MANY MANY providers to swap to AMD GPUs due to their servers literally dying.",Negative
AMD,"I still remember when they publically said that 10nm and 7nm were ""fundamentally broken at a process level"" and that they needed to buy new lights for $400M apiece.

AMD,Yes and AMD already paid for it. They can either choose to get some money by selling it as consumer chips or get no money.,Neutral
AMD,9070 is one of the most efficient gpu's out there. The 9070xt just botched up the power to deliver a more comparable performance to the 5070ti.

AMD RR looks to be pretty good, but no one can really say for sure because it's only in 1 game currently and a crappy game at that.",Negative
AMD,Frame gen issue is bad but fixable and IQ wise they've caught up.  FSR4s lack of support isn't on AMD. It's available in over a 100 games via driver override but if devs don't implement it that's not something AMD can fix. Support should be better going forward due to dlls but you can't put the blame for support on AMD here at all. New games support it.  Antilag is the reflex competitor.   Ray Tracing isn't a software issue at all. And outside of the worst case scenarios AMD is competitive enough and does better in the newer games that come out.  I haven't seen it said that the denoiser is worse than Nvidia. Just different.,Negative
AMD,Are you saying Intel was building their own lithography hardware or just their own design software?,Neutral
AMD,"They're great CPUs, arguably the best on desktop, just the initial reviews had negative tones because the high-TDPs meant more power consumption over Zen 4 and higher temps. But that was an AMD decision so they'd benchmark better, power and temp be damned.",Positive

AMD,"I had to pull over 60 of the AMD cards out of a 911 call center because they kept crashing in the 5 and 6 display setups.   We only used them because it was in 2022 when Dell couldn't source them for our models. We even had a conference call with an AMD driver engineer and they couldn't provide a consistent fix.  We ended up pulling all of the AMD cards out and replacing them with nvidia p620 cards from our surplus workstations and the issues went away.  You can say ""behind"" or ""shit"" or whatever other nuanced word you want but the reality is they were unusable in a critical environment.",Negative
AMD,"Is shit, not just behind.  It doesn't matter that FSR4 looks similar to DLSS4 if 90% of the games doesn't have it.    Same with Frame Gen, but in this case the Frame Gen is also much worse and there is no option of MFG.",Negative

Nope.

Except it is, NVIDIA started using ML-upscaling with DLSS2 in 2020 and that list of 500+ games that support  it was achieved throughout the years, meanwhile AMD only started using ML-upscaling with RDNA4 and it's completely on AMD that they're so behind NVIDIA in that regard.   >Support should be better going forward due to dlls but you can't put the blame for support on AMD here at all.

AMD,">Antilag is the reflex competitor.   We need to be clear when we say this that the reflex equivalent feature is anti-lag2, not anti-lag.  The original anti-lag is fine, but it's driver based and equivalent to Nvidia NULL. It's not nearly as effective as anti-lag2.  Anti-lag2 is equivalent to Nvidia reflex but, unfortunately, is not supported in nearly as many games. You can convert reflex to anti-lag2 with OptiScaler, and that actually works great, but OptiScaler is its own set of challenges. People want to fire up the game and not rely on anything external. ""It just works"" only works when the game properly implements the full set of features. This is Achilles heel. They really need to start flying devs to game developers HQ and get them to properly implement the full FSR stack. If it takes some kickbacks, so be it. That's now Nvidia plays the game and AMD needs to as well.",Negative
AMD,"They explicitly mentioned a $400M light source. So the problem with Intel's 10nm wafers was that their illumination system couldn't provide enough power and quality to drive consistent yields.  If you have not seen Veritasium's documentary on ASML and modern EUV/soft xray lithography, give it a watch. This stuff took more than 30 years to go from ""so impossible that peers treated it like a bad joke"" into ""the only technology that works"". Intel invested in ASML while still running its own research. Every other company working on EUV eventually gave up.  The stuff that we are using to build modern processors is essentially science fiction and right now ASML is the only company in the world with the precision required.",Negative
AMD,"Incidentally we are again approaching design limits, but this time Silicon itself is part of the problem. ASML claims to support precision within five Si atoms of alignment from layer to layer.  There's a lot of material research looking for tighter crystal structures and higher resistance to electron quantum tunneling, and groups proposing radical design changes are getting more funding again. I cannot imagine how much a next-gen wafer machine will cost.  ASML says they have a roadmap to go from 50k metal droplets/second up to 100k/s to make the light brighter and squeeze more life out of the current process.

AMD,">Yes, they can be fixed  Even if those issues can be fixed/improved, it requires extra work from the user, which most people simply won't do and they'll end up with a worse experience than If they just bought an NVIDIA GPU instead. Just think about it, you purchased an AMD GPU, to make Frame Gen work ""fine"" you have to make additional tweaks, to make FSR4 work in unsupported games you have to rely on mods, to reduce the game's latency, again, mods.  AMD's buyer experience is to save 100-200$, get 15-20% worse Ray Tracing performance, get way worse Path Tracing experience, lose access to Ray Reconstruction because sorry, FSR Redstone's Ray Regeneration is supported in only one game and to make features work you have to tweak them and/or mod them with OptiScaler, yay, definitely something that indicates that AMD is just slightly behind.  I purchased a 9800X3D because it's the best gaming CPU, I purchased an RTX GPU because it's the best gaming GPU, one of the reasons why AMD market share of dGPUs is so low is their inability to properly compete with NVIDIA on software side, and the only reason why they're even doing anything is consoles, they don't give a fuck about their dGPU market, they always tried to release their GPUs at a slightly lower price than NVIDIA and it never worked, since their market share on dGPU market is all time low, dropping from 23% in 2020 to 7% in 2025.  https://pcviewed.com/nvidia-vs-amd-discrete-gpu-market-share/",Negative
AMD,You do realize that this is basically a chicken and egg problem right? If no one has AMD GPUs then developers won't bother to include decent FSR. And if there is no FSR then people won't buy AMD.  Just be happy that there is competition and that for enough people AMD being a decent enough solution,Negative
AMD,"AMD has anti-lag, frame gen, and FSR upscaling. While their alternatives are often not the best, they do have them and they work. i can easily get 120fps using the driver based frame gen that doesn't require games have it built in. I use FSR sharpening for many games and it runs smoothly. Even in ray tracing, they've inproved drastically each gen with the next gen probably going to be close to current nvidia ray tracing performance.",Positive

AMD RX9070XT are 16.2k which makes it a good budget option although I still kinda feel it is overpriced as to pay that much for a gpu alone (almost twice the price off my whole pc) that will be outdated when new gpus launch kinda make a buy like that pointless.

AMD,I want Intel to win but sadly they only win against the HX370 which is a generation behind the 395+. So intel is still behind. They better price it well below the HX370 to regain market share.

If the B390 devices are cheaper, please make sure you plaster it everywhere and communicate it well. Even the people interested in it like me do not know or believe it.   Again if anyone at intel reads this, you better price this lower than the HX370 or you have no chance. I do not like AMD but sadly they have the best overpriced products right now.",Negative
AMD,this sounds about right.  Intel just said that the margins are PTL are below corporate average. which means yields on 18a are abysmal.  Expect prices to be high and supply to be low until yields improve (which the CFO head said wont be till 2027. But they should gradually improve through 2026.  AMD and intel are in a race. Intel need to improve 18a yields. AMD needs to get zen6 out. Whoever gets there first will be the winner. Until then it kinda looks like the laptop market is just a continuation of what it was before. AMD gets a slight pickup from the 400 series. Intel gets a slight bump from PTL.,Neutral

AMD,You are correct yes but everyone knew what i meant. i think.,Neutral
AMD,"> The thing is that there isn't market for it.  That's short sighted. There is a huge swath of radeon owners that try XeSS, realize it's better than FSR, and then plan to get an Intel GPU for their next upgrade cycle (or sooner).

AMD,Intel's been down this road before. It's not worth it. 14900HX is the only reminder you need. How fast does it need to be before we start talking about just putting a GPU in? If I'm getting a laptop why would I get a power hog collapsing star? It's called mITX.,Negative
AMD,Spinning a delay of building a competitor into this? Good try,Negative
AMD,"To completely compete with Strix Halo (really just the graphics side) would require intel to increase the die size just like AMD did. In practice, even in gaming, it isn't worth it. Yes, you get between 20-30% more performance with Strix Halo up to 65W, and then pushing 80w+ Strix Halo opens up further to closer to 40-50% better performance. Thing is, it just doesn't make sense to create a large APU with those power requirements for full performance in today's market... especially at the prices of Strix Halo products. You can just get a solution with a dGPU at those prices.  I just wish Intel would push for Linux compatibility. Panther Lake is being held back by the suck that is current Windows 11 imo.",Negative
AMD,"Hmm, that's a shame.  I really like Strix Halo.  They're niche, no doubt, but with NVIDIA having DGX Spark, and AMD releasing a ""competitor"" later this year, kind of surprised Intel is going to ignore the compact AI development market.",Negative
AMD,"From what I've seen today on reviews, they really trade blows at different TDP ranges. I'm yet to see benchmarks that come out with the 70 something percent gains Intel claimed.",Neutral
AMD,"LPDDR tends to be more power efficient than GDDR, especially when shared with the CPU. Not to mention you lose less power to communication. In other words, an iGPU will always be more power efficient than a dGPU.",Positive
AMD,It still might not be a competitor because it's going to be expensive as hell. If one wants the bleeding edge chip they have to fork it out.,Negative
AMD,The 70% claim is against Strix Point which is the similarly sized offering from AMD. It only trades blows with Strix Halo because that's a far larger (and expensive to manufacture) chip whose gpu portion is as large as a desktop RX 7700. More cores at lower clocks means better efficiency.,Neutral

AMD,"By ""this"" I meant the quote. As much as Pantherlake is great, I don't believe they were able to pull an AX launch off in time but simply didn't",Negative
AMD,It only trades blows at low power. Once you get higher wattages in it does not. But efficiency wise I think id trade my strip halo for an extra hour or battery gaming even with the lesser performance as I won't feel it much in the type of games I play. Panther Lake is a strategy gamers dream chip. Thin and light that can play the games at 1080p for 3 hours on battery.,Neutral

AMD,"Intel 7 was competitive in peak performance, but lacked efficiency. Also note that arrowlake utilized N3b which was notorious for poor yield and over complexity and quickly replaced with N3e in Apples line of products. Arrowlake also followed the 13th/14th gen debacle and Intel reduced ring bus clocks significantly to play it safe.  Most notably, going from a monolithic design to chiplets leads to increased latency which reduces gaming performance and makes it harder to hold higher clock speeds. Monolothic designs will always be faster in a 1:1 comparison but chiplets make up for it by being modular and cheaper to scale, something intel hasnt been able to really take advantage of until Pantherlake.",Negative
AMD,"The node helps, obviously, but you still need to design a product that works. The choice of node is not a magical solution.  Arrow Lake had flaws that showed themselves in certain workloads due to design. They \*did\* still get an overall efficiency boost but thats not a high bar given what they were coming from.",Neutral
AMD,"They were experimenting with tiles and it’s an early iteration. Not to mention they have more experience with their own fab.   Arrow lake smokes 14th gen in compiler workloads. Those faster e cores help a lot!   Outside of gaming workloads, it’s fine. Even with gaming workloads it does ok, just not a real jump from 14th gen. It was never going to beat x3d",Positive

AMD,Thanks for explaining,Positive
AMD,They still lose handily in efficiency and their multi core isn’t better than Strix Point,Negative
AMD,Not really. It loses against the 288v in the first test and wins against in the second test.  There is no direct comparison against the Ryzen 7 350 and I don't know how you even reached the conclusion that the Ryzen 7 350 is more efficient than lunar lake?  [Notebookcheck](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Panther-Lake-Core-Ultra-X9-388H-performance-analysis-Outpaces-Arrow-Lake-and-exceeds-Zen-5-in-efficiency.1212583.0.html) conducted fairly good efficiency tests that compare the single and multicore CPU perf/W. The Ryzen 7 350 is actually included in their list and ranks dead last in the multicore comparison so there's that and in the single core comparison Lunar Lake generally performs better than both but once again the Ryzen 7 350 is beaten by panther lake.  They even include a nice graph for different PL which also happens to include the Ryzen 7 PRO 350.,Neutral
AMD,"You are discussing SKUs. The reason lower stack PTL has fewer Xe cores is because they are nearly 2x efficiency.   However, should you take a higher SKU and configure TDP to 20W (or even 15W to account for external memory) it will be more efficient than Lunar. Lunar Lake is great, but PTL is much better.",Neutral
AMD,You'll see but not even in your wettest dreams the Ryzen will be beaten. Intel remains Intel after all.,Neutral
AMD,"It needs to be at least 2x as efficient to be as powerful because it has HALF as many cores. It isn't, therefore the GPU will be weaker. You can do that same TDP configuration on Lunar Lake. Not sure why that matters.  ""Nearly 2x more efficient"" translates to ""nearly as powerful"". But not quite.",Neutral
AMD,It is 70% faster. You’re comparing different SKUs. Compare top Lunar Lake to top Panther. How the TDP is configured is up to the OEM,Neutral
AMD,"We don't know how efficient those 28W Panther Lake chips run at 17W. Just because you can run it at such low power does not mean it will work well. It will certainly be much less efficient if it were to be run that way otherwise Intel would be gloating at how powerful and efficient their Panther Lake GPU is at 17W. The fact that they don't means it is well below their sweet spot of efficiency. You are basically starving it, similar to stalling an engine.",Negative
AMD,"The fact that it can even compare to AMDs halo product, which the avg consumer can’t afford is a win for Intel. Intel has plenty on leg room to expand the GPU too.",Positive
AMD,This suffers from bandwidth bottleneck. Strix halo is Quad channel while panther lake is dual. An igpu would benifit greatly with a quad channel,Negative
AMD,"This thing is absolutely nuts  AMD BTFO unironically, I'm floored. I never, ever would have considered an Intel chip before 2025, now this is the most obvious laptop part ever. AMD is surely sorely regretting recycling the same 780M and 890M chips for another entire gen, betting that Intel would continue stagnating.  This thing is gonna be a monster in handhelds.  I really, really wanted a Strix Halo laptop, but the lack of SKUs, price and the inflexibility with RAM kind of make it unappealing to say the least, not to mention the power draw compared to Panther Lake is unwelcome. These laptops are gonna be probably the best x86 in mobile has eaten in a very long time.  On top of that, it's almost making the 5050 look like a stupid part in a laptop. Why bother when you have a vastly more power efficient iGPU that will handle every desktop workload on top of being viable for gaming?",Negative

AMD,"We’re talking mobile chipsets here, strix halo is what happens when you throw efficiency out the window, with Power (TDP) range, typically from 55W up to 120W. The ultra H 300 has default TDP of 25W, with Maximum Turbo Power (MTP) going up to 65W-80W. Intel has a better design, if they threw 40 XeSS3 cores on it, it would prolly run circles around Strix.",Neutral

AMD,"> (more than) half the price  Have we seen pricing? Not doubting it, I just haven't seen anything personally but probably missed it.  Strix Halo does seem to be a pretty mythical chip due to its price.",Neutral
AMD,Keep in mind that each Xe3 core is about as wide as an AMD WGP. We're looking at 1536 vs 2560 shaders. The B390 is 60% as wide as the 8060S. 20 Xe3 cores would match the 8060S in width. 40x Xe3 is as wide as the 7900GRE.,Neutral
AMD,"Bingo  Strix is also limited by being RDNA 3.5 and no FSR4, so it's rather dependent on raw throughput, and it can't possibly fit in a comfortable handheld that would last for more than an hour and a half under load.  I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage. I hope they keep it up, it would really be cool to see an AMD vs Intel APU console war generation.",Neutral

AMD,">GPU's will take all the bandwidth you can feed them.   Didn't deny that. But 12 Xe cores is presumably considered the sweet spot, that's all I'm saying. And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.  Besides, Intel already has Nova Lake AX in the backlog, or whatever it's going to be called. Practically intel's strix halo. It'll have Xe3P cores, more powerful than Xe3, thus deemed more worthy of the halo treatment.",Neutral
AMD,"This is a big of exaggeration, as you can see with Nvidia moving to gddr7. While bandwidth has increased substantially, performance is clearly limited by lack of compute power",Negative

AMD,"Halo's die is still quite a bit bigger, but from the Intel side, you need to include IO, GPU and about half of the compute die which has the MCs, encoders / decoders, etc. to match the ""GPU"" die of Halo, so it is more like 200mm² to 300mm² when compared",Neutral

But all I need to know is it's faaar bigger.  >panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus  That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.",Neutral
AMD,"Well Panther uses mixed processes, and hybrid tiles are bound to be a bit less space efficient than putting everything on a single die. And to be fair, Halo GPU uses N4P process while Panther GPU uses N3E So, still not directly comparable.   Gotta say though, Arc's PPA has improved a lot since Alchemist and Battlemage.",Neutral
AMD,"> That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations.

Case and point, AMD's R9 Fury X. Released with 4096bit bus HBM. Had a total memory bandwidth of 512GB/s. Yet the GTX 980 Ti released with a 384bit bus and 336GB/s memory bandwidth and it out performed the Fury X in pretty much everything.

AMD,"The SKU count is roughly doubled because you have each step with/without vPro - these get a 100MHz max turbo frequency bump, but the main benefit is you can run the corporate firmware with vPro support, so you get additional security and manageability features. Exception is the Ultra 9 where they just do it with vPro support as standard.  These have a higher cost because you are getting more features.  You could make it so you just have one CPU and then the manufacturer pays a license for corporate firmware per device, but that's more work to then ensure manufacturers are licensing machines correctly, and more confusing for end-users where now if you're buying a corporate device with vPro support you know you are looking at Core Ultra 236V and 268V for vPro support whilst 226V and 258V don't have it.",Neutral

As of right now only the ending 8 differentiates the 338H from the small-GPU SKUs, which IMO is not clear enough.

It's not being ""mistaken"" for a regression, it quite literally is one.   The problem is also that AMD also has disaggregated their compute from their IMC, and yet has *better* latency on *less advanced* packaging.   >The controversy here isn't that Intel failed to push frequency; it is that they deliberately chose to execute a hard pivot away from the monolithic brute force strategy of Raptor Lake to a disaggregated chiplet design that prioritizes area efficiency and performance-per-watt over raw, latency-sensitive throughput.  Nothing about ARL's current design prioritizes ppw or area efficiency over RPL's design from a chiplets vs monolithic perspective. ARL isn't enabling higher core counts from going chiplets, that seems to be left to NVL according to rumors. And chiplets carries an area penalty over monolithic designs anyway.   >The removal of Hyper-Threading from the Lion Cove P-cores is the most contentious yet logically sound decision engineers could have made given the thermal constraints of modern silicon.   This makes no sense   >By removing the simultaneous multithreading logic, specifically the duplication of architectural state and the complexity required in the reorder buffers and schedulers to handle two threads, Intel was able to physically widen the core and increase the L2 cache per core to 3MB without blowing up the die size  SMT costs Zen 5 less than 5% in area btw.

Maybe gaming or some benchmarks are, but for the large part, no.   You can see this two ways, LNC's structural gains (core width, ROB capacity, etc etc) have smaller gains, percentage wise, over their predecessor versus something you would see in GLC vs SNC, or SNC vs SKL.

AMD,"AMD had a very similar experience with their first generation of Ryzen CPUs. One of the differences here is Intel had a competitive product prior to their architectural shakeup. Had Intel totally croaked for years and not been competitive in the CPU space the narrative would be completely different and everyone would be singing their praises.  Aside from that I think the biggest problem with this new architecture is simply there's little reason to buy in. It was only recently (if memory serves, I could be wrong on this) announced that the next generation of CPUs will share this platform and later ones will be on a new socket. When AM4 was announced we knew that it would persist for multiple generations and now with AM5 - why would you buy a board that will be obsolete when its time to upgrade when you could buy into a platform that will support your next 1-2 CPUs? Especially with the old intel socket performing just as well on a more mature platform, for most end users this first core ultra series just isn't worth investing.",Neutral

AMD,"IMO corrupt tech sites and tech YouTubers are behind ARL’s failure for two reasons.   The first: AMD MCM processors without 3D cache are bad for gaming, and it’s hard to find this information in 90% of charts to warn intel about the consequences of going down this path, even though they should have done their own tests and experiments.   The second: in my own tests, the 265K was 15% faster than the 9700X on launch BIOS. Through BIOS updates, that gap extended to 20%, making it only 7%-10% slower than the 14700K. Yet on some very questionable charts, the 265K is shown as slower than the 9700X.   For experienced users, RPL CPUs’ temperatures can be lowered by 20°C by turning Hyper-Threading off and undervolting. For inexperienced users, ARL is better, as it runs 20°C cooler out of the box.   I believe that in 2026 we deserve raw, unedited video benchmarks that start from the desktop, show full system specs, then enter game-by-game benchmarking—no more charts with zero evidence to back them up.   When I tried to confront HUB with my benchmarks, I got blocked to cover up their lies and corruption. If they truly cared about which CPU is faster, they would share their in-game benchmark scores and discuss them in a scientific way, but that’s not their goal. The numbers go up and down for the highest bidders.   Lastly, I believe Nova Lake, with its expected 144 MB cache, will be faster than Zen 6 X3D by 10–20% as 9700x in real world is 20% slower than 265k and if both got the same IPC uplift NL will end up on top.

AMD,"285K seems to have fantastic workstation performance, I didn't think much before selecting Intel over AMD parts for work to be honest, considering the efficiency gains. We landed on 265K, it benches very favorably compared to AM5 parts in nearly every workload except for gaming, and even then, that's mostly the X3D parts, and even then, that's when there is virtually no GPU bottleneck.   Most initial ""gaming"" reviews were done exclusively with 5090s, which is extremely unrealistic for most gamers and gave an extremely false impression that you would see a massive uplift by buying this part compared with the alternative CPU parts in gaming.   A lot of reviewers such as HUB have done a lot of work to correct this impression with a variety of testing scenarios and explaining their reasoning behind removing the GPU limiting factor as much as possible in benchmarks. Incidentally, these reviews typically showed that anything less than a 5080 sees virtually no benefit with a 9800X3D versus, say, a 9700X, and incidentally the two parts that saw no discernible benefits were the Radeon 9070XT and the 9070.  Obviously, if you have a 5090 and an unlimited budget with price being no factor, your best bet for top tier performance in all categories is a 9950X3D, but that just isn't what most people are looking at.  I myself bought into the future proofing mentality with my CPU and bought a 9800X3D, and ironically bought another AMD Radeon 9070XT to pair it with, a GPU that seems literally no performance gain compared to a 9700X, let alone a 285K. The same 285K that takes a dump all over the 9800X3D in nearly every other productivity benchmark.  I guess the good news is that when I upgrade my GPU in 2-4 years, at least I'll take advantage of the 9800X3D in games, lol. But considering it cost me over $900 for CPU, RAM, and motherboard, that's cold comfort.

AMD,"I suspect they just didn't have enough time to change anything. MTL releasing in Dec 2023, internal testing I'm sure yielding some set of data, and external reviews giving other feedback, even by the release of MTL, ARL has probably been in the pipeline for years and probably locked into certain design choices regardless of the feedback and testing.  Additionally I suspect that on mobile chips/laptop gaming rigs there's less focus on each individual part because  a) few people hardcore game on laptops b) the latency can be blamed on other things since laptops are a prepackaged consortium of parts and it's harder to isolate, and  c) therefore laptops tend to be evaluated as a whole rather than the individual pieces that comprise them.   Therefore the ""latency issues"" only became a massive kerfuffle when the offending cpu could be isolated and tested alone, and reviewers needed something to complain about.   That's even if Intel was considering latency as the issue everyone made it out to be. Intel could have looked at it and considered the latency worth the cost to improve in other areas and serve as intels seminal desktop entry utilizing disaggregated silicon. Then gamers came and lost their shit that the newest Intel chip deprioritized something that impacted their precious fps- even though the impact was ""the new one is approximately the same to maybe a little worse as last gen in most games"".   Notwithstanding the fact that the 200 series chips retain healthy gen-to-gen perf uplift and a _massive efficiency improvement_ in productivity and general computing, and boosting the NGU and D2D clocks (which are _very_ low from the factory, and can be done with the app that Intel _has specifically designed for tuning their chips_ and is freely available (XTU)) brings the gaming performance to ""approximately the same to a little better in most games"". Contrary to what some people may think these chips are not solely or even majority used for gaming and there are other use cases Intel can to think about/chose to prioritize.   To be fair, gamers and tech enthusiasts are the ones who will care the most and therefore have a disproportionately large impact on the kind of publicity the chip will get. So, was this intels smartest PR decision? Maybe not. But I think it was still a sound engineering decision, regardless of whether or not they had feedback or data on the issue, even if it didn't go over very well with their loudest customer base.  And this is all overshadowed by the fact that if you stuck even the most hardcore of gamers on a blind trial and told them to identify what kind of chip they were gaming on, I have a hard time believing any of them would be able to tell with any certainty which is which.   Once you get to 60 fps, the vast majority of people stop caring. Whats five fps going to do to radically change your gaming experience so much that it's unplayable? Which brings me back to one of my original points: If you care _that much_, you can go spend your money _elsewhere_.",Neutral

AMD,"Let me explain why it will not degrade my CPU.  1. **TVB (Thermal Velocity Boost) is disabled when I set the turbo limit.** 2. **Current is not the issue.** First, even Intel chips were failing at idle. Second, you stated that ""the same power limit at lower voltage necessarily means more current."" That is incorrect, if it drew more current, then why does lowering voltage reduce power consumption? Have you missed basic physics? 3. **CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve.** The main issue was that either the CPU or the motherboard was supplying excessive voltage, or the CPU was requesting too much. Higher voltage is required for extreme single-core boosts, such as 5.9 GHz. This is why i3 and i5 CPUs were not affected. When I limit my boost and apply an undervolt, the CPU no longer requests high voltage. It might request slightly higher voltage for 5.5 GHz, but that is nowhere near the voltage required for a 5.9 GHz boost. 4. **The same principle applies.**  Its seems you are a failure of high life form.   Maybe read here more. it was already to high voltage   [https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop-Instability-Root-Cause/post/1633239](https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop-Instability-Root-Cause/post/1633239)  Maybe you havent read much. if you undervolted only using AC/DC loadline and didnt limit max frequency.

I think maybe you forget that AMD had to offload global foundries, I don't think anyone even blinked when that happened and it's likely because that was a different era.   My post had nothing to do with the bailout versus architecture (or saving it) , apart from mentioning that I don't believe as a consumer I should feel motivated to buy Intel over AMD, or any other American firm, at the moment.   To be very clear, as this is personal for you, I do own Intel equipment including an Arc graphics setup for one of my children. I'm not anti-Intel or anti-American at all.   I know the history between AMD and Intel fairly well. Oversimplifying, AMD as it is doesn't exist without Intel. AMD only grew because they were the most successful second source producer for Intel, and the most successful at riding the thin grey line between patient infringement and unique implementation of similar IP that kept them alive while everyone else in the X86 space either died or became irrelevant to the consumer or enterprise space. After Itanium, the story levels out with both companies becoming effectively unwilling AMD64 codependents, and I'm saying that humorously.   Intel would gladly own the X86 market outright. So would AMD. At the end of the day, we need the two driving innovation through competition. Even if the CHIPS Act, the government stock acquisition, and the nVidia partnership are solely aimed at bringing more, needed, chip manufacturing to the US, it could create a situation where that amount of leverage puts Intel into a hyper dominant position again in the near future.

Broadwell-E and early Skylake also weren’t great for OC.   -Once the node matured, things improved again. Coffee Lake (refined 14nm) made 5 GHz relatively easy. The same pattern repeats with 10nm: Alder Lake (12th gen) came after Tiger Lake and could already reach ~5 GHz, while Raptor Lake pushed clocks even higher, up to ~5.7 GHz.

Also coming out of standby some odd things I have been seeing is that my BD-R drive sometimes will not transfer to my HDD and my USB ports will not read external drives.  Is there a possibility that the processor is having issues? I have not seen any crashes. Any way to pinpoint this to what could be causing it?  Thanks",Negative
AMD,Hi guys. I just put a RMA request in for my CPU and was emailed 10 minutes later saying that my SWR case was created. I got sent a set of instructions for packaging and shipping but no attachment was sent for an AWB label or RCI. Does this come later? Or would I need to contact Intel directly to recieve it?,Neutral
AMD,"Hello, I purchased an Intel 265K and am looking for a motherboard for it.  I would like to know if B860 motherboards allow us to undervolt or set power limit on the CPU.  I also want to know what we can do with memory?  I'm not really into overclocking the CPU, but the first two are important to me in order to control power and temperatures since I'm putting this in a small form factor mini ITX build.  I can live without detailed memory tweaks, just as long as we can set XMP profile.  If I can save money by avoiding Z890 that would be great.",Neutral
AMD,"u/Chelostyles Thank you for your inquiry regarding the CPU and RAM upgrade for your Dell Vostro 3670. As much as I'd like to provide my technical insights on this upgrade path, I'm not in a position to provide specific suggestions since this involves hardware modifications to an OEM system.  For the best compatibility outcome and to ensure optimal system performance, I strongly recommend reaching out to your system manufacturer directly. They can provide definitive guidance on supported CPU upgrades (i5-8400 to i7-9700) and maximum RAM configurations for your specific model. We don't want to inadvertently bypass any warranty terms and conditions on your system by providing modification recommendations that might affect your coverage.  Your system manufacturer's technical support team will have access to the exact specifications, BIOS compatibility matrices, and supported hardware configurations for your Vostro 3670 model. They can confirm whether the motherboard supports the i7-9700, the maximum RAM capacity (64GB vs 128GB), and any potential limitations or requirements for these upgrades.  This approach ensures you get accurate, manufacturer-validated information while maintaining your system's warranty protection.",Neutral
AMD,"u/I_like_carsyay  XPS 15 9530 hardware does support Resizable BAR, which is why Intel's system detection shows it as available for both your Arc A370M and Iris Xe graphics. However, the system manufacturer has designed their BIOS interface to prioritize stability and user-friendliness, often managing advanced PCIe features like ReBAR automatically in the background rather than exposing manual configuration options. This approach ensures optimal system performance while reducing complexity for users. I recommend checking for the latest BIOS updates from your OEM's support site and contacting their technical support team, as they would have the most current information about how ReBAR is implemented on your specific model and whether any additional configuration steps are needed to fully utilize this feature.     I've posted an article below in case you haven't yet come across it:  **Helpful Resources:**  *  [What Is Resizable BAR and How Do I Enable It?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090831/graphics.html)",Neutral

AMD,"Late to this, but I'm a 13900K owner. I have not had any issues with stability since applying the BIOS update and haven't noticed any performance loss, so I think this is fine. I did not thoroughly benchmark before and after though, partially because of how high peak temperatures were before the update. I am using a Noctua NH-D15 and a contact frame to reduce CPU temperatures.  Up until a few days ago I would have said that thread scheduling isn't an issue, but then I played the game Maneater and it's basically unplayable unless you use launch options to force the game to only P-cores. There's the Intel ""Application Optimizer (APO)"" utility but it seems abandoned and you can't add your own games if Intel hasn't added a profile. I was a big proponent of E-cores but honestly it seems like a half-baked technology that Intel never put the effort in to support properly. That said I guess I could just entirely disable them if I cared so much, but that's a non-trivial amount of performance to just give up.",Neutral

AMD,"I used to run my i3-540 at 4.2GHz, air cooled on what is effectively worse than a Hyper 212 Evo. I miss the old days when I could overclock the snot out of them. These days I guess they're binned to almost their max potential out of the factory so most of the time I'm undervolting them.",Negative
AMD,Well done. Still using two H55m machines with OC (x3450 and i5 661).  They also OC decently at stock voltage keeping turbo and all power savings. My X3450 does 2.6 -> 3.3Ghz(3.8 turbo). The advantage is that it idles quite low at 50-60W.   But for gaming and rendering it's better to go all in as you did. Most chips can do anywhere from 3.8 to 4.2 all cores IME.,Positive
AMD,nah my 40 logical processors would smash through it all  x2 xeon e5-2680 v2,Neutral
AMD,"I was just given a vinyl cutter and it's powered by an old tower server with an x3450. I was thinking about junking it but for being old, it's a nice tower. Can put 8 x 3.5in drives in it. I may just clean it up and see what I can turn it into.",Positive
AMD,"is that better? I dont need to dive into setting anymore, the CPU maker do it for me with warranty.",Neutral
AMD,"There is still more to work with, especially if one does not fossilize on static all core OC, but does 2-step TVB fueled dynamic OC, Ecores are Aldo the source of much happiness on arrow",Positive
AMD,I miss overclocking. Felt like you were getting a bargain. Now I don’t even try.,Negative
AMD,"Not as big an OC as yours, but I had a pre-built from FutureShop.  It was their home brand name.  Found a BIOS for the board that wasn’t theirs.  Managed to get 3.2GHz out of a 2.4GHz Pentium 4 on pre-built from FutureShop cooling.",Neutral
AMD,"Wow, soo cool",Positive
AMD,The motherboard doesn't accept other stick of ram. Only my corsair ram work,Negative
AMD,How did you even get a 6950x to boot at 5.2ghz? Most of them hit a wall around 4.3ghz,Negative
AMD,"Has its ups and downs. Now that I'm older and have less time to tweak things and mostly just want shit to be stable, I see ""pre-overclocked with maybe 5% performance left on the table"" as a pro. The con is that chipmakers just jam a ton of power through it to make it happen, and the option of buying a half-price chip and spending an entire sleepless weekend tweaking it yourself to get 95% of the more expensive chip's performance is gone.",Negative
AMD,"Same - the complexity and heat rose a lot and the gains because less significant - with multi-core chips and turbo frequencies there just isn't much headroom in them.  That and I work fixing issues with computers all day, I just want my own PC to work.",Negative
AMD,"Thats because these older CPUs were surprisingly energy efficient. Also mostly because now modern CPUs are powerful enough where overclocking is pointless. Even my i3-12100 being overclocked would be pointless, even if its only a 80 watt CPU",Negative
AMD,He couldn't without LN2.,Neutral
AMD,"It was short lived, over ~7 years I had to pull back the multiplier from 52 to 44 to keep it stable.  I retired the system this year.  It was a full open loop from EK.  2x Pascal Titan X in SLi",Neutral
AMD,"I used to overclock everything, now I undervolt everything lol",Neutral
AMD,"The most important characteristics of a laptop are battery life ( power efficiency) and screen quality. That is what sells ( non apple ) clamshells.    All the other crap they test in various reviews are mostly meaningless to the actual user. There is a very small %age of the market for high power/perf laptops and even smaller market for gaming.   Most of the reason a laptop is “slow” is bloatware and has nothing to do with the cpu choice anyway.  And Intel is already “beating” AMD in laptop cpu sales, by a substantial margin. People incorrectly assume AMD has most of the market share in all segments because of the very noisy and super-biased gaming reviewers, who mostly focus on $3000+ gaming desktop builds. Yes AMD is handily winning there.",Neutral
AMD,"I have a T14s Gen 5 Core Ultra 5 135U and recently I saw \~9h of battery life, browsing websites. It's quite nice piece of hardware so with Lunar Lake it would be just perfect. Of course not for heavy workload because for this we will have Panther Lake. I work in tech for years, not an expert in laptops area but I can assure you that new CPUs from Intel that I mentioned earlier are way, way, way better than previous generations.",Positive
AMD,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works. It's like the 2001 Toyota of the laptop world, it's not winning prizes for looks, but it'll never die, gets good mileage (battery life), and is easily repairable. Maybe not the laptop you want, but definitely the one you need (excluding people who need something like a dedicated GPU or really need super high CPU performance).",Positive
AMD,"Intel beats AMD in software (drivers, firmware) … I got think pad 780M laptop by company I work for. Randomly display won’t get detected. Randomly audio device goes missing. Not fun thing to reboot your laptop and miss 10 minutes of meeting.",Negative
AMD,"Soldered RAM sucks.  Nothing beats popping out the standard 8GB stick(s) a notebook may come with, installing a couple 2x32GB sticks yourself and having it actually work.",Negative
AMD,lol. Even in the cons it says weaker multicore than AMD….?   This article seems like AI wrote it,Negative
AMD,"Unfortunately Intel abandoned the on-package RAM after Lunar Lake again, which is the primary reason for the great efficiency and low power usage. I kind of understand why, it's expensive and not very flexible, plus apparently the market doesn't actually care that much about long battery runtimes. Only a small minority of people are ready to pay premium for this.",Negative
AMD,At work we are a Lenovo shop and recently swapped from Intel to AMD T14 laptops. Too many issues with Intel and the AMD models offer the same performance for less money.,Negative
AMD,Suck at gaming.,Negative
AMD,Try a modern mac and tell me its not the CPU holding the UX back. It's all about the cpu's.,Neutral
AMD,"That would be nice. We have a bunch of laptops with Intel's i5, 13th gen I believe it was. 2 p-cores, some e-cores. They are all slow as fuck. I mean it. The CPU is so extremely slow and goes into tdp limit right away. Most users hate them.  Battery life is ok, but they are really bad in terms of performance.  So - I wouldn't say CPU doesn't matter.",Negative
AMD,"AMD is held back in laptops by some shady deals of laptop manufacturers with Intel. It's impossible to get a 4k AMD laptop with 5090 for example, all of those are Intel (I found literally one AMD laptop like that compared to 25 from Intel). That's utterly ridiculous.",Negative
AMD,Isn’t the keyboard one of the most important characteristics?,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, so much of laptop performance is dictated by things other than the cpu. Its kinda wild.   Intel does a way better job getting good laptop designs. Amd historically has just been a cpu seller, telling oems to go wild and do whatever . . . And it always ends very badly.   The biggest sign amd is taking share is not cpu benchmarks, but will be things like having premium screens, good thermals, lack of bloatware, dual channel memory, good SSDs, good colors, etc etc. and . . . ACTUAL AVAILABILITY. I dunno how many reviews i see where they review and intel and amd parts. Usually there is some way intel has a better premium finish. And then amd just has zero ways to actually buy their model. Its the weirdest thing.",Negative
AMD,"Hey I’m looking at the exact same laptop that you have. Can you tell me about the build quality and if there’s any keyboard flex when pressing down on it? Please tell me. I’m going to use it for word, excel, reading lots of pdf files and ebooks and watch movies. Will it be enough for that?",Neutral
AMD,Omg a positive review for Intel Lunar Lake 😭  https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/s/RYInPJfnAd,Positive
AMD,"But haven't you heard, AMD beats Nvidia slightly at linux gaming benchmarks.  That means AMD has the best software support.",Positive
AMD,"I miss the times when laptops were far more upgradeable. I got a budget laptop for college with a low-end dual core, a spinning HDD, and 1 stick of 2GB RAM. By the time I retired it ~6 years later I've upgraded the CPU, replaced the HDD with a SSD, and added 2x4GB sticks of RAM. I also could've swapped out the network card and even the DVD drive for another SATA drive, but never got around to those.",Neutral
AMD,Soldered ram is a lot faster. So no.,Neutral
AMD,Yes but now RAM costs a ton of money,Negative
AMD,Is multicore performance the only consideration when buying a laptop?,Neutral
AMD,What kind of issues?,Neutral
AMD,What kind of issues with Intel? I thought it was the AMD that had tons of issues,Negative
AMD,It is not a gaming laptop,Neutral
AMD,"Yep. More specifically, it's mostly the single thread performance and efficiency.  It's how a MacBook Air can be fanless, run super fast, and stay cool at the same time while you're doing work with it.",Positive
AMD,It's an enterprise grade product you buffoon.,Negative
AMD,Exactly. Thinkpads are not targeting average Joes. They are targeting business and enterprise customers. Their Yoga and Ideapads are targeting the regular Joes.,Neutral
AMD,Build quality.    Thinkpads are solid machines that are easy to fix.    It's one of the few laptops that comes close to MacBook quality and everything judt working.,Positive
AMD,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good. It seems the Intel chip was designed to be very efficient during periods of downtime and something like viewing a PDF or editing a document has a LOT of downtime for the CPU",Positive
AMD,"Because only on Linux, Valve heavily funds AMD driver development and they also get other community contributions. The commonly used RADV vulkan driver was started as a community effort without AMD involvement.",Neutral
AMD,"I hope you're joking(sorry if you are), cos Nvidia isn't actually a good benchmark for software support on Linux. Intel is so much better at Linux software support than Nvidia",Negative
AMD,"The question is, is the soldered ram you're buying in a laptop faster than the ram you can buy and install yourself?",Neutral
AMD,All the more reason to make it upgradable,Positive
AMD,Lunar Lake isn’t how Intel beats Amd lol. Panther lake will stop a lot of the bleeding for sure. AMD is so far making mostly good moves and Intel is as well with LBT. The goal for Intel over the next 3 years is stop losing customers base. I will point out Intel still has about 75% of all x86 customers.,Neutral
AMD,"I mean, the only other pro is, that you cannot get the 2.8K panel on the AMD version for some reason..... sooo",Negative
AMD,This was back when the 14th generation were having issues.,Negative
AMD,"It's $2,000 so no excuse.",Neutral
AMD,Thank you so much for this valuable and comprehensive information! I really appreciate it:),Positive
AMD,"Usually yes, soldered ram will be faster. And in case of lunar lake, it is faster and more efficient due to it being packaged with the cpu. Like Apple's unified memory.",Positive
AMD,"Lunar Lake already beat AMD, nobody buys AMD laptops",Neutral
AMD,i stopped at $2100 for a Thinkpad T14,Neutral
AMD,"Ah okay, got it thanks.",Positive
AMD,Panther Lake fixed it,Neutral
AMD,wrong  Nobody Supply AMD laptop     There fixed for u,Negative
AMD,"I do, and many of the people I know do.",Neutral
AMD,Nobody pays that much.,Negative
