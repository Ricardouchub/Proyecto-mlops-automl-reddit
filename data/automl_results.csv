Intel,I thought that was Denis lol,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah this is a really surprisingly open factory tour, at least compared to when Sapphire took Linus and Alex along. It feels unprecedented to see this much access and insight, but that's the goodwill nurtured by Steve paying off in spades. The lament about AMD and Nvidia ditching the sub-250 side is real, so having Arc actually be a usable option down here is going to be significant later on.",Positive
Intel,"Pretty good video with a lot of detail I haven't seen in previous factory tours. I probably still won't use an Intel GPU for gaming, but for a media server it's probably sufficient.  Side note: It's funny how whenever a GN video gets posted, the same cast of characters comes out and writes essays criticizing the video, apparently without watching it. I guess that's what it means to ""make it"".",Positive

Intel,"To be fair this is not a clean room, just SMT assembly. Basically, soldering components. A lose hair might be a bit of a problem (kind of like in any factory), but his hair is tied and doesn't seem to be an issue.

Intel,"Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket. To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of similar performance or even outperforming the cards in those brackets.

Intel,"They're talking about the A310 and A380, of which Nvidia doesn't have anything made in this decade to compete with and AMD has the 6400 that came out 5 years ago.  The only cards with modern features in that price segment that consumers can directly buy are the A310 and A380.",Neutral
Intel,He(Lucas) stated $100 was the market that was abandoned.  10:37  > Steve: So why still making A310?  > Lucas: Because what's the competitor have? Nvidia? like... GT710? GT1030? (laughs) No way. So literally Nvidia AMD already give up the segment of this like... $100 price card.,Neutral
Intel,This guy was talking about the A310 which is a $100 GPU. Basically said that the only other options at that price bracket are either a GT 710 or a GT 1030. And from AMD you can still get an old RX 550. The A310 may be slow but it beats those two gpu's by a mile.,Neutral

Intel,"> Love how 5050 is actually at msrp now cheapest b580 is $349+  Just an FYI but B&H has the [Acer Nitro B580 for $249.99](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1874395-REG/acer_dp_z4bww_p01_nitro_oc_arc_b580.html) and the [Intel Limited Edition model for $259.99](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1869297-REG/intel_31p06hb0ba_arc_b580_limited_edition.html). So you can get B580 for MSRP, but for how long who knows.",Positive
Intel,"die area is not the only cost indicator. B580 actually uses N5 fab, which is likely cheaper than N4, used by 5050. In reality, B580 only has about ~15% more transistors and if we assume N5 is cheaper per transistor and N5 has higher yields (by being more mature) i'd say their die cost might be very similar.  While yes, it has wider memory, the chips are clocked lower, so they can buy slower bins, reducing per chip cost.   B580 has more power draw, which in turn costs more for power delivery and cooling.  All in all, AIB manufacturer likely has lower margin per card as it stands, so i wouldn't be surprised if intel is taking a lower margin on the gpu/gddr combo to get more market share.  Nvidia on the other hand optimized their cost REALLY well, as they have been doing GPUs for almost 30 years.",Neutral
Intel,"Nvidia is getting such good performance out of such a small die because they're the best. Simple as. They've been doing GPU's for decades. It's not unexpected that at this stage Intel needs to use a larger die to match the performance - it would be incredibly surprising if that wasn't the case.  But a small *part* of that die size advantage comes from that narrow 128bit bus, and *part* of B580's appeal is its wider bus and subsequently more VRAM.",Positive

Intel,This sub is genuinely weird. They complain about PCMR when the level of discourse here is much worse and a lot more mean spirited.,Negative
Intel,"They are truly rage baiting drama mongers sadly. The fact that the causes they support happen to be semi legit and consumer friendly in nature does not take away from the fact that they are essentially drama and negativity for profit at this point, and often out of touch with reality. You can be positive, polite, and have reporting standards while still calling out shitty behavior and ripping bad practices to pieces.   Companies are not your friend. That includes GN. They stoke hardware enthusiast anger for their own gain. Personally i think the harm they do to the space/peoples mentality is farm more than the amount of good most (key word most, fire risks and stuff deserve prompt drama) of their coverage does.   Even this title takes a topic and very educational opportunity to provide actual hardware coverage and immediatly try’s to stoke negative furry about some aspect of the hardware industry. Its just non stop with them. I dont think its healthy for anyone to watch then honestly, which is sad as i used to enjoy their review/news. I hope for their sake they are not actually so perpetually angry and they are doing what they do to knowingly manipulate their audience for increased views/engagement. I cant imagine living life so constantly angry at every possible point over computer hardware, as much as i am saddened by the current state hardware and love gaming.   As tough as it is with rising prices and such and sad to think of what we could have instead, modern hardware, gaming, and such is in a nearly historic good state (realistic cost to perf is probably lowest in history other than brief periods such as the 30 series launch), and is a very cost effective hobby compared with other ones for the time you get out of it. Many great games launch all the time (even if big name traditional games have largely went to trash). They are easier to run with hardware (like the ARC gpu) being quite cheap and capable. People, like GN, need to temper their overexagerated frustration with a dose of real world perspective and objectivity.",Negative

Intel,yeah there is a reason the a310 cards they are making are 4 hdmi out.  Gotta know your market,Neutral
Intel,I assume those are being marketed to OEMs who make digital billboard systems or something. No idea why else you would want 4 HDMI ports on a card.,Neutral
Intel,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310. Almost anything these days is better than an A310.  >  Like the GT710 make no sense nowadays (their last attempt was what, the GeForce GTX 1630?), even though they sold like hotcakes for offices and for people who just wanted HDMI outs.  GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered. GTX 1630 was okay but it was supposed to be $149 USD MSRP and it came out for like $200 USD in most stores due to GPU shortage at the time, not much NVIDIA could really do about that.",Neutral

Intel,"Compared to my 890M based laptop, the 890M numbers here are about 15-20% lower than what I'm seeing at the same settings.  This is likely due to power targets?  Even if the uplift is just 60% instead of 80%, that's still an impressive achievement for the B390M.  It's a shame that AMD appears to have dropped the iGPU ball in 2026.  Relying on the Strix Halo is not an option here.  It's pretty much impossible to find a good laptops that use it.  The upcoming HX470, and still without FSR4, isn't going to close the apparent large gap.  It seems that AMD forgot to stay hungry and they'll end up losing whatever ground that they'd gained in the last few years.

Intel,"I think the B390 could be faster than even an RTX 5050 35W (As it could beat an RTX 4050 at 60W).       These thin and light laptops that Panther Lake is built for use way underpowered GPUs. Honestly, it makes sense why the Dell XPS 14 only has the B390 graphics. Before it used an RTX 4050, but it ran at just 30W of power.

Intel is really dependent on CCG, it is double in revenue to DCAI. They invest in what makes them money. Compared to AMD, client and DCAI is doing well, for client CPUs and GPUs are doing well, putting no pressure in mobile, in fact their strategy has remained the same in the past couple the years and even if marginally their % share is sufficient for them.

Intel,"They announced a first party Strix Halo PC at CES, but it'll probably be really expensive.",Neutral
Intel,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips. But if you want true performance, just go out and buy an RTX X060 series laptop it's far better price to perf each generation.",Neutral

Intel,"I am not talking about product classes though? The original statement is trying to say that an **SoC can compete with dedicated iGPU** regardless if Strix Halo is bigger.

Yes, they are different product classes, but Panther Lake SKUs that have 10-12 Xe3 cores will most definitely be >$1000 with laptops. ""Mainstream"" pricing is subjective in this class, unlike GPUs where there are 5060s and 5080s segments. At CES, there are surprisingly dGPUs still being paired with Panther Lake, heck, Strix Halo was designed purely for it's iGPU, even the engineers stand by this (PCIe slots are being released in miniPCs because that's what the market wants).  Also, this ""big APU"" argument is based on chiplets/tiles. Strix Halo isn't monolithic, same as Panther Lake. They both have the same design strategy that makes it economically viable to tape out in the first place.

Arrow lake (Desktop) at least closed on efficiency, but lacks a bit of gaming performance still, hopefully Nova Lake will be the step required to push more competition.   On GPU the same, AMD does not compete with NVIDIA in higher segments while NVIDIA is fairly comfortable with their setup and increases prices because they want to milk customers to increase their ridiculious margins (up to 70%) that they are used to from AI-Chips.   And now Intel also provides Multi-Frame generation, while a niche for me still, starting to compete with AMD and closes up to NVIDIA in terms of Software support, which they lacked the most and fixes a lot of problems.

Intel,"I got downvoted everytime I brought this up, but this is precisely why Nvidia wanted a deal to have an Nvidia iGPU tile on an Intel APU: Large iGPUs in thin and lights are going to get good enough over the next few years to make them the new entry-level graphics option for people. This directly threatens Nvidia's consumer laptop volume in the entry segment. Intel is claiming close to 4050 performance at this lower TDP, and that's certainly good enough for many to not have the tradeoffs of having a dGPU in their laptop.  If the new market is moving towards putting GPUs on the CPU package instead of discretely on the board, Nvidia doesn't want to place all of their hopes on WoA becoming better, and are hedging by doing both their own SoC *and* an x86 APU with Intel.  The XPS line dropping Nvidia discrete all together is proof of this. In these sub 70W total laptop power markets, a discrete GPU is just eats into the power budget too much.",Neutral
Intel,"In the ultraportables market (like XPS), integrated graphics just make so much sense (energy envelope; cooling system required; battery life; etc); and that's already substantial and before considering the cost of a NVIDIA mobile dGPU itself.

Intel,The relative proportion of the die isn't as important as the die size itself and the node ofc.   Lunar lake for example has an estimated die size smaller than the hx370 so even if they did make the die bigger I don't think that is going to massively raise the price. Not to mention intel owns the foundry unlike AMD who are outsourcing to TSMC. This isn't in the realm of a strix halo competitor with a 300 mm\^2 + die size.   Dell for example has already refreshed the XPS line with intel panther lake and cut out the option for a dedicated gpu.,Neutral

Intel,Who said anything about basing the entire product stack around handhelds?,Neutral
Intel,"That's not quite right. Power levels are determined by the frequency of a given CPU core.

Intel,It's 10% faster geomean across 45 games,Positive
Intel,That can be resolved if either Intel or AMD decides to unlock quad-channel on consumer chips and mobos. It's artificial market segmentation; the die area needed to deliver more (LP)DDR5 channels is absolutely minuscule; for a huge boost in iGPU performance.,Neutral
Intel,Cache. Lots of it.,Neutral
Intel,"They are using 9600mt/s lpddr5x, could also have a lot of cache, (iirc 890m configs were nerfed in cache because they wanted to put a npu instead), and also could be a synthetic benchmark or specific game that isn't very bandwidth heavy.",Neutral
Intel,Panther Lake still has a 128 bit memory bus so only models with 9600 mt/s will get slightly faster shared memory bandwidth than Lunar Lake.   I wonder how this will manifest in games as the only performance leaks have been from Geekbench and 3DMark which may not be as bandwidth intensive as real games and applications.,Neutral
Intel,"This seems to be correct, since checking NotebookCheck for the 30 watt 4050 shows that it’s around 70% faster than the HX370 in games, which is roughly where Intel places their iGPU.  The performance difference between a 30 watt 4050 and full 140 watt 4050 is around 41 percent performance based on Time Spy",Positive
Intel,"basically cheating tho, rtx cards in dell laptops are barely getting enough watts to even turbo",Negative

Intel,"It’s a super strong generational gain though, it’s like the jump from Vega 8CU to rdna2 12CU. The kind of single gen gain you see once in 5 years at most",Positive
Intel,The thing about that... what sort of tile are we expecting them to package up? As you say if we can get 4050ish performance from an Intel iGPU then they really can't be far off 5050M... and maybe even 5060M performance in future.  Do you think they'll offer something like a 5070 tile? that almost seems excessive (and difficult to actually package from a thermal point of view in a laptop) but it seems like the 5050/5060 sort of tier is going to be pretty well covered as a traditional iGPU soon.,Neutral
Intel,AMD actually introduced lower tier Strix Halos in this CES; and the first budget laptop thats gonna use it is [the Asus TUF A14](https://youtu.be/h27w0PXFBgk?si=Pa7UQhinywF-uFMj&t=306),Positive

Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins. For all purposes it's an accounting trick to hide CCG's and DCAI's 5-15% operating margins if you divide the foundry losses per group revenue.",Neutral

Intel,"This is slightly splitting hairs but the 8c CCDs in Strix Halo is actually NOT the same chiplet as the ones in desktop zen 5 parts. It iirc is produced on a smaller node, slimmed down, and has different ( or no) TSVs.  It is similar to design and cache sizes to desktop however, but the changes to the CCDs were done to improve low power performance characteristics. They are likely a bit more expensive than Desktop CCDs.  I believe it is discussed in a chips&cheese deep dive.",Neutral
Intel,"AMD have largely been ""winning by doing nothing"" due to their better driver support stack for gaming on iGPUs, rather than actually throwing superior hardware at it.  It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.  Given how effective DLSS is on the Switch2, one could only imagine how kickass a Nvidia chip in a handheld PC could be with the far more ubiquitous DLSS support.",Neutral
Intel,Now they are not. The panther lake igpus are undisputed winners (excluding the 395+ from amd since it's just not gonna be mainstream). You can get a 358H or 368H and you'll have solid laptop for igpu gaming far cheaper than the 395+,Positive

Intel,"Well you said it, it's TSMC capacity, meaning also a priority issue. They prioritize AI over consumers and then increase the price by reducing availability, meaning the same chip costs more, meaning more margin.

A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.  Sorry for the rambling.",Neutral

Intel,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW? But yeah high end perf scaling falls apart at sub 4K internal res.",Negative

Intel,I feel like more people paying more attention since the market’s grown a lot.   I remember old games I played in the early 2000s having micro and regular stuttering depending on the game. I chalked it up to “huh guess it’s loading in data as I play” when I didn’t know much.,Neutral
Intel,We are paying more attention to it but I suspect as we push higher frames with new engines and techniques the micro stutter is getting worse. It just starts becoming less perceptible to people than say the micro stutter from SLI and other stuff that caused issues in the past.,Negative
Intel,"I think digital foundry answered that question on their podcast. Compared to 15 years ago the frame rate is higher on average for most gamers, but it also stutters more. So it's huge fps with huge drops and hangs.",Neutral
Intel,"Worth remembering no one even gave a shit about stuttering enough to measure it until someone at I think it was anandtech back in the late 00s was so fed up with shitty perf on his crossfire system he started doing 1% lows on benchmarks.   Back in the 90s people would run like 6x SLI voodoos and not even care that the game hitched every 10 seconds down to sub 30s fps lol...  Edit: it's also key to remember that a lot of the games that stutter on PC these days stutter in the exact same places for the exact same reasons, and worse considering the lack of CPU power, on consoles. Console gamers just don't give a fuck lol....   DF did a good video showing this truth with the Silent Hill 2 remake.",Negative

Intel,also more cause for stutering. Back then we could compile shaders real time with no siginficant issues because they were small. Now we have to compile shaders real time that are huge to the point where we pre-compile half of them before we even start the game.,Neutral
Intel,Console gamers *of certain genres* care.   The FGC rejected the idea of playing Street Fighter IV & MvC3  on PS3 because the Xbox 360 port had better input latency.   Even the PS4 port of USFIV wasn't liked.     Part of why I stopped going to tournaments is because SFV & Tekken 7 on PS4 always felt *off* compared to PC.,Negative
Intel,"Not really. In many cases, console versions of games just don't stutter whereas PC games do because modern games are mainly designed for consoles and then ported to PC.  A couple of good recent examples are Wukong and Outer Words 2. Neither of those games on consoles have the horrid stutters that are prevalent on PC.",Neutral

Plenty of content he could have farmed off that, especially BEFORE the RAM shortage where having an 8GB card was some sort of sin in his eyes (except for some reason he ignored it but raile roaded the cheaper RTX 5050, lol did someone say bias?). Instead, he just tore the 9060 XT 8GB down and never touched it again after that teardown. I'm sorry but there's GENUINELY stuff he could be doing instead of farming clicks about 'NVIDIA bad' and 'Intel pathetic', but that won't get him views from drama farming NVIDIA which is what he craves these days. So sad to see a big channel like his who got big off doing solid technical content become a drama-hype ""news"" channel.",Negative

Intel,"Geekbench’s scaling has always been problematic, and the differences between architectures are huge. The benchmark is very friendly to ARM and least favorable to AMD.

Intel,"Geekbench claims it's much more realistic than those multicore tests that scale nearly perfectly with tons of cores, and I think that's a fair take. It's not as if they didn't know how to create a benchmark that scales like other nT tests do, geekbench 5 nT does that.   I wouldn't call it worse, just different.",Positive
Intel,Geekbench runs common workloads as they are commonly implemented. It gives you a score on how well a multi core implementation of that workload would actually run in that CPU.   I think that is far more useful than some perfectly parallel workload measuring max power and core count.,Positive
Intel,"I have carefully compared the various models across Geekbench, PassMark, and the differences between Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake. If my judgment is correct, the theoretical peak performance of the 484 in Cinebench R23 should reach around **24,500**; the 285H scores **22,500**. Compared with the 285H, it should be easier for the 484 to achieve high scores because its power requirements are significantly lower than the previous generation built on TSMC N3B.  Its peak performance will not be extremely strong because the frequency is not high. IPC is likely improved by around **10–11%**, but clock speeds drop by about **6%**. Overall, that means single-core performance should only rise by **4–5%**.  The improvement will be most noticeable in Geekbench. Since PassMark single-core also shows gains, the IPC uplift and resulting single-core increase should be quite certain. If Geekbench were the only source, it would still be questionable, but PassMark is more solid and has higher reference value.  Overall, in terms of peak performance, the uplift is average—around **10%**, close to that figure.  However, the real key is the **efficiency gains**. I believe they will be excellent. Compared with the 285H, which requires **65 W** to reach **20,000** points in Cinebench R23, I estimate that the **388H** may only need **40–45 W**.  I also estimate that the Cinebench R24 score should fall around **1300–1400**. Compared with Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 at **1950**, there is still a significant gap—but the two products differ drastically in scale.  Overall, Panther Lake’s greatest achievements lie in several aspects:  1. **Energy efficiency** — likely the best among all x86 products. 2. **Performance per mm²** — excellent. For example, the 484: if you look at its die shot, the total area of the CPU (including the CPU tile’s 4P and 4 LPE cores and all caches) is essentially equal to the die area of a traditional monolithic 8-core design. That means the 484 uses the same silicon resources as past 8-core chips, yet **no AMD mobile 8-core processor surpasses it**, either in raw performance or efficiency. 3. It also offers better performance-per-area than Qualcomm’s processors. The X Elite 2 has **18 cores**, including **12 “very large” cores**—similar in size to Intel P-cores—and **6 large cores**, each larger than Intel’s E-cores. The die area of this chip is **2.5× larger** than Panther Lake 484’s.",Neutral

Second is the memory itself, they need something with higher bandwidth (but that might be addressed with LPDDR6).  To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.  Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.

Intel,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.  EDIT: 8060S (Strix Halo) is \~18,000 for reference.  EDIT 2: 890M (strix point's top end) about 8,100, so the PTL 12Xe chip will smoke that.

Well, we already had rumors of Intel struggling to hit actual intended frequency-goals, no?  Though especially the actual performance-metrics of the node will be quite sobering I think.  The power-draw of these SKUs is supposed to be a TDP of *officially* 25W – In reality, these parts are allowed to draw as much as 55W (2+0+4 or 4+0+4) and 65/80W (4+4+4 and 4+8+4) respectively.  So it must be seen, if these parts are any more efficient in daily usage, or just a side-grade to Lunar Lake.",Negative
Intel,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power. A 10-15% frequency advantage would go a long, long way towards closing gaps if it comes as a relatively small power cost.",Neutral

Intel,">I can't say I'm entirely sold on the idea of having three core clusters humming inside my laptop.  From a user's perspective, CPU's are a blackbox and the inner-working details are irrelevant. What matters is results. They want, typically, a balance of performance, battery life, heat / fan noise, and cost, placing greater emphasis on one of these categories over the others.  The idea is that P cores = performance optizied  E cores = Area optimized  LP-E Cores = power optimized.  The theory being to have different core types focus on different parts of PPA.  E cores and LP-E cores are the same microarchitecture. Just LP-E cores are off-ring so the ring (and rest of the cores) can be powered down in light-load scenarios.  Intel's biggest problem is that looking at each of the cores, the P cores perform their designated role the worst. 200% larger than E cores for \~10% more IPC and \~15% more clockspeed is a pretty rough trade off - and by the time you've loaded all P cores and need to load E cores too, that clockspeed difference diminishes hard.

With fewer thermal constraints and much higher power budgets, they should be able to push well past the perf/W peak, where it should continue to scale well and for a long time before it starts hitting severely diminishing returns.  I'm not talking 300W monster CPUs, but the scaling between a 65W and 105W 18A CPU should be more significant than on current nodes, where you might gain like 10-15% additional performance from that 50% power bump.

For that you'd want to look ahead to 14A where the CFO mentioned on the earnings call (and he was somewhat realistic in other areas so it's more believable here) that 14A has been a positive surprise and they're actually pretty excited about it.

They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them.

Every research report shows that demand for high-end GPUs is still strong. Steam HW survey shows the most popular GPUs are still mid-range gaming cards, showing that discrete GPUs remain central to the PC ecosystem.  And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",Neutral

Intel,"Start with setting up your PL1/2 for the capacity of your AIO. If it is set to standard, 4096W, you are going to have problems cooling that thing. Start with 253/253 standard Intel would be 125/253/304A and keep lowering that until there is no more thermal throttling. After that you can fine tune with undervolt etc.  And ofcourse check AIO mounting, pump, fluid.",Neutral
Intel,For both 12th and 13th gen you can do the following:  - turn hyperthreading off - enable only 8 ecores - Set a negative voltage offset of - 0.050  Play games for a couple of hours if no crashes then decrease offset by another 0.025 (I.e. 0.075). And keep going till you find the lowest voltage without crashes. This will increase 1% lows tremendously in games too.   Once you're stable and if temps are still too high (thermal throttle) then you can reduce clock speed by 100hz and keep doing it till you're happy. Reducing by 200mhz doesn't hurt gaming performance.  Benchmark a CPU limited game (or make it CPU limited by lowering the resolution) before you start so you can see the gains.,Neutral

Intel,"So the 9th gen is a bit of a weird CPU right now, you do have a couple of decent upgrade options, but also you cannot go past the 9th gen without a new motherboard. Also the 9th gen is quickly coming up on 6 years old now as well.   My affordable advice would be to grab a 9700k and a better CPU cooler, then you can start to worry about the GPU which is very PSU dependent anyways. Without knowing the PSU I cant really make a suggestion anyways.   But the truth is, I would almost start fresh. New mobo, cpu, PSU and GPU. It would be more pricy, but also a far better use of your money than dumping it into a system that will be too slow to run new games in just a year or two.",Neutral

Intel,"All the games you play avoid the problem of having a weak but modern gpu very well. Assuming you dont suddenly decide to play something more graphically intensive i reccomend upgrading your cpu seeing how it feels, then upgrading your gpu. The immediate option that comes to mind is the i5 9400f. It should be an approximate 25%-30% improvement in most of the games like cs2 due to the added cores, threads and clock speed compared to that fairly weak i3 cpu. Then you could do something like an RX 6600 for $120 if findable, if not I usually reccomend the 3060 12gb as a braindead midrange option still able to play anything, it's about 200.",Neutral
Intel,Get a 12th or 13th Intel i5 CPU and a decent GPU like the 5060 Ti or the 9060XT,Neutral
Intel,"What is your budget for upgrades?  Your GPU is currently being held back by your platform. The 6500XT only has PCIe x4, and LGA 1151 only has PCIe 3.0. 3.0x4 bottlenecks the card pretty badly, going from on par with an RX 580 to worse than an RX 570. Getting onto a newer platform with PCIe 4.0 would improve both your CPU and GPU.",Negative
Intel,"What you could/should upgrade depends entirely on budget. The CPU is nearly the slowest 9th gen Intel chip, so an upgrade there would help a lot. The ""Best In Slot"" CPU is the i9-9900K but those go for nearly $200 on eBay. You can find an i7-9700 for half that and while it's 50% faster multicore, it's only 10% faster single core and most games just use one or two cores, but there are exceptions: research which games you play to check. Fortnite and Arc Raiders can be CPU bound, so the i7-9700/K might help you out a lot with those games, or really any open world, multi-player type game. The GPU is also the slowest of the 6000 series. As far as new GPUs go, the Intel Arc B580 12GB at $250-$300 or the Radeon RX 9060XT 16GB at $380-$400 are best bang for the buck on the cheaper side, your options really open up on the used market. Go to the [Techpowerup specs page](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-6500-xt.c3850) and check out the Relative Performance of your card with faster ones. I would upgrade to something at least 200% relative performance or higher if you can afford it. Between the GPU and CPU, I'd say the GPU upgrade should take priority over CPU. While a much newer GPU might be bottlenecked by the 9100F, its vastly superior performance will leave the 6500XT in the dust. GTX 1080ti (\~$150) RTX 2080ti (\~240) RTX 3060ti (\~$220-250) RX 6750XT ($280-350) RX 6800 (\~$300) RTX 3080 (\~$350) all examples of decent used options that are considerably more powerful than the 6500.",Neutral
Intel,Adding a 9700K isn’t gonna fix the fact the GPUs being bottlenecked by PCIe 3.0.  An R5 3600 and a cheap B550 board would probably cost not much more than an 9700K and improve the GPUs performance quite a bit. It would still work with the 16GB DDR4 they already have.,Negative
Intel,I have seen many videos on how it is a bad card I haven’t had no problems so far but definitely on my list,Neutral
Intel,LGA 1700 isn’t worth recommending at all. DDR4 performance has aged terribly because newer games are more memory demanding. DDR4 boards have also gone up in price a lot.   HUB revisited the Ryzen 5000 series last week and included a 12400F on DDR4 and DDR5 for comparison (https://youtu.be/RijAyVshtok?si=NbuCRlSV4uhHOzlv) - the 12400F on DDR4 performs closer to an R5 5500 nowadays than the R5 5600 it used to compete with.,Negative

Intel,"What? A lot of the review coverage for the 6500XT was about how bad the PCIe bottleneck is. The 6400 and 6500XT are unique in that they’re PCIe x4, even current lower-end cards like the Arc B570 and RTX 5050 are PCIe x8  https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-pci-express-scaling/28.html TPU saw a 24% drop from 4.0 to 3.0 at 1080p  https://www.techspot.com/review/2398-amd-radeon-6500-xt/ Techspot saw a 22% drop in averages and 25% drop in lows from 4.0 to 3.0 at 1080p   I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s even worse nowadays, games demand more VRAM now than they did 4 years ago. More VRAM the card doesn’t have = higher PCIe bandwidth need = more bottleneck when you don’t have bandwidth  A cheap upgrade like an R5 3600 + B550 board would not only improve CPU performance substantially coming from an old 4c4t CPU, but give the GPU the PCIe 4.0 it needs.  If you don’t know what you’re talking about, don’t comment lol",Negative
Intel,"Yes, I’m not stupid.  You are far better off going for Zen 3 over anything on LGA 1700.   The R5 5600(X) performs as well with DDR4 as the 12400(F) does with DDR5.  Used they both go for ~$100-120, new both are ~$170 right now. AM4 boards tend to be cheaper and the RAM is the exact same.  Why would you spend more on LGA 1700 to get worse performance?",Neutral
Intel,"My real-world experience with low-end cpu power and this mismatch on those titles is 10%. It isnt worse than having that i3 does to cpu-bound situations. Upgrading a bad platform is probabaly not his best price to dollar, but it is the nuanced situation he's in. if he can sell what he has for the price it goes for, going ryzen is always correct. However his cpu and all the others here are bad. If he can simply get a better part price on a single chip, he can get equivalent value from the upgrade compared to going ryzen.",Negative
Intel,You can get an i5 13600k with better performance than a 5800x. Also it is difficult to find the AM4 X3D CPUs these days so the intel route makes sense. He can later upgrade to a 14900k even which no AM4 CPU can match in terms of performance,Positive
Intel,"Weren’t you recommending upgrading to a 9400F?  Sure, the 9100F might be the limiting factor right now, but you’re still gonna hit the same PCIe bottleneck. It’s just gonna be more pronounced.",Neutral
Intel,"13th gen pricing is crap so I’ll use 14th gen for comparison, it’s basically the same  14600KF is $245 new and $180-200 used. It has a 181W PL2 so you need a board with good power delivery to not throttle it, especially if you want an upgrade path. The cheapest DDR4 boards you can get right now that fit the bill are $140.  5800XT is $219 new and $150-170 used. AM4 boards are still cheap, there’s plenty of quality B550s for $100.  Going Intel over AMD would cost at least $60 extra and most of the performance gains you would see using DDR5 on the 14600KF would be wiped out using DDR4",Negative

Intel,"There is a high-end bias with this platform, like any. It helps a lot to understand that budget systems fall within their spec, it is only the highest-end and lowest-end options of this era that stretch the pcie issue... there are cycles of alarmist narritives in all media. That one is old news that likely shouldnt have been printed imo.",Neutral
Intel,You’re going to hit the large PCIe bottleneck the moment the CPU isn’t terrible. It’s not gonna take much of a CPU upgrade for a GPU worse than an RX 570 to become the issue.,Negative

Intel,Youre giving me nothing against the clear narritives youre following over substance of experience with this shitty level of cpu performance.,Negative
Intel,"Do you respect at all the starting position he is in or are u just an advice salesman? Both of our ideas coexist. selling his current pc for more than its worth and just buying a dirt cheap 2nd gen ryzen with a sane gpu for the same money, then upgrading from there is also perfectly correct. That is a similar level of effort to a platform swap, or whatever you would prefer, which is also correct. The only bad advice here wastes more time and money than his original choice of platform already sealed. Also ur just wrong about pcie bottlenecks im pretty sure",Neutral
Intel,"I’m making the reasonable assumption that the person running a 9100F + 6500XT in 2026 doesn’t have a ton of money to spend on upgrades lol  Upgrading the current platform makes no sense without also upgrading the GPU. You can’t get very far with CPU upgrades on an H310 board, anything higher than an i5 is gonna be throttled.   Swapping in a cheap PCIe 4.0 CPU + board like an R5 3600 + B550 will improve both the CPU and GPU performance while not spending a ton of money. It also opens the door to future upgrades to something like an R7 5800XT which will hold up far better with a GPU upgrade.   I gave you multiple reviews showing 20+% losses on PCIe 3.0. That’s not opinion, that’s fact. That loss is going to be the same regardless of how good or bad your CPU is as long as the CPU isn’t the bottleneck.",Negative
Intel,I genuinely wonder what u get living in the idealized world where pcie 3.0 sucks ass below the highest-end 4.0 products and visa-versa.

Intel,"Yea. Your advice is fine and wasnt the target of my statements, I added the last comment as proof I agree a platform swap is a totally good option. He doesnt even need to change his cooler for a 9400f and can then get a normal gpu for a similar value to his current one. This process is much simpler and has the potential to grant equal value if the chip is recieved for a low enough bargain, increasing the chances of finding a dreal given limited time. Do we disagree that we are both good at selling advice? I am still completely debating the validity of your sicituational understanding of pcie bottlenecks in relation to low cpu power circumstances, partially because of ur choice of sources, and ur disintrest in confronting that statement.

Intel,I have a 5600x and a 5070 and in 1440p it pairs very well. Im not 100% sure how well a 5600x would hold a 5070Ti but it should work good as well.  If you do upgrade to a 5070/5070Ti I would exclusively play in 1440p  The CPU usage in arc raiders is normal for our generation of CPU. Yes its bottlenecking but since your GPU is still high (80-95%) its not a hard bottleneck.   Also the difference from a 5600x to a 5800XT is like a 2% difference I would not waste money on a new CPU unless you can find a AM4 X3D for CHEAP.   Id do a 5070 and run it for a few years.

I think the Wraith Prism does the job but is just not the best, there are many better options for cheap.   I had my doubts with this cooler as it has very few reviews and is not a double tower. Most of the commonly recommended coolers (looking at you Peerless Assassin) weren't available here, and other popular ones didn't have enough clearance for the big heat sinks in my RAM sticks. The Wraith Prism barely fit.",Neutral
Intel,"CPU fan that came with it you mean the wraith cooler? It's not enough for the thing, other than being loud AF. Replace it with the Usual Thermalright dual tower be it the Frost 120, PA, Spirit whatever.",Negative
Intel,"Very strange, I used to run overclocked to 160W with a meduum sized tower cooler at lower temperatures than that.  Try running with the side of your case taken off.  Is your room really hot?  Get a friend to check your cooler install",Neutral
Intel,The other option to try is to restrict the wattage to 80 or 65w in bios effectively a 5700xt to see if that is manageable and performance acceptable,Neutral
Intel,"AMD stock heat sinks are absolute garbage, that’s the problem… even my 5600x with the stock cooler IDLES at 60c.. goes up to 84+ in stress tests. By comparison my old ass Cooler Master 212 Black edition on it runs at a cool 40c idle and never hits 65c. Had to swap back to stock cooler to put the 212 on my old AMD system to get it back up and running for server duty and remembered why I couldn’t stand the stock cooler. I have a new one coming from Amazon now.",Negative
Intel,It's because the stock cooler sucks,Negative
Intel,"Dude, 91C is pretty rough for a Ryzen! 😬 That stock cooler just isn't cutting it, man. If you're looking to lower temps, you might want to consider picking up a solid aftermarket cooler. Don't ask me where, though—I don't kiss and tell! Anyway, that's my PSA. Hope you cool dow...",Negative
Intel,Your stock CPU cooler is not good enough to keep the  temperatures low at high loads!,Negative
Intel,"The AMD stock coolers also use a two clip system this is finnicky/tricky to install. There is a much greater chance to install it incorrectly compared to aftermarket coolers that use screws.   For reference, I have both stock coolers and aftermarket coolers for both Intel and AMD chips. The stock coolers keep the CPUs in the low 30s'C at idle. The Wraith Prism is worse than aftermarket coolers, but should be keeping his cpu in the 30s'C at idle.   The only time I ever had idle temperatures as high as the OP (almost 50'C) was when I was new-ish to building PCs and incorrectly installed an Intel stock cooler that had 4 push pin clips and I didn't push them in all the way.",Negative
Intel,I second the phantom spirit 120 or the assassin x plus (dual stack version for this cpu).  You can get them for cheap. I wouldn’t recommend this for OP but I have an assassin x 120 digital (has an argb software temp readout) and that is only $20 rn but I am going to use it for my 5600x which is only 90 watts I think,Positive
Intel,My 5800x3d barely peaks 60* after hours of arc raiders gameplay using a peerless assassin cooler and mx5 paste. I do have an absolute wind turbine of a case though (lian li lancool 216) but a relatively quiet/efficient custom fan curve.,Neutral
Intel,Currently I am idling around 44-47C,Neutral
Intel,Agreed 💯! I've had a Thermalright Frozen Notte 240mm AIO on my 12600kf for over 2 years so far...overclocked to 5.3/4.2/4.5 @ ~1.31v and it keeps it below 90c even during y cruncher stress test loop.  For ~$50 USD it's hard to beat!,Positive
Intel,I've had a Montech AIO for almost a year now and it's been great,Positive
Intel,The 5800XT does ship with the Wraith Prism. The 5800X doesn't but the 5800XT does.,Neutral
Intel,"216 is such a beast, used that case for 4 of my friends builds i made for them in early 2024.",Positive
Intel,"Idle temps seem fine, so its probably not a mounting issue with the cooler, more then likely its not enough to cool down a 105W TDP CPU, I would recommend upgrading the cooler.  The stock Wraith Prism cooler is good but not enough for any CPU with a TDP or more then 65W especially in CPU demanding games such as Arc Raiders.",Neutral
Intel,Which CPU cooler are you using?,Neutral
Intel,"Your idle temperatures seem to be unusually high (unless your ambient temperatures/room temperature is very warm). What are your ambient temperatures? Have you tried reapplying fresh thermal paste and re-seating the cooler to make sure it is tightly strapped to the CPU?  The Wraith Prism is the best AMD stock cooler and should be able to handle the 5800XT just fine.  My Ryzen 3000s, 5000s, etc and my 88W-120W Intel chips with coolers better than, worse than, and equal to (literally the same HSF) the Wraith Prism all idle in the 20s-30s'C.  If everything ends up being fine and the cooler/heatsink is working as intended, then you can always just undervolt the 5800XT.",Neutral
Intel,Is the fans noisey when running that high?  I have a 240mm AIO from Corsair and the pump + fans are really noisey with stock settings if it get past 78c on a 12700k.  I'm thinking of just selling it and revert back to my previous dual tower air cooler.,Negative
Intel,"The Wraith Prism is the best of all the AM4/5 stock coolers (out of 4 of them) and should be able to handle 105w TDP CPUs just fine. It is the smaller Wraith Stealth and Spire that are for 65W cpus.  Wraith Stealth <<< Wraith Spire << Wraith Max < Wraith Prism.  The Wraith Prism came out with the 2700X, and that uses slightly more energy than the 5800X/XT (TPU shows \~175W for the 5800X and \~182W for the 2700X).  [https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-ryzen-7-5800x/19.html](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-ryzen-7-5800x/19.html)  His idle temps would be very high/unusually if his ambient temps are something like 70F/21C or lower. My Ryzen 3000, 5000, 5000X3D chips, etc 6 core and 8 core CPUs idled in the 30s'C (and even 20s'C when it was cooler), and my 88W 4790K increased to 120W was idling in the low 30s'C as well. This was with heatsinks better than, worse than, and equal to the Prism Wraith.",Positive
Intel,He says he used the boxed cooler. So a Wraith Prism.,Neutral
Intel,Just buy two Arctic P12 for $7 each and use those instead. I did that on my AIO and it dramatically improved both temps and noise.  Also you can probably run the pump at 70% without issues. Mine only ramps up to 100% at 80C.,Positive
Intel,"The fans max out at 2000 rpm, and wide open they're actually not that bad.  My PC is in my living room, and I can run Handbrake, Cinebench, etc and it doesn't interfere with watching TV or anything like that.  Of course there are quieter fans, and some people can tolerate noise better than others, but for the $$ spent, it's hard to beat.  I agree with the other reply, if you happen to get this AIO and the stock fans are too noisy for you, just swap them out with something from Arctic.  Also note, that the pump on the Frozen Notte is not PWM, so it runs at 100% at all times, but it's not noisy to me.",Neutral
Intel,"Also wanted to say that, if you want to customize your fan, download the program called FanControl and you should be able to lower the noise level.",Neutral
Intel,"My dual CCD 5800x (which runs about 5+C cooler than single CCD 5800x that have a fairly more warped IHS) wasn't kept in check by the wraith prism at all. Also the minimum RPM was like 1200 and it was loud as hell. While it's certainly the best stock cooler in recent production, it's completely useless against sub 50$ aftermarkets.",Negative
Intel,"I had money to spend so I got the new Corsair link and went ham on RGB. I spent some hours and had fun with different lights and themes.  It filled the itch and curiosity.  On spec, it seemed better than Arctic P12 (literally had P12 ARGB versions previously), but actual execution on cooling has been pretty disappointing. I had mines set to quiet, but course still hear pump noise.  If I ever do a next PC build, I prob go back to doing silent build again or a mini PC. Arctic P12 Pro is a much better design that addresses issues the original P12 had.  Though I am curious about Thermalright TL-12 performing better at lower RPM range than Arctic P12s.",Positive
Intel,"I have the Wraith Prism in one of my systems and I can barely hear the fan unless I really stress the CPU. I moved it into my HTPC to watch movies and play games and it is basically inaudible during quiet movie scenes.    It certainly would lose to any $50 aftermarkets. It would lose out to even a cheap $35-$40 Thermalright. However, it should still be perfectly sufficient to run a 105W cpu like a 2700X or 5800X.   The fact that his 5800X idles at 47'C suggests something is wrong with the cooler, TP, or the installation. A 5800X at idle consumes about the same power and gives off the same heat as the 5600X, 3600X, 5800X3D, 5700X3D, and 5700X. I've had almost every single one of these CPUs and my chips all ran in the high 20s 'C to low 30s 'C idle with ambient temps of around 21-25.5'C (70 to 78'F).",Negative
Intel,What issues did the original P12 have?,Neutral
Intel,"Or maybe it's the case (and it may explain the higher idle temp), there are a few revisions of the prism that had a lower RPM minimum threshold, mine was stuck at an obnoxiously high minimum RPM that made it loud and clear. In fact a few days later the Be Quiet DRP4 finally came and I got rid of the prism, but I'm quite picky with fan noise",Neutral
Intel,"I used P12 in various build for years. It's my go to.  The only problem is bearing noise after a year, even after cleaning.  My last build was strictly be quiet case fans mad had been quiet since then.",Neutral
Intel,Even after they switched to FDB? My P12s have been whisper quiet for a couple years now.,Negative
Intel,"I think your whisper quiet is my ""noisey"" lol.  When I had the P12 ARGB, that one is based on P12 Pro, did not exhibit noise.   Before my full $$$$ Corsair RGB build, I always had what I call ""dead silent"" builds. Like the computer would be 2nd or 3rd noisiest thing in the room even while gaming. Not the fast CPU and GPU, but can still have a high performance.  My haswell build 10 years ago had a large CPU heatsink no fan.  The original P12 has always had a balance issue when standing vertical position. If ran for 4 hours a day daily, after a year, I can hear the noise would increase and be a really faint bearing noise.  This is NOT an issue with P12 ARGB and P12 Pro as they have a revised fan design and I would totally recommend them over the original P12.   As for me thinking about Thermalright and Be Quiet, that is mainly to get the most amount of airflow with least amount of sound possible. I have seen YouTube videos of guys testing these at 800rpm and 1000rpm tests and Arctic is usually behind those fans (not a large margin, but still great on price per performance).",Neutral
Intel,"i mean from what i know it think it’s good, honestly if you’re looking for those graphics i would say maybe a better gpu and possibly cpu, make sure to double check that you have access to ethernet to where you are in your home otherwise you’ll need a wifi motherboard. the ram might be an issue for some games and also you most likely won’t need that much storage, my 2tb (lol tb) storage fits me just fine with having multiple games in the hundreds like red dead. also if you’re upgrading see how much storage takes up with different games which can give you an estimate of how much or just count all the games haha. otherwise i think you’re fine",Positive
Intel,"Stay way from AsRock AM5 motherboards (they fry AMD CPUs). 7600X is a better CPU for a similar price. That GPU is not a good idea (expensive, old and low VRAM).

Intel,I have router on shelf right next to me that connected to laptop so internet wont be a problem (I still gonna buy the wifi adapter tho). Two of my feinds have 16GB of RAM and they play games that I listed above (and the others) more than fine. I will still of course upgrade my RAM in the future. I chose RX 6600 XT cuz I heard that it was good card with powers between 3060 and Ti. Def gonna upgrade it. And I chose 7500F because I think its a good start for a mid pc on AM5 probably gonna keep it for the longest  P.S Yeah I think im gonna buy smaller HDD but I want to start study video editing and modeling so I might still get 4TB.,Positive
Intel,the asrock motherboards are more or less fine now and it was mainly x3d chips that were the issue but they released bios updates and it should be fine now and they are great cheap motherboards with decent features,Positive
Intel,"Option 1 is definitely the way to go, you'll get so much better performance boost for your money.  While an X3D chip would be nice, they are in short supply and incredibly expensive for what you get.  Edit: You can also use DLSS on the 3070 to play games at 4K on the TV. It should look a lot better.",Positive
Intel,"For gaming purposes I think option A makes the most sense. The 5600x is a good cpu still, and you’ll see bigger performance upgrades all around this way. That’s in terms of FPS for games if what you want is maybe more performance for desktop applications then maybe go B or consider am5 for one of them.",Positive
Intel,Buy a 5070ti for your pc and put the 3070 inside yourgf's PC,Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, CPU is fine on both. I’d look into the 9070 upgrade.",Positive
Intel,"Option 1. I don't think you should bring hunting down and overpaying for an X3D CPU. Staying with AM4 is about cost savings, not hunting a rare jewel and spending a fortune.",Neutral
Intel,"Rig 1 doesn't need an upgrade imo.  Rig 2 yeah the GPU maybe could size however I imagine you still okay fairly well on it anyway.  Option 1 makes the most sense of the two. You both get an upgrade with only needing one purchase.  That said, nowt wrong with a 3070 at all, specially for the use case.  Upgrade rig 2 to a 3070 if you can find one could be the cheaper option, but only one rig gets the upgrade.  So back to option 1 so you both get the upgrade feel.",Positive
Intel,"Option A and call it good. You'll have a hard time finding AM4 X3D, and by the time that you do, it'd be cheaper to go AM5 because scalpers gonna scalp. Also, going to a 3060 or 3060 Ti is a waste of money at this point. You'd be better off going to an RX 9060 XT 16GB instead of RTX 3060/3060 Ti.  Truthfully though, I'd look for a Ryzen 5 9600X and B650/B850 combo with RAM, and then go to a 9070 XT for your first. You can do a combo builder on Newegg and get CPU, mobo, and 32GB of RAM for $678 USD. Add an 850W PSU like an Montech Century II for 90 bucks, and you're laughing. At very least, it'll give your 3070 a bit more room to stretch its legs.  In saying that, Maybe sell off your other rig, and use it to offset the cost of a 9070 XT. Then, you can use your primary as your secondary. You can cheap out on a case for it and re-use your current one for the new stuff. Montech's X5/X5M are dirt cheap, look good, and give plenty of airflow. The included fans are SATA and non-PWM, but they're not noisy enough to be a pain, and they have a regular 5V ARGB header.  I just did a build in the X5M with a 9600X and 9060 XT 16GB, and the max temps with a Montech NX400 cooler(also dirt cheap) in that case under a 1-hour all-core stress test was 72°C. It's a definite recommend to save money on any build without sacrificing airflow...and it has USB-C on the front I/O",Neutral
Intel,Do you live near a microcenter?,Neutral
Intel,"Upgrade 1 will give you more fps because of the faster gpu, and with a gain of 10-15% from a 5800x to x3d with a 5090 at 1080p low, (hardware unboxed video yesterday) I´d rather opt for a search for a used cheap 5800x to add some clocks and  2 cores to your main system  Upgrade 2 will do nothing for the first system and you get a new gpu for the second one.",Positive
Intel,"Exactly this.  At 1440p and especially at 4k, it is the GPU that is doing most of the heavy lifting.  BUT, I always recommend that you use Adrenaline or some other hardware monitor to see what the utilization of both the CPU and GPU is during game play where you think you could benefit most from better performance.  That will tell you what component is maxing out and should be upgraded first.",Neutral
Intel,"Or...sell off Rig 1 and do the AM5/9070 XT build and keep Rig 2 and upgrade the GPU later. The reason that I say go AM5 9600X, is because it performs close to AM4 X3D chips in most games...sometimes better.",Neutral
Intel,unfortunately i am no where near an MC,Negative
Intel,Appreciate your thoughtful input. I wasn’t aware of the  closeness in performance of AM5 9600x vs  AM4 x3d. I’ll do some more research on that front.  For now I’m leaning towards getting just a 5070ti now and waiting another year or so to upgrade rig 1 to AM5.,Neutral
Intel,Boo ok was going to say it would be cheaper to buy a mobo combo than upgrade to an x3d on AM4 those are getting pretty expensive used.,Neutral
Intel,"Hardware Unboxed did a 5800X3d/5700X3D revisit the other day, most of the time, it was within 5-7% of them in games.",Neutral
Intel,"considering rampocalypsis  if u can get an 5700x3d or 5800x3d (dont know if ali express still are), and maybe a 9060xt or 5060 (16gb both of them) u can get a nice upgrade that will last a few more years, at least untill the rampocalypsis finish and u can do a proper upgrade ( if u wanted a more powerfull GPU i would suggest buying a new PSU)  and even with the rampocalypsis, maybe u are interested in a new pair of 8Gb ram stiscks ddr4 and bump the ram up to 32Gb",Positive
Intel,"Sell your old PC. Then buy a new one if you get a reasonable price, especially for RAM that can easily take most of your budget for DDR5 32 gb.",Neutral

Intel,"Honestly I've spent about 448 euro to upgrade my girlfriends 2600x and GTX1660 super to a 5800x and RTX 5060, night and day difference and she can pretty much play anything modern again at 60-144fps depending on the game with decent settings.  I'd get a decent 750 watt PSU with a 5070Ti and you'll still have money left for a 5800x3D if you can find one. That alone sounds like a better long term deal than settling for a 5070 instead.  Sidenote: why is your post written with AI?",Positive
Intel,I'd upgrade it alltogether. In my opinion if you want to upgrade cooling/storage it's fine but if you get into gpu/cpu territory it's not that worth it because upgrading a cpu is limited to what your mobo is compatible with. Besides when you want significantly more performance you'd upgrade the mobo with cpu then you think you want a better gpu and you will end up with an entirely new pc at the end but you will blueball yourself with performance along the way so it's best to build/buy a new one once and have it behind you.,Neutral
Intel,"for upgrade gpu lead to need more cpu power too, should consider cpu in am4 system that can match with 5070ti",Neutral
Intel,I'd rather buy or build a new pc.,Neutral

Intel,"I've previously upgraded the GPU (970 to 4070) in an older system (5820K from 2014) and was happy with the improvement. I wanted to buy a GPU whilst they were easily available, and affordable to me, so I ordered a 4070 FE on release day in April 2023, to pair with a new 4K VRR-capable monitor. My intent was always to take it with me to my next system, which I eventually did in November 2025.  Whilst I probably didn't get every ounce of performance out of it whilst it was in that 5820K system, it was still a massive improvement, and necessary for making good use of the 4K monitor.  I should note, however, that my old system already had a capable 850W PSU. If I'd had to upgrade the PSU, I likely would not have bothered, as I find recabling a labour-intensive job that I'd rather not do.  In your place, I think your 450W PSU restricts you, unless you feel very differently to me about upgrading it. I wouldn't upgrade the GPU to anything needing much more than the 1070Ti's 180W, which would limit you to a 5060Ti or 9060XT which should both offer about a 2x improvement. You may feel that you'd rather pay a bit more and get a far more capable GPU, with a bit more headroom, however.",Positive
Intel,Prebuilt PC specs? If it's on am5 with 32gb of RAM that's likely the best choice.  What resolution and refresh rate is your monitor?,Positive
Intel,Absolutely getting the prebuilt. Sell the old if you want to recoup some of the cost.  You can move the old HDD into the prebuilt if it doesn't come with one (as I assume it doesn't),Neutral
Intel,"""I’ve always upgraded my old PC piece by piece"" This is always a bad idea and it just means you didn't build a well balanced PC, but rather that some components were big overkill, so you had headroom to upgrade other components that were the wrong choice initially.   Always save money until you can buy entire new PC, and build it so well with components of similar relative power so that any upgrade would make no sense. That's how you make the most for your money, get the most performance and it also eases up selling/gifting old PC as a bonus.  So always the answer is buy entire PC (either pre-built which is nowadays a decent option, or all components needed separately and build it yourself), now whether you can find satisfactory PC for your budget is something only you know, but worst case scenario just save up more money if you need better PC - but always buy at once everything.",Negative

Intel,"What is ""budgeting"" in this context? And yes, there is something wrong with upgrading as you go, and I explained why. It means PC was not built to be balanced, relative power of components didn't match eachother, you had big bottlenecks as long as there is headroom for meaningful upgrade (meaning you never saw the full potential of your CPU because GPU was too bad for it, if you have the headroom to upgrade just GPU).  If you have the ability to meaningfully upgrade some component - it means you picked the wrong components in the 1st place, and wasted money on those overkills for no reason, since you were limited by worse components so you could never enjoy them. By the time you get to upgrade one or two components - you'd be better off if you saved money for entirely new PC cos now you can get for the same cost newer components that you picked as overkill. You get the idea.  Upgrading ""as you go"" is wrong, sorry. It means your PC was not well built and that you either overspent for some components (if they are overkill and leave headroom for other components to be upgraded) - or underspent for those weaker ones.",Negative
Intel,"You're delusional, bottlenecks aren't a thing out of the extremes and purely dependent on what you do with the system.  The 'headroom for upgrade' comes from hardware manufacturers, not your system being 'unbalanced'.  You are objectively wrong, and I'm going to tell you why in the case of upgrading CPU + GPU:  * End cost is \*the same\* * You get increased performance while waiting to afford the other part * More time spent with higher performance  The only counterpoint from here is you providing evidence that running an ""unoptimal"" system is harmful to the hardware.  edit: Fantastic argument, I thoroughly enjoyed our conversation :-)  edit2: Blocking actually isn't a great look although it can personally save you some dignity when things get uncomfortable.

Got destroyed in an argument so you start insulting?  I wouldn't say calling someone ""delusional"" for providing ignorant statements would be considered an insult  >If you've waited for the next gen(s) to buy entire new PC, you can either buy one category below of similar performance for less money, or the same category for same money would result in even better component cos it's newer. Argument dismissed.  Obviously, performance gets cheaper as time goes on, I don't really know what this is supposed to mean. You can absolutely go from a Ryzen 5 3600x - RTX 2070 build to an RTX 5070 and buy a 5600x a month later for an example.  >7600X vs 9800X3D, with RTX 3060 GPU both will be **the same** \- no increased performance. Money wasted. Argument dismissed.  Correct! I don't think I made any statement to the contrary, that falls under my ""out of the extremes"" and ""dependent on use-case"" comments I made! :)  That would result in no performance increases in gaming.  As a reminder, the poster is planning to upgrade his GPU and he will see massive increases across the board compared to his 1070 Ti. Can you provide evidence to support that switching from the 1070 Ti to a 5070 Ti would result in lower fps, freezes and stutters?",Negative
Intel,"""You're delusional, bottlenecks aren't a thing out of the extremes and purely dependent on what you do with the system.""   \- Why do you insult? Got destroyed in an argument so you start insulting?      ""The 'headroom for upgrade' comes from hardware manufacturers, not your system being 'unbalanced'.""    \- Incorrect. Argument dismissed.  ""End cost is the same""    \- False. If you've waited for the next gen(s) to buy entire new PC, you can either buy one category below of similar performance for less money, or the same category for same money would result in even better component cos it's newer. Argument dismissed.  ""You get increased performance while waiting to afford the other part""    Lie. Since you are bottlenecked by the worst part, and unless it's a GPU it's an ugly bottleneck too, not just resulting in reduced FPS, but if it's CPU one it could be stutters/freezes too. Unless it's all balanced you will not get better performance. Plastic example: 7600X vs 9800X3D, with RTX 3060 GPU both will be **the same** \- no increased performance. Money wasted. Argument dismissed.  ""The only counterpoint from here is you providing evidence that running an ""unoptimal"" system is harmful to the hardware.""   What are you on about? Lol.  I thoroughly enjoyed destroying you, now begone.",Negative
Intel,"Destroyed you in the argument, sorry.",Negative
Intel,"Fair enough, destruction noted! :>  \*remark about making sure to answer questions and giving more context behind own thought processes for the sake of clearer understanding in a mutual conversation\*",Neutral
Intel,"Sorry, I didn't really want to destroy every single word you said, but I had to cos it was all so incorrect. You are dismissed now",Negative
Intel,"If you are upgrading CPU (presumably to a 5000 series?) then B580 is probably the best option, but you need to make sure that your motherboard supports Resizable Bar otherwise performance will be bad.  Otherwise I'd probably take the 5050.",Neutral
Intel,At those prices arc b580 is the only thing that really makes sense. Any more options for used cards like a 7600/ 6600xt etc?,Neutral
Intel,"Get the Intel B580 12GB, it's drivers are more stable now as compared to before. Nowadays you don't want an 8GB GPU. Bad idea in 2026.",Negative
Intel,"Have had my B580 since mid-Dec 2024, and have had no issues because of the games played, and it is also paired with a Ryzen 5 5600. Aside from the RX 6600, what are other AMD options available to you that maybe at the 400$ mark since that is your budget for the 5050...?",Positive
Intel,Get some RTX 3080 10/12 gb and don't fuck my brain.,Negative
Intel,Might be a dumb question but what is a resizable bar? and also how do i check if my motherboard has it,Neutral
Intel,i dont really want to get used cards but i found used 7600 for 230$ (8gb) and used 6600 for 250$,Negative
Intel,good to hear,Positive
Intel,the AMD 500 series gpus has their support ended and the other decent ones are above my budget if i get a new one and i dont wanna buy used ones,Negative
Intel,shit is 650$ in my country way out of my budget,Negative
Intel,"It's a setting in your motherboard BIOS. [Here is Intel's support article](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090831/graphics.html) about it. It is basically required to get the expected performance from Intel GPUs, but having it available as an option was something introduced around 2019, not all older motherboards have it.  Your board might also not have it right now, but if you update the BIOS (which you need to do for a new CPU anyway) that might add support for it.",Neutral
Intel,Yeah neither of those is really worth it over the 580 imo unless your board doesn't support rebar as other commenters have pointed out. If that ends up being the case i really think the 7600 used might be the best option.,Negative
Intel,So nothing newer than the RX 6600?  And what is your mobo and PSU?,Neutral
Intel,GIGABYTE GA-A320M-S2H motherboard and 500w psu,Neutral
Intel,"There are multiple revs of that mobo model. If resizeable bar (or whatever Gigabyte calls it) is currently not available in your BIOS version, you may need to incrementally update BIOS (and you may need to do it all the way to the most recent). Check after each update; the Gigabyte site is showing that incremental updates are necessary...read the notes.  500W PSU will limit your GPU options. What is/are the PCIe connector(s) available from that PSU?",Neutral
Intel,"I replied a bit late but i just updated my BIOS to the latest version, i will check if theres a resizeable bar in my motherboard. My PICe connector is 2 + 6 connector i think",Neutral
Intel,"If rebar exists, then you have 50 watts to spare and the connector for the ARC B580 aside from the overhead that may be there with the 1600...",Neutral
Intel,so should i go for it? even if i dont have rebar (i still didnt check it its 1 am) i will upgrade my cpu in a month,Neutral
Intel,ok i just checked it and it does have rebar,Neutral
Intel,Then the overhead issue with the Ryzen 5 1600 is the remaining concern...and that may be game dependent.,Neutral
Intel,DDU ?,Neutral
Intel,You shouldn't be getting worse performance at all. Did you run DDU to uninstall your old Nvidia drivers? Often switching from Nvidia to AMD and vice versa can cause issues like this.,Negative
Intel,most shooter games rely on cpu and your running a 2018 cpu with a 2025 gpu not really a big problem just prob being bottlenecked you also may be running arc raiders with nvidia settings while using a amd card,Neutral
Intel,"You're cpu bottlenecked. You can increase graphics settings. This won't increase your fps, but it might improve stutters and it will give you free graphics improvements.",Neutral
Intel,Is the GPU at 100% utilization?  Are you vram limited?,Neutral
Intel,"yes, nothing change after DDU or Windows Reinstall",Neutral
Intel,"i already trying this too, same FPS on LOW and EPIC",Positive
Intel,"You can also set a fps cap, lower it a bit until you no longer see stutters.",Neutral
Intel,fps cap can't help because FPS are going to 45 to 70 to fast,Negative
Intel,Then you just need to set it low enough. Otherwise you'll keep facing stutters.,Neutral
Intel,you must have some huge hands judging from the apparent size of that box,Neutral
Intel,"Holy shit my hands look like a giant Hold on ill get you a pic with me actually holding the BOX, not the gpu.  https://preview.redd.it/kkndv19xh1dg1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=924d6b75377cecc6a98ac1bae1a765b4349dc025",Negative
Intel,"yes, but choose the b580 instead (though it has 12gb of VRAM), also id recommend the rx 9060xt 16gb",Positive
Intel,Get the B580 in my opinion,Neutral
Intel,Had the a770 LE loved it! Wasn’t very powerful considering the specs but it was nice to see Intel actually putting effort in the Gpu space. I would personally go with the B580,Positive
Intel,Yup. Also does media processing very very good.,Positive
Intel,"CPUs don't support resizable BAR, devices do. Arc cards don't require resizable BAR it's just expected to be used.",Negative
Intel,"Rebar isn't needed for Arc gpus to function, but it is needed for them to function as intended. I believe Arc does need a motherboard with a UEFI bios, but could be wrong on that.",Neutral
Intel,You can look up compatibility on the PC builder site.   I got a Z790 for 125$   I got the I5-14600Kf for 150$   It holds up really nice.  BE REALLY CAREFUL the Intel GPUs need REBAR so keep your eyes peeled for that.,Positive
Intel,"Must be nice to have a MC, my closest is a few thousand miles away.",Positive
Intel,intel 13th and 14th gen have cpu failures so only buy if you are willing to risk that,Negative
Intel,Totally forgot about the rebar. Thanks for the reminder. My current cpu and mobo support rebar and I have it activated. Definitely something I’ll have to consider when I upgrade to ddr5,Positive
Intel,Would 12600kf for 100 be good?,Neutral
Intel,A few thousand miles? Sorry that sucks. Their bundles/combos on parts are better than sex sometimes.,Negative
Intel,I mean.. CPUs are pretty far ahead of GPUs at least in terms of gaming.   Unless you planned on running 1440 with everything on ultra the B580 is great on most games. You’ll never feel like you are forced to run a game on low graphics.,Positive
Intel,If you plan on investing in Intel GPUs I would press you to get the newest gen.   Intel ARC B580 which is an entry Intel GPU didn’t play nice with older Intel Chips   12600 would hold up just fine.,Positive
Intel,Thanks there’s also the brand new core ultra 5 225f with bf6 for 150 on amazon. Would ultra core be a better fit?,Positive
Intel,If you don’t plan on upgrading it’s fine but if Intel releases a newer card that more powerful it might get bottlenecked.,Neutral
Intel,Dang maybe am5 cpu is better,Positive
Intel,I’d say to go AMD.   Intel royally fucked up in that race but since they did have a major price drop because of it I scooped one up cheap.,Negative
Intel,"I know this may sound a weird, but I would wait six months before doing any additional work to your system.  It looks fine, great even, and hopefully it’s meeting your needs… but it’s worth using it for a few months to help better determine what works, what doesn’t, what you’d like to change, etc.  There’s always a weird period for me after a build where it’s like… “great, now what?”, “what project should I do next?”.  You may be experiencing this.",Positive
Intel,"tyvm for this reply! At this point im not thinking on ""upgrading"" any further. But i do feel that im missing out ""quality"" wise, when it come to the ingame quality.  Let me use ArcRaiders as an example, first time ever running a recent tittle in EPIC quality. but still feels grainy, but im realy not sure if its related to the monitor, (can provide model when i get home), it's connected with DP.  Right now im very much pleased obviously, and hearing that it looks fine, probably the only thing i might be buying is indeed a monitor cuz currently im just using one. and for what i hear you dont buy a second monitor, you buy a better new one and use the current as the 2nd.",Neutral
Intel,"You’d need twice the ram, a way newer cpu for 200fps in anything modern, sure cs, valo and Fortnite will run 400fps on a 7500f or 14600k cpu which cost 130$/190$ respectively with the first being upgradable and the second one being able to use ddr4. But anyways you’d 100% need a new mobo. For 1080p you’d also want at least 12gb of vram for future titles but some shit show games like borderlands 4 or escape from tarkov are just so unoptimized your lucky to get 90fps in those. Normal games like cyberpunk with normal settings or the new battlefield will give you around 150-200fps but it’s tricky in the newer engines to consistently hit high fps with very realistic graphics.   So TLDR: you need to change everything anyways. Currently building is bad due to ram shortages and GPUs went up last week all 50-100$ already due to vram shortages. So get yourself a decent prebuilt. 7800x3d if doable and 5070 or 9070 should be great and doable around 1800$",Neutral
Intel,"The only thing you can save is your ssd, which is tiny and I guess can be used for your system install.",Neutral
Intel,"Great answer, thank you.  Worth it to even try to sell my current rig on marketplace or just keep it as a second setup?",Positive
Intel,"It’s still decently worth something 250$ if it looks good should be fair and gone quite quickly. Maybe a bit more if you have time. If that enables a better purchase I’d be extremely inclined to do it since prices now are high but the prebuilt options I mentioned or the one you said are very capable so you don’t „need“ to get something even better, it’s more of a „if you want it it’s not gonna hurt“ as you can keep the pc longer",Positive
Intel,lol old skool,Neutral
Intel,"Personally I think the fps jump is worth it, I prefer higher fps over better looking games, the rtx 2060 will make the games look way better for sure, but you will feel a jump in responsiveness from 144 fps, specially based on the fact that you play cs and Fortnite, since shooters are games that feel the best with high refresh rate.",Positive
Intel,how much does a gpu cost for you? I think 144hz IPS monitor would be much cheaper,Neutral
Intel,Fps doesn't matter if your monitor doesn't show it.  Have your dad buy the more expensive one and you save money for the cheaper one.,Neutral
Intel,Monitor would be better value,Neutral
Intel,"i think the monitor would be smth like 400PLN (94EUR/$110) and the GPU i could be looking for would be 600-700PLN, but that doesnt matter that much, im just thinking what would be better value, an old gpu with 144hz, which would be useful only in some esport games (bc its too weak to play SP on good settings on >60 frames) or a new gpu with a old 60hz monitor so the extra frames wouldnt change anything",Neutral
Intel,"i told him to buy a monitor cuz its gonna be at least few months till i could buy a gpu, so i could use higher refresh rate meanwhile and the price difference wasnt that bad (600pln for the gpu arc a750 and 400 for 144hz ips monitor)",Neutral
Intel,"yea, i think im gonna buy that for now",Neutral
Intel,"I see that you are from Poland, you can find good deals on monitors here: https://www.pepper.pl/grupa/monitory   And other things like GPU or anything really, Pepper is a neat site, kind of like reddit but you upvote or downvote deals other users find.",Positive
Intel,"I think monitor would be better, if you already hit 60 fps in SP games you would get no smoothness improvement from a new gpu     gpu should be your next upgrade though",Neutral
Intel,"yea, i was thinking just like you, so im gonna buy a monitor for now (some budget Philips E-Line 24E2N1110/00 for 279pln) and look for some intel arc a750 in the near future, you think its a good idea or i should look for smth else?",Neutral
Intel,"Not sure about budget monitor market tbh, might wanna make a separate post on this (or other) sub, idk if its allowed to ask about this here  include your country btw when asking for recommendations  just look for 144hz ips 27'' or 24'', chinese is fine",Neutral
Intel,Maybe the psu is a little light for the system? If the gpu can draw 225w and 65w for the cpu. That’s already around 300w. With fans and MB added to the wattage it could be too much for the power supply to provide.,Neutral
Intel,Are your graphic drivers up to date?  If so the next thing I would check is your power draw.,Neutral
Intel,change your hdd or ssd,Neutral
Intel,"I set it up so the GPU draws 180w from the PSU, and the PSU is probably not the problem because the game ran smoothly at 100+ FPS on the Legacy version",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah they are, i did a clean install this time wich means every old driver i didnt delete got deleted, still didnt fix it, i think the PSU isnt the problem because GTA online on the legacy version ran at 100+ FPS in high settings",Negative
Intel,No,Neutral
Intel,Why not buy a cheaper gpu?,Neutral
Intel,How would that make anything better ?,Negative
Intel,You’re not allowing the GPU to run at its full engineered potential (waste of money/starving the GPU of power it needs to run enhanced version). Then complain about graphical issues and studders while using an underpowered PSU. That’s the problem.,Negative
Intel,"Ik my psu is bad i just dont have the money for it, i was looking for temporary fixes",Negative
Intel,When you get a stronger PSU change ALL power supply cables too.  Even the same brand of PSU can be pinned differently and it can potentially fry part/all of your system. At least legacy works good so that’s better than nothing. 😋,Neutral
Intel,mmmm if your Dell doesnt support Resizeable BAR I wouldn't bother with Intel ARC. It's a requirement to get useable performance out of them.,Negative
Intel,"Yeah that was the original intent before it got fried. Pulled the cmos out to see if I can reset the bios and get it moving. Otherwise I’ll try those methods, thanks!",Neutral
Intel,"It’s got resizable bar support, but apparently I did something wrong along the way because this thing boots straight to that by the time my monitor is up and running",Negative
Intel,Which model is it?,Neutral
Intel,"5680, cpu should support it as should the bios if my prior research came up right.",Neutral
Intel,I really dont think a PC from 2018 supports Rebar. I could be wrong though.  Maybe you could try booting with the integrated GPU and go from there.,Negative
Intel,"I tried that option, but the only integrated option was a display port. Wouldn’t have thought that’d be an issue, but my monitor hits me with a “display disabled, reset computer” screen",Negative
Intel,"Update, unplugged the arc and went for the display port. It’s not as fucked but still hardly booting",Negative
Intel,"Just a FYI resizable base address register has been a thing since PCIe 3.0 was released in 2010.  The real question is if the BIOS has the settings or not.  RebarUEFI can add support for pretty much any UEFI based system but it isn't easy to get working properly. Back when I was looking into using RebarUEFI for an el cheepo system I discovered that AMD's ""Smart access memory"" is based on REBAR but with improvements.",Neutral
Intel,My z370+8600k supports reBAR no problem,Positive
Intel,"I've recently tried Bazzite and went back to Windows 11 because Battlefield 6 doesn't work due to the anti-cheat problem on Linux (not just Bazzite, all distros).   Apart from this, it looks fine, runs fine. It takes a bit to get used because the GUI is different from Windows, but it's not an issue.  \-------------  The following I haven't tested, just read from others: Linux favors a lot AMD because of the open source nature of their drivers compared to nvidia which don't work as well: not optimized I think.   \-------------  The anti-cheat issue, constant AMD push, not all games and apps (for example DaVinci: it's not enough to just run, but it needs to run the same way as in Windows, or you search for an alternative and learn that) run on Linux vs Windows, the philosophy that you can run only the apps the Linux world or cult allow you to run have made me return to Windows 11, which is not perfect, but I can use whatever HW I want and run what games I want. It's my PC and I can use it how I want it.   Best thing to do is try it for yourself and see how it goes.",Neutral
Intel,"Make sure the games u want to play are supported. Otherwise, stick to Windows.  [https://www.protondb.com/](https://www.protondb.com/)",Neutral
Intel,I have and I succeeded. I use cachyOS and NixOS,Positive
Intel,CachyOS 😉,Neutral
Intel,"As far as I saw, Nvidia does definitely better on windows. I would like to have at least the same performance. I knew AMD does better, so I moved my rog ally to steamOS and it's great and even the desktop mode is easy to figure for day to day tasks. It's a good trend, it's progressing so hopefully at a point it will be a viable solution for all hardware.",Positive
Intel,Since you are installing os from scratch this is the perfect opportunity to try Linux. I'm not sure steam os plays with nvidia. I would recommend Mint.   Keep in mind some games will not work ie) BF6. Non of these games are worth keeping windows imho but they may be important games for you.,Positive
Intel,"Bazzite works but it depends on having supported hardware. I tried it, liked it, and reinstalled windows due to horrible intel ARC support.   TLDR try it, it's nice, but may not work. I've heard that AMD hardware works great.",Positive
Intel,New dlss isnt for the 20 and 30 series.  Its a drastic performance cut.,Negative
Intel,"SteamOS requires a full AMD build (CPU and GPU). There are other, non-Valve, Linux distros that can provide a similar experience on a wider range of hardware.",Neutral
Intel,I’ve done both SteamOS and Bazzite. It’s why I only get AMD GPUs. I feel like they’re about 90% there. I went back to Windows because it’s just a little more compatible with the software I use (or I’m not interested in troubleshooting).,Neutral
Intel,"linux is essentially useless for gaming and unless you are cs major you will have horrible time, 95% of stuff is completely undocumented and there are no guides for anything",Negative
Intel,"Maybe I’ll do more research on how to minimize Windows 11. After a factory reset.    I’m actually so spoiled by my current Apple M4 Pro Mac mini because it has factory reset options built in, and privacy stuff all over the place. It’s a great OS lol.   I’m dreading the return to Windows 11 because of bloat. I just want a clean new install of Windows, install of my motherboard drivers and GPU drivers, and then Steam + OBS.    Guess I will also need to research what YouTubers are using for their video editor nowadays too. Everything else is in browser (Instagram, Reddit, YouTube, Twitter etc.). Just want a super lean super fast PC for gaming and social media.",Positive
Intel,Why are you comfortable with giving kernel access to games like this?,Negative
Intel,Thank you. That addresses all I needed to know.  Anti cheat is the bane.   If I want to play B6 and Arc Raiders then this is a 100% nonstarter.   How tf is Steam Machine going to succeed if all the main multiplayer games are not compatible? Seems dead in the water.,Negative
Intel,"Nice. Thats awesome.   Question tho, can you use the GPU drivers? Can you stream with OBS on twitch and YouTube?",Positive
Intel,"Can confirm, AMD hardware is great. I have a half TB SSD with a Windows install I boot into when needed.",Positive
Intel,Ya AMD is much better supported but heard bazzite does a better job with Nvidia than most,Positive
Intel,"What about an older version?  Or can I simply go to Nvidia’s website and download the 3080 Ti drivers and let it do the full nvidia experience and I will get the best experience that it recommends for me?  Maybe going in blind is better, as Nvidia would be directing me to what they think is best",Neutral
Intel,No anticheat means their SteamOS and Steam machine is dead in the water anyway. Just learned this from the replies.   Thanks. I’ll stick with Windows 11,Negative
Intel,"I’m curious to try Bazzite but did the windows 11 factory reset last night.   If I do Bazzite, there’s no guarantee that I can livestream on OBS to Twitch or YouTube. And game availability might be limited. certainly the anticheat games will be.   So I could take a chance and experiment for a week, or just stick to windows. I have an RTX 3080 Ti right now so I’ve heard it’s not as good an experience as with AMD. But I’d benefit from at least getting to experience it",Neutral
Intel,Steam Machine is fucking dead in the water then. I heard Bazzite and SteamOS don’t support anticheat  I’ll factory reset Windows 11 tomorrow (somehow),Negative
Intel,"You'll definitely need to do your own research, but at one point you'll need to install one distro and play with it: see what works for you and what doesn't and if you can find workarounds or alternatives.   I've tried Bazzite and was happy with it. Most likely I'll like CatchyOS and Mint.   For me, the only thing Microsoft I use now is the OS, for everything else I've transitioned to something else: Brave for browser, Proton Mail and Drive, Standard Notes.",Neutral
Intel,"Because I like to play BF6, or the campaign in COD Modern Warfare 2022, last AAA I got during a sale.",Positive
Intel,"Because you either accept that no matter how much you hate kernel access, you only got two choices you either accept it in order to enjoy playing your favorite games or you choose not to allow it preventing you from playing the games you love",Negative
Intel,"Some games with anti-cheat work, some don't. As Linux gaming becomes more popular, game devs will adapt.",Neutral
Intel,Arc Raiders works fine,Neutral
Intel,"Yes, I have had both nvidia and amd graphics cards running on Linux, streaming to both platforms. Also yes I can run the latest drivers if they are available",Positive
Intel,Just dont use dlss 4.5 and you're good.,Neutral
Intel,Say that to the steam deck and most handhelds that support/run steamOS 😂,Neutral
Intel,I wouldn't say dead in the water. Linux is becoming more popular and all it takes is the game developers seeing there's enough market to get them to support anti cheat on Linux.  I think it's a current problem but I'm sure it'll become a non issue in time.,Positive
Intel,I would definitely look into and give it a shot. I had some weird issues using Steam OS where the WiFi would turn off when I started downloading things but that was the biggest problem I had.,Negative
Intel,Easiest way is to have another windows computer and use the microsoft windows 11 creation tool.,Positive
Intel,I get that you enjoy those games but why do you feel comfortable handing out kernel access to your OS?   Do you feel this is a good habit to get into where you hand over this type of access to any program?,Neutral
Intel,I am just very lucky because I don't like any of these aaa games that are pushing this anti cheat. So at this point its been very easy. Cod and BF are trash now IMHO. If something comes along that actually is something I want to play it will be harder but I will still just pass on it.   None of these games are worth keeping windows for. Not even close.,Negative
Intel,I’ll do more research then and not assume. Thanks.,Neutral
Intel,"Interesting, thank you. Probably a simple Google Reddit search about my 3080 Ti + (OS) + (OBS Twitch/youtube streaming) should do the trick.   Someone said some games with anticheat work on Linux also. Guess it depends on the devs.",Positive
Intel,"I meant purely as a desktop box for people looking to play competitive games at their desk with their existing mechanical keyboard and gaming mice, and for the guys that typically only buy call of duty and want to play on their couch in the living room.   For that use case, the Steam machine becomes immediately less desirable unless they can workout something related to anticheat with the specific devs.   For Steam deck **this does not apply at all, nor does my comment**.",Neutral
Intel,"if you have flash drive with usb-c, you can just download windows iso on your phone and extract it to that flash drive, you don't even need creation tool or rufus... I mean it's good to have, it lets you adjust the installation process, but it isn't necessary",Neutral
Intel,I am not the guy but i am speaking for millions of people i think:  - They don‘t care  - They want to play the game,Neutral
Intel,"I simply don't care. My life doesn't revolve around this (Windows vs Linux). These things are so unimportant to me that I don't think about them.   I think if you've asked me when I was in my 20s, I think I would have given you a different answer.   I just moved on.",Negative
Intel,"The biggest anticheat in the world does not have kernel security concerns. Relax buddy. Unless you’re doing some heinous illegal shit on your own computer, most normal people here aren’t paranoid about this stuff.",Negative
Intel,So I suppose it is just ignorance on what it means when you grant kernel access to a game?    Or do you think they still wouldn't care if they knew?   I personally won't buy any game requiring this. That's just a hard nope.,Negative
Intel,No this isn't a Linux vs Windows thing. Stay on whatever OS you want.   I'm just wondering why you are ok giving kernel access to a game? Are you just saying that system security is unimportant for you? Or maybe you run a separate OS install just for games?,Negative
Intel,"You don't need to do illegal things to be smart about security, what a strange thing to say.",Negative
Intel,"I think tons of people know and just don‘t care. If you care and lock yourself out of potentially very fun games, good for you",Negative
Intel,"System security is important up to a point until it gets in a way of actually enjoying life. I believe there should be a balance between security/privacy and usability.   I know Linux people think they have the most secure and most private systems out there, but I seriously doubt it: not talking about the MS telemetry, but what traffic goes out of the system, through your ISP, then what's seen my your own country security and surveillance systems.   I know what I'm going to do: I'll browse with incognito mode :))   I run one OS for everything, one 2TB SSD. I was thinking of going the dual boot route, but I've discovered I need to enable and re-enable Secure Boot anyway so I abandoned that idea.   I'll switch full time to a Linux when I'll be able to run whatever HW I want (no way I'm going back to AMD) and the games I play, run on that OS. For the same reason I'm not considering a Mac. Or I could switch full time on Linux, get nvidia gfn ultimate and play my games that way. But what's the point? I have a 12700KF, 32GB, 3070Ti and soon a 5070. Of course I'm going to play my games locally.   What's the point of locking myself into something that I don't want to use. I know it's popular to switch to Linux these days but let's be real here: it's not always feasible. I know, I know: Cyberpunk and Baldur's Gate 3 run on Linux, that's all I hear from ytbers but other games exists.   I'll agree with you about the AAA vs indies: it's a complete mess. In the last 5 years I can count the AAA games I bought on the fingers from one hand vs indies which I buy monthly.",Neutral
Intel,That's the case for me too: I know very well and moved on.,Neutral
Intel,"So far none of these games have felt like any sort of a sacrifice to not play. I did get interested in BF6 so I tried it but got bored right away. The indie developers are on fire lately, AAA has gotten really bad.",Negative
Intel,"I switched to amd this time but I was having good luck with nvidia on Linux mint.   I don't understand pigeon holeing into one brand or the other, it's not a marriage.",Positive
Intel,"Because I don’t want to waste more money. If I switch to AMD and I have problems again, like many 9800X3D users and like myself since 2019 till today, nobody will answer: no techtuber, no redditor, nobody else. It’s money down the drain. For what? To be AMD beta tester again on my time and with my money? No, thank you.",Negative
Intel,"The 12700k is slightly better than a 5800x3d.  If you think its worth it based on that info, sure.  I went from a 12700k to a 14700k, to a 9800x3d.    I play at 1440p, so it wasn't worth it going from the 14700k to the 9800x3d.",Positive
Intel,"Considering the current ram cost, no.  in general? It ultimately depends on your monitor refresh rate and resoultion.  If you have a monitor that is faster than 165hz at 1080, then the 9800x3d is worth it.  If you game only at 120hz and below at 1080, or 1440p to 4k, then you aren't really getting anything and you are going to pay a heavy premium for it.  As you are on z690/Z790, it might just make more sense to wait for the Bartlett-lake cpu with 12p cores and no E-cores that is supposedly releasing this year. Then you can  do an drop in upgrade that will be cheaper than a 9800x3d and you wont have to buy a new motherboard and overpriced ram.  As for stability, are you on Windows 11? Have you tried disabling your e-cores? What's your cooling/thermals like? In my experience the 12700K is one of intels best chips in the last 5 years so maybe its something else causing you instability?",Neutral
Intel,"If you're gonna be playing on it as well, I would opt for an 18"". As for resolution, 1080p is perfectly serviceable on smaller monitors and looks completely fine. 1080p only *really* wanes with larger displays.",Positive
Intel,"Thank you. Yeah I was thinking of just going 1080p. I’ve read other users saying that once they went 2k, they wouldn’t go back to 1080 but I believe that was more on daily tasks and not online gaming. Or maybe just get both on Amazon and return whichever one I don’t use? lol",Neutral
Intel,"On anything sub 24"" the difference between 1080p and 1440p is waaaay more negligible, the ppi on a 1080p 18"" display is 120 and the ppi for 1440p on a 27"" is 108, so the pixel density is actually higher on a 1080 18"" display",Neutral
Intel,Thank you for taking the time to explain that to me. 1080 it is then,Positive
Intel,"Id get a 5800x, i heard its good",Positive
Intel,"My $0.02: get a 5000-aeries chip, upgrade your bios and pop it in. Get a gpu and hope ramageddon ends when you're ready to go ddr5.  It might be worth paying the scalper for an X3d if you think that'll hold you that much longer. Even a 5700x3d is an amazing cpu, but then we're getting close to ddr5 money",Positive
Intel,5700x3D if you can find it around €250. 14600/14700k are best all around CPU with DDR4 support,Positive
Intel,"If a microcetner is close to you, you can get a 7800x3d, ram, and mobo for 580 which is unbeatable     If not, I just upgraded from a 3700x to a 5800xt, CPU heavy games still crank away at utilization (like battlefield 6) but in battlefield 6, I saw a 20-30fps increase, and generally a much smoother experience, and am running a 2070 super for reference.  The 5800x is a 'under' (barely) clocked 5800xt, but I only grabbed the xt because it was easy to find and on sale for 160 at the time.",Positive
Intel,I'll believe them (either Intel or AMD) when I see the benchmarks.  Until then this is all just pointless noise.,Neutral
Intel,well yeah you can't compare them because strix halo is on a signficantly larger die wheras panther lake is more comparable to something like the hx370.   If amd is able to get strix halo at a competitive price then sure it will compete but the issue is that with such a large die I don't think it is possible for them to compete in price with panther lake,Neutral
Intel,I’ll never understand why AMD is not committing to design RDNA4 based APUs and at this point I just take RDNA 3.5 as a joke because they can’t even support FSR4 on it officially nor the RX 7000 cards.  It’s like they are losing on purpose,Negative
Intel,"AMD has this “it’s good enough for a while and we’ll release something great that people will forget this happened”  Vega lasted in mobile for nearly 5 years and got RDNA2 designs. Now, it’s RDNA3.5 being built for mobile platform and betting on that to be good enough until RDNA5/UDNA bridge die designs releases (unverified rumor)  AMD also has this weird obsession with competitor naming. Sure, it’s meant to confuse buyers but it’s hurting them than helping, maybe it does help in terms of inventory.  They’re not intel-like of stagnation. They’re competing but not for us in the consumer market and we’re just getting scraps until enterprise trend die down (currently AI trend/bubble).  Well, it’s understandable as Zen designs are really focused in Epyc and scale down to Ryzen SKUs.  And the 400 series is a bad refresh when Ryzen 6000 mobile is the definitive refresh they have done, Zen 3+ and move to RDNA2. AMD could’ve done similar commitment but it’s not currently.  Also, AMD forgor Strix Halo laptops are still nowhere to be found aside from 1 or 2",Neutral

Intel,Idgaf when Strix Halo products are nowhere to be seen (notebooks),Negative
Intel,"Except that the B390 will be far more common as it will be seen in far more laptops. Yes, the 8060S & 8050s can be found in some laptops, but for the laptops you'll find in places like Currys, Best Buy or Mediamarkt, the B390 will be the most powerful iGPU you'll likely find & it'll happily outdo a Radeon 890M",Positive

Intel,Lot of markets and Intel did bribe the oems for decades and still do,Negative
Intel,The Intel igpu has a better upscaler by far. FSR3.1 is a third class competitor in comparison. People have been crying out for AMD to release FSR4 for RDNA3.5 but AMD has some seriously stupid execs in charge.,Negative

Intel,Don't they already have an integrated GPU that's on par with an RTX 4060? According to Framework?,Neutral
Intel,"strix halo is nice and all, but too prohibitively expensive to be considered for many people  arc b390/b370 will be available in much cheaper products for which amd doesn't have a proper answer to atm. amd's next lineup can't be lazy if they want to stay competitive",Negative
Intel,"The GPU doesn't matter if you don't have proper drivers and they are so far behind still Intel.   Great progress, but the drivers are still going to be the thing that makes people say no.   If intel keeps on chugging away and they work with all the DirectX games backwards and going forward.   I'm talking past DirectX games, you can't just worry about the new games there's games that are older that don't run well.   It took AMD many many years to get decent drivers, Intel I don't know if they're just focusing on hardware and not the drivers, but that so far is what's been holding it back.   Hopefully they can release a true dedicated GPU back in rival something that's out there at a much better price that will bring at least some competition back until the AI scam is over.",Negative
Intel,Panther Lake is using a superior process technology. So they are right. But it doesn't matter as customer will choose what's better. But until AMD has something out that uses 2nm then yes they will be behind probably,Neutral
Intel,I hope Intel stays competitive and AMD also brings its best to the table.,Positive
Intel,They should be worried about DLSS 4.5 though. Fix stuttering on FSR 4 and improve image quality,Neutral
Intel,I just wish Intel would make a very cut down panther lake offering to be the successor to the N1xx/N3xx line of efficient chips that have found their way into mini PCs.,Neutral
Intel,amd unfazed? I bet they are talking big shit again then will get absolutely demolished (as it happened with vega too),Negative
Intel,"Yeah it's old architechture, that's the point, Intel moved to the lastest node and barely manages to eek out a win. A win is a win nonetheless, but AMD still have plenty to dials to turn up.",Neutral
Intel,"I don't understand the fuss about iGPUs? Like why do they assume the average Joe would care about an IGPU at all? That's maybe 5% of the market and even then...most of them would get a dGPU anyways.  And apart from the GPU, what's special about the CPU? Combining (Lunar Lake) efficiency with (Arrow Lake) power? Sorry but my Ryzen AI 7 350 does that already. The top of the line x9 388h is about ~10% faster in single core aka the only thing that matters and will probably be in 2500€+ laptops whereas my 7 350 is in 500€ laptops.  I tried a 285h laptop besides the AI 7 350 and not only did it run hotter and less efficient, it also felt less snappier.    And the AI 7 350 was designed as a Lunar Lake competitor anyways so it was never worse in efficiency and ahead of Arrow Lakes like the 255h in that regard.  So I don't see why anything should really change...?",Negative
Intel,"AMD doesn't want to bring RDNA 4 to APUs, so as not to give FSR4 to users other than those with dedicated GPUs.",Neutral
Intel,a brand new product on a newer node is better than an older product on an older node?! who knew?,Positive
Intel,"And the price. I used to be an AMD fan, but as soon as competition with Intel was gone, AMD raised their prices and now act as if they believe they are a luxury brand. Hope Intel gets back into the game and if Intel can slash their prices it might end-up being the right choice.  At the same price, Intel is dead on arrival. At a serious discount they will take the place of AMD. No one is buying Strix Halo for handhelds, it is too expensive.",Neutral
Intel,Plenty of folks tested it at CES.  Intel was confident enough to let reporters run benchmarks and it's basically around 4050 level.  You should be able to run most games at 1080p at medium-high settings in an Ultrabook form factor.,Neutral
Intel,"Both are right/wrong.  Intel made their comparisons to Strix point because they’re in the same power class. Panther lake is much faster than Strix Point at the same power level (according to Intel, AMD doesn’t deny that) at 45W.  AMD says it doesn’t matter because their Strix halo (up to 120W) is faster which is pretty obvious.   It’s not technically lying, AMD is just referencing an entirely different class of product.",Neutral
Intel,"Well lunar lake is a monster and competes directly with the z2e both on performance and efficiency, so no reason to think panther lake will be worse.  Even if it falls short of Intels claims it will still be the leader until next year.",Neutral
Intel,The noise is doing a great job advertising for them. A war between them with fighting words will get them tons of free advertising.,Positive
Intel,And a much higher power budget.  AMD says they win because their 120W chip is faster than Intels 45W chip.   No surprise to anyone.,Positive
Intel,"I generally agree but i suspect that the 388h is using a much larger gpu than people suspect. I think its probably ~165mm2 in size, not 55mm2. i suspect the 55mm2 die varient is for the 4xe version, and the 12xe version is 3x that size.  I also dont understand why strix halo is so expensive. It would be interesting to see bom and packaging costs.",Neutral
Intel,"It sounds like RDNA4 just doesn't scale at all. All the rumors point to them going straight from RDNA3.5 to RDNA5 in APUs, just skipping RDNA4 all together.",Negative
Intel,RDNA 3.5 was the only reason I didn’t invest in a STRIX HALO mini PC. The price is too much for outdated unsupported tech.,Negative
Intel,"Might be the same reason they stuck with Vega for so long in APUs.  At the current available desktop memory (DDR4 at the time) an architecture change wouldn't have made a huge difference.    Once DDR5 came out for laptops, we finally saw RDNA 2+ APUs (Ryzen 6000 APUs).  I'd bet once DDR6 starts appearing on laptops we'll get a similar iGPU architecture leap.",Neutral
Intel,"AMD probably just didn't bother making a new APU design when they didn't have new CPU core to go with it. Medusa Halo is rumored for 2027 with Zen 6 and UDNA/RDNA5, so the Point version will likely release then too.",Neutral
Intel,AMD has and always will be their own worst enemy,Negative
Intel,"It's not like they aren't developing something this whole time, releases are planned many years in advanced. Intel will have some rope and then will get inevitably leap frogged",Neutral
Intel,It's not like Intel isn't doing the same. Panther Lake and ARC are holdovers of things developed under Gelsinger.,Neutral
Intel,"> AMD is going to f--- around and let Intel catch up, in CPUs and GPUs.  this is what we actually need: competition. AMD kicked intels butt, now intel is kicking back. it's a win for us either way.",Neutral
Intel,I hope Intel will catch up and encourage AMD to compete. Having cleat leader in CPUs or GPUs is bad for consumers.,Negative
Intel,"I mean, we know that AMD is innovating. They literally showed Zen 6 at CES. Its just not ready yet for mobile, and Intel caught up. Same thing happened with Alder Lake, where intel released that before Zen 4 was ready.",Neutral
Intel,"So AMD having much faster iGPUs for decade or more did not do much.  But now Intel rolling out something at unknown price/power package will absolutely decimate AMD.  Regardless of what will happen, ""AMD's fault"" indeed. (amazing silicon designers and experts at everything posting for free on reddit have convinced me)",Negative
Intel,"Laptops haven't really been AMD's focus, and apart from Zen1, AMD's focus has been mostly on data center, with desktop being the natural offshoot.",Neutral
Intel,Yeah they ain't immune to being complacent.  And bad press doesn't make Intel stay bad.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, their leaders aside from Ms. Su are all holdovers from AMD almost bankrupt times. Software sucks, graphics sucks, and now they are taking CPU down the drain too with high prices. Shitty leaders, lead to shitty outcomes.   They post high useless benchmark numbers no one cares about. They cannot compete with Apple in terms of battery life, and get creamed at low power levels.",Negative
Intel,"News at 10: ""Companies prioritise profits""",Neutral
Intel,"so either AMD doesn't have the capacity to produce them, or OEMs aren't interested, neither option is a compelling reason for AMD to focus on mobile",Negative

Intel,"Yes, Strix Halo",Neutral
Intel,And having fsr4 supported in mobile at all,Neutral
Intel,FSR 4+ may be great but game support (number of titles + GPUs supported) is embarrassingly low,Negative
Intel,Dlss 4.5 not that great in my opinion. It fixes some ghosting but creates more shimmering because it has so much sharpening. I had to dial back to 4.0.,Negative
Intel,wildcat lake.  only issue it seems to be using 2 P cores and 4 LPE cores instead of E + LPE,Neutral
Intel,70% faster being “barely eke out a win”? Go ask why amd is stuck with 18 month old architecture despite intel managing to replace arrow lake after 12?,Negative
Intel,"You’ve got it backwards. The majority of laptops use IGPUs. IGPUs being as powerful as integrated graphics allows for cheaper thinner devices that are more power efficient. The entire intel CPU/IGPU performs on par with a 4050 at 60w at only 45w. When you factor in the 10-15w the CPU takes with the 4050 and you’re looking at similar performance at like half the power.   Being power efficient opens up a lot of form factors to be able to game with such as thin and light laptops, tablets, or gaming handhelds",Neutral
Intel,"> I used to be an AMD fan, but as soon as competition with Intel was gone, AMD raised their prices and now act as if they believe they are a luxury brand.   That's why it's silly to be a ""fan"" or ""supporter"" of one company or the other.

At a serious discount they will take the place of AMD. No one is buying Strix Halo for handhelds, it is too expensive.  Outside of that one device (Ayaneo maybe?), you're right.  But now AMD is also releasing an 8-core version of Strix Halo with the full 40 GPU CUs, which should be cheaper.  I expect that we'll see that in more handhelds at the high end.  Realistically speaking, it's easy to make the case that on a 7""-9"" screen the 40 CUs is way overkill.  There's still room for a middle ground that Intel could easily fill.",Negative
Intel,"Absolutely consumers win when competition is hot, AMD has a bit too much of a lead ATM so they are cashing in and getting lazy. That said I am glad they are having their day, only because a few years ago they were on the brink of bankruptcy and I really want to see them on a fairly level playing field with Intel... If we end up with 2 juggernauts training blows, having big resesrch budgets, etc we'll get lots of innovation and competitive pricing.",Neutral

Intel,Wasn't it equivalent more or less to the 4050m as it was power limited to 30 watts?,Neutral
Intel,"It's the price of the final product that will matter.  And given that Intel has lion's share of the mobile market, I don't see why the would not ask outrageous $$$ for it.  It is ""impressive"" only in the ""for iGPU"" context.   Based on the benches shown, laptops were consuming around 60W.  While AMD""s 370 HX has been shown to be able to game at below 20W, so uh.  Let's bait for wenchmarks in any case.",Neutral
Intel,"Sure, sure.  I'm going to wait for proper benchmarks done under lab conditions and documented by more than ""Intel let me run this game with the FPS counter on.""

Intel,This. Plus even lunar lake outperformed Strix Point in many scenarios already. Intel is at least one generation ahead here,Positive
Intel,"It's not the 4050 at 60W. The laptop they compared only allows for 30W to the 4050. Nvidia's specs for the 4050 is 35W minimum, so I don't know how Dell even got to 30W. Below a certain wattage, gpu performance decreases exponentially because a minimum level of power is required to even have the gpu turned on.   Panther Lake is built on Intel 18A, which is supposed to be much better than the 'ancient' TSMC 5nm the 4050 is built on. The 4050's cpu is also Arrow Lake, which is less efficient than Lunar Lake. Again, that skews the agenda.   You can already game on thin and light devices with discrete graphics. Laptops like Asus's G14 is only 3.3lb, but sports a 4060 which is like twice as fast as intel's new igpu. The dgpu turns itself off when on battery, and the integrated graphics takes over. Anything more intensive should be used with a charger plugged in.   In short, paying for a big igpu doesn't make much sense for anyone interested in performance. And gaming handhelds? Does anyone really care about those useless bricks for investment into integrated graphics? It's not like the cost of Panther Lake is going to be cheap when its laptops start at $1300. With that kind of money, you can get 2025 Asus Zephyrus G14 with a 5060 and blow its shit out the water. Or for those on a budget, 5050 laptops have been seen for $600.   Integrated graphics have come so far, pairing Intel's newest 18A Panther Lake with an RTX 4050 could still make a lot of sense.",Negative
Intel,"Ehh not the mayority but *all* computers use iGPUs. The thing is, for the average Joe aka 95% of the market, there won't be a difference in the usage between an Intel Iris or RTX 5090 dGPU. And the efficiency would only come into place if they would game on battery (who does that anyways) or create/edit videos (again, virtually no one would do that without a dGPU). And even then, having your laptop drained in 2 hours 15 minutes instead of 2 hours is not ""gamechanging""   So it does not affect the efficiency at all during webbrowsing, watching videos, creating documents etc.  Thats also the reason why Intel has the non X 5,7,9 which will properly be by far the more demanded version as, again, the average Joe does not care the slightest about iGPU.  And apart from the iGPU, PTL is just a tiny step up from the Ultra 200 series...",Neutral

Intel,"No, not really. Making up a ""winner"" is stupid and nothing but fanboy behavior.  A faster dGPU is generally better because you’re generally not power limited on a desktop. It doesn’t really matter whether or not you have a 5060 or 5090 or whatever.  In mobile systems it’s a huge difference.  There are entirely different power classes that don’t compete with each other. A thin and light notebook with a 15W CPU cannot have a 100W CPU in it.  Panther lake aims towards unplugged performance which is the 45W power class and the same as Strix Point.  Strix Halo is a much higher power class that requires a laptop to be plugged in permanently for the full performance.  It’s for mobile desktops that are usually plugged in but can be mobile for some time with heavily degraded performance.  It’s an entirely different class of product and you won’t find (many) devices where Strix Halo and Strix Point/Panther Lake compete with each other.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, i am gonna contend that either that is wrong, and is the 4xe version, or that intel basically lied on their benchmarks.  If none of those two things are true, Intel's new graphics architecture will absolutely dominate in the next round of discrete graphics GPUs.  with B580 intel needed \~80% more silicon to match nvidia performance. Now they need \~10-20% less die area. meaning their performance per transistor basically doubled gen/gen. which is unheard of. Even maxwell (largest architectural uplift in the history of GPUs in the last 10 years) did not achieve anything close to that. And it was a massive overhaul with huge changes.

AMD cant do with RDNA 3.5. id expect 8060s to be a much more powerful igpu but it is lacking what is essentially lossy compression for realtime graphics. that is a pretty big deal and i do think it will be what causes Strix halo to be a product that just ages poorly, costs too much for what it is really (308mm^2 io/igpu chiplet cant be cheap on 4nm) its really amds pipe cleaner for future packing tech.  people said they same when the zen chiplets were rumored to be the size they are. you save a lot of area not needing memory controller on that chip would be my guess. d2d bonding is very space efficient compared  for some perspective strix halo igpu block + media engine block is about 120mm^2 on N4P(143.7216MTr/mm^2) of the iod, the rest is i/o and the npu.  the 12 Xe3 chip is 55mm^2 on N3E(216MTr/mm^2) (so we could napkin approximate about 80mm^2 if it was on N4P)",Neutral

They use the 64b channel convention as it is a customer facing spec, that doesn't meant they actually have that many channels in hardware.   The Pantherlake datasheet isn't public yet, but you can see plainly in the [actual spec sheet](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/memory-controller-mc/) for Arrowlake H that it supports 8 channels of LPDDR5X (additional [spec](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/supported-memory-modules-and-devices/) for channel width).

You cannot gang these channels into a dual channel mode, that is not how modern memory works, and there is no allowance in the LPDDR5 spec for 64b channels. The 16b channels have separate command/address buses and burst for a sufficient length (32n) to fill a cache line with each access.  To be clear I think standardising on 64b ""channels"" for marketing specifications is a good thing, it allows quick mental calculation of memory bandwidth without having to get into the nitty gritty.

I recently got a 9070xt and have been overall very impressed, but its achilles heel seems to be ray tracing. This isn't exactly surprising to me, as I researched my GPU options to death before buying one, and the general consensus is that Nvidia is stronger in the ray tracing department. But if I were to boot up, say, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, a game that supports ray tracing at 60 fps on the base Play Station 5, could I expect it to perform better than a similarly demanding game that wasn't particularly optimized for AMD hardware?  It's largely hypothetical question, as I already own the GPU, am satisfied with the GPU, and of course did my due diligence before buying the GPU so I would know exactly what to expect.

Now my RX 9070 XT is not detected at all in BIOS or Windows Device Manager, and I only get display output from the motherboard.  WHAT HAPPENED To see the old SATA SSD in the boot menu I had to enable CSM in the BIOS. Booting into that drive resulted in a black screen. I then used a Live USB to run the boot-repair utility with the recommended repair settings. This seems to have installed the GRUB partition onto my Crucial T500 M.2 drive instead of the SATA drive. Now I can boot into both OSs, but the GPU is completely invisible to the system.  CURRENT STATUS Windows Device Manager only shows the Integrated Graphics. When I try to install AMD drivers, the installer fails because it cannot detect the GPU. I was briefly able to get graphics output from my GPU by unplugging the PC, flipping the PSU switch to off, and holding the power button to empty the capacitors. I then booted it up with the HDMI cable plugged into my GPU and I saw the asrock logo but it was stuck there for 2 minutes and I impatiently turned it off. I'm also considering trying this again and letting it run it's course  PLAN AND QUESTIONS I am planning to disconnect the SATA SSD and try to wipe the Ubuntu boot entries from the M.2 drive to see if the GPU reappears. Has anyone experienced a Linux bootloader repair or CSM toggle hiding a GPU from the BIOS? Specifically, could the Crucial T500 and ADATA drive conflict be causing PCIe initialization issues after the CSM change? Should I try clearing the CMOS first? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

If you're seeing temperatures over 100°C, that's likely a cooling problem that could damage your chip over time. I'd probably check my cooling system and setup if I were you. That said, another 7800X3D user might think differently, so maybe there is nothing to worry about.

Intel,25.9.1 works on my 9070 XT. Everything after that is a mess for me,Negative
Intel,Tagging u/AMD_Vik  so they are aware of the issues.       I encountered the same problems on my 6800xt. Figma on chrome is causing random BOSD. The system will just restart without notice. Every single web app seems unstable on my system and memory usage is all over the place. Rolling back to 25.9.1 doesn't fix everything but it eliminates 70% of the issues..,Negative
Intel,Oh well. :/  Funny thing is I rebooted my PC again for a Windows update. The first thing that greeted me after opening a web browser was the driver giving up the ghost.  On 25.11.1.,Neutral
Intel,Ive been wondering what this seemingly random crashing has been. Thanks for this comment!,Neutral
Intel,"9800x3d, 6950xt, no issue with either chrome or discord or firefox with hardware accelerated set",Neutral
Intel,"Me too.  Installed 25.12.1, whenever I use YouTube in Full Screen, the whole system freezes, while the sound is still audible, then I have to hard-restart my PC. Happened three times, decided to downgrade to 25.11.1 again.",Negative

Intel,"I'm piggybacking, because I need that info too",Neutral
Intel,"I can't seem to keep framerates under control in a lot of games, generally smaller simpler games, with the new 9070xt. Enhanced sync, vsync, chill, boost, whatever I do I'm still wondering why my pc is at 100% gpu, 600fps, and 300w power draw playing something like minecraft or geometry dash.  Even with a 144hz display. I'd be happy locked at 60 even.",Negative
Intel,Ok I thought I was the only one having the enhanced sync issue because no one replied to any of my posts about it. I use it because then I can lock my fps to 120 (on a 4K OLED TV) and use enhanced sync instead of Vsync because of the screen tearing when locking to 120. Now I have to do the frame lock to 117 which is fine but just annoying me I'm missing out on 3 fps lol it was causing issues in a few games where it would stutter like crazy and it all came down to enhanced sync. I don't use noise suppression so I don't know what's up with that.,Negative
Intel,"Been using it for a few hours with the 7900XTX, so far so good.   Hopefully it's 100% fixed.",Positive
Intel,I hope they fixed it. I will test it now,Positive
Intel,"Did the typical test that I usually do and it didn't show up for me and I'm on the RX 7700XT as well. So hopefully, it's fixed.",Neutral
Intel,"AMD stopped giving a shit about it's fans once the company was saved and they started raking in the money. The change in tone was clear as day. That said, I'll still buy their GPUs because I hate Nvidia far more and I don't see that changing.",Negative
Intel,"yeah my next one will be Nvidia, better features, better performance espacialy with RT/PT   And apperently longer support... and AMD cards in a simmilar performacne bracket don't even cost THAT much less sooo.... jeah I am mad aswell",Negative
Intel,"I agree. AMD has shown poor support for 7000 series owners. If there was a FSR4 int8 leak, AMD should officially release FSR4 for 7000 series owners.  I bought my 7800xt only 2 years ago before RDNA4 cards came out.  Nvidia provides DLSS4 upscaling to their older generations like rtx3000 series",Negative

Intel,"I came over from NVDA last March, bought a 7900xtx, RMAd it a few weeks ago due to pink/purple pixelation that would randomly happen. Now it's non stop driver timeouts and random performance issues every time I boot my PC or games. I am never buying another AMD card. I'd rather get ripped off by NVDA and not have constant headaches.",Negative
Intel,"Which driver are you currently on? I'm just curious; personally, I'm on 25.9.2, and surprisingly, I have 0 problems, unlike with previous versions. Should I try 25.12.1?",Positive
Intel,"Nope. Generally if the driver does not massively increases performance in some game, or you don't have any issues or the issue you have isn't fixed, then it's not worth updating, unless there is some new feature you want.    I reverted back to 25.9.1 (from the top of my head) because with any newer driver BF6 crashes randomly, and neither DICE nor AMD seem to give a damn about it.    And before someone asks, I tried any other fix on the internet for Battlefield and nothing else worked.",Negative
Intel,Same here. Anything above 25.9.2 crashes ray tracing games like Silent Hill  2 and Oblivion Remastered.   Ihr never had a more crash prone GPU than the 9070XT.,Negative

Intel,5070ti fs  basically a better 9070xt,Positive
Intel,"I’d wait on 5080ti with more VRAM but these are going to be obscenely expensive knowing nvidia + current RAM prices. Both 5070ti or 5080 are more of a sidegrade than upgrade, not worth the hassle IMO.",Negative
Intel,Get a 5070ti. I never thought I would say that. But this is what is is.. 9 months after release and the drivers are still D.S.,Negative
Intel,What about a secondhand 5070ti?,Neutral
Intel,"I mean, I wouldn't get either. 5070 TI is a sidegrade from the XTX, and 5080 is only slightly better. DLSS and RT would be the only reason.",Neutral
Intel,Sidegrading for an upscaler sounds like a joke.,Negative
Intel,"I think Linux developers are doing some experiments As of now, FSR 4 (FidelityFX Super Resolution 4) does not officially support RDNA 2 or RDNA 3 GPUs, even on Linux. However, thanks to Develer’s work on VKD3D-Proton 3.0, there is partial and unofficial support for RDNA 3 under specific conditions.  RDNA 3: Partial Support via Develer’s VKD3D-Proton  - Develer’s VKD3D-Proton 3.0 includes support for FP8 (8-bit floating point), which is required for FSR 4. - This means RDNA 3 GPUs (like RX 7600, 7900 XT/XTX) can run FSR 4 in some games via Proton, even though AMD doesn’t officially enable it. - Global override toggles in AMD’s 25.9.1 driver can bypass the FSR 4 whitelist, allowing it to run in FSR 3.1-compatible games.  I hope they succed it will be a slap in the face.",Neutral
Intel,This has been announced for months.,Neutral
Intel,Yeah AMD refusing to port features to any card released before the 9 series makes supporting them really hard.,Negative
Intel,Say thanks they haven't demoted 7000 series to only game drivers,Neutral
Intel,"Your best case is your RX 7900 turning into Balsamico, whatever that means.",Positive
Intel,"Its because RDNA 4 added hardware that 3 and 2 don't have. Now before I get kicked to death by angry people, there is a version of FSR Redstone that uses and INT8 path that is compatible and will work on 2 and 3, however that has not been launched today and AMD have not confirmed it will be.   That isn't to say they won't do it, but right now it's not been announced. Perhaps there will be enough noise to get AMD to change their mind or it might be that they want to get it out on their latest cards first before complicating matters with older RDNA support.  Only time will tell",Neutral
Intel,"Bro the AI accelerators completely got revamped, upscaling technique isn't usually the indicator for 'fine wine', it is when non-upscaling raw performance numbers improve.",Positive

Intel,Finally fixed! It's a christmas miracle!!!,Positive
Intel,I regret getting this 7800xt,Negative

Intel,sadly,Negative
Intel,"Yep, I go back between 23.9.1 and 25.9.2. I couldn't be happier.",Positive
Intel,"If it's any consolation, I was on an NVidia card for 2+ years where I wasn't getting the DLSS updates. Then they actively removed features when they went to the NVIDIA app.  Looking at AMD's roadmap, RDNA4 looks like a stopgap anyway until RDNA5 (prob will be called UDNA?) comes out. So in another year and a half I'll be in the same situation with my 9060XT.",Negative
Intel,"Use OBS, replay buffer",Neutral
Intel,Was just thinking of giving a shot for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - I guess not anymore since FSR4 doesn't work with it..,Neutral

Intel,"I just want to say I think I found the culprit. It also happens on the winupdate one too, because it started crashing all the time.  Core clock boosts itself WAY past what it is declared on the card(I got a Sapphire 9070XT Nitro, supposed to be 3060MHz). Here's the moment before it crashes to a black screen:  [afterburner screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/3YpJFtzM/Screenshot-2025-12-21-030537.png)  The dip in clocks is the moment it crashes. As you can see, it is running well above boost clocks. Hence, freezing in a few minutes, proceeded by a black screen, and a crash. The ups and downs are from me alt tabbing in the graphs, by  the way.   This is with core clock -200mhz applied in Afterburner and no crashes, boosts to just above declared boost clocks. Here the dips in up and down on power are probably me toying around how much exactly -mhz is needed.

Intel,"I have to do the same. My monitor is  240Hz and the TV  120Hz and I have to use Chill, which sometimes will cause stuttering, because enhanced sync always causes stuttering.

Intel,"performance wise it should only be a couple frames of latency, when doing rendering on dgpu and going out through igpu it'll just copy over the frame buffers.   Main impact is on pcie bandwidth as it'll use up quite a lot there, and to a smaller degree RAM load, so you definitely don't want to run some other dynamic load on the igpu when gaming to overwhelm its pcie link.

Since being on the 5700 XT, 6900 XT, 7900 XT and now 9070 XT, I was never able to use it globally but it's been quite a few drivers since I've checked if it worked.

Intel,So are the issues with Arc Raiders fixed? I had to roll back to 25.9.1 because 25.10.1 kept crashing my game. Did they actually fix it?,Negative
Intel,Disabling ULPS seem to fix the crash. My pc crash pretty often when i wake the screen or turn it on if i dont disable ulps with msi afterburner. 9070xt,Negative
Intel,Doom: The Dark Ages does not lauch with the latest driver. I had to rollback to 25.9.2 in order to play. Please fix,Negative
Intel,Last driver crashes Apex Legends every joined game. Im fuckin over amd.,Negative
Intel,Support for Anno 117: Pax Romana - Incorrect. I have needed to downgrade back to 25.9.2 to play Anno 117: Pax Romana without crashing. The last updates have been a joke. I now cannot use adrenaline due to needing to play on this earlier version to be able to play any new games. Does anyone know of where I can express my complaints?  Edit: This is also the same for Arc Raiders.,Negative
Intel,"Here we go again, jetzt stürzt Battlefield 6 wieder ab. Mit dem Treiber davor hatte ich es in den Griff bekommen außer XMP war aktiviert, dann stürzte es dennoch ab.    Also es scheint definitiv ein AMD Treiber Problem zu sein.    Gut das bei euch die Kunden die Tester sind und nicht ihr das übernehmen müsst.  PS: Gespielt wird mit einer 7900XT und einem 7800X3D.      Das war definitiv meine erste und letzte Karte von AMD. So viel Probleme hatte ich mit Team Grün nicht.",Neutral
Intel,Yeah same here LG c5 42inch 😰,Negative
Intel,"Having system crash issues after putting the PC into sleep mode. Samsung 57"" Odyssey Neo G9. Now I know who to blame.  Reinstalled AMD drivers and changed the settings so that my PC never gets into sleep mode (turns off the screen, but doesn’t sleep or hibernate). This fixed the issue temporarily for me :(  Also from the system crash minidump, it's very clearly an AMD driver issue  **IMAGE\_NAME:  amdkmdag.sys**",Negative
Intel,"I have this but on display port, HDMI works fine",Neutral

Intel,"I had to go back to version 25.9.2 but I no longer have AMD Adrenalin. If I try to install it, it reinstalls version 25.11, which crashes my game. Is it necessary to have AMD Adrenalin? I have a 7900 XTX and a Ryzen 9 7950X3D.",Negative
Intel,Could you try a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter? I wonder if it works in this situation =D,Neutral
Intel,I have the same issue with display port but it’s okay with hdmi :/,Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, I plan to make sure my next display has Display Port in it. Mostly for linux though.",Positive
Intel,"There will already be branching inside the code of the driver. This has been the case already, to various degrees, for years. It's not new.  It's just whether AMD wants to formally spread those branches out on a file / compilation level and distribute different packages. And then publicly whether they commit to updating all branches of code or only some.  For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch. Of course, we have very little outside insight into the exact spread of these cases that AMD wants to pay their engineers to work on.",Neutral
Intel,There is a separate code path for specific things bit both are in those combine driver. Its mostly about certain ray tracing extensions   There are also fp8 and fp16 codepaths    People misunderstand and thought its like pre rdna stuff.,Neutral
Intel,"V25.10.2  here… I have both CPU and GPU by AMD and if you download the specific package, they install drivers only for the specific hardware (and they have different dimensions). For installing both drivers you have to download the AutoDetect package.  EDIT: typo",Neutral
Intel,"I'm one of the 5 people still running a Vega 64 and for years we've had a separate driver ""branch"" despite being able to install new Adrenaline versions. Bf6 beta wouldn't run without spoofing my actual internally installed driver, which hadn't been updated since they dropped support.",Negative
Intel,combined again it looks like 🤷‍♂️,Neutral
Intel,the display team are working on this with priority. Hoping to have this out in the next release. There are two similar display issues on their radar which are both P1.,Neutral

Intel,You try install last chipset driver ?,Neutral
Intel,"Bummer you're having issues. Hopefully AMD gets it straightened out for you. Out of curiosity, why did you decide to use HDMI on your monitor instead of display port? I thought HDMI was mostly used for TVs nowadays.",Negative
Intel,So it's the driver that's why that happens 😡 and it's not fixed?,Negative
Intel,Thank you for your service,Positive
Intel,"I've had the ""device_hung"" error and the best drivers are those you are on.   AMD needs a lot of help with their drivers...",Negative
Intel,Any update mate?,Neutral
Intel,"No, radeon drivers update cannot upgrade your CPU so that it would stop bottlenecking your GPU.",Negative

Intel,I'm playing it on 7900 GRE with FSR4 INT8 with no issues.,Positive
Intel,na it works the problem only occures when using PathTracing and you are not going to play on an AMD card with PT anyways and especially not a 7700XT,Negative
Intel,"I played recently the latest patch of Cyberpunk 2077 with RX 7700 XT with drivers from February this year, 25.2.1 and had no issues, no stutter, no lag, no crashes, the problem is with path tracing or ray tracing something, you don't have to use that even and it lowers fps probably for very little visual gain.",Positive
Intel,If it still crashes set RTX Global Illumination to Static.,Negative
Intel,"pretty sure anti lag was causing my system to freeze up when in arc raiders on 25.10. turned it on and issues, turned it off and haven't had issues since",Negative
Intel,"Optimizing has nothing to do with fixing crashing, generally, that would be bug fixing.",Negative
Intel,"The only Redstone component that will work through the driver for upgrading existing features (like FSR3 FG) will be ML FG, but only for games that have FSR 3.1.4+(and FSR FG), as they’ve already announced in a GPUOpen article quite a while ago.   Ray Regeneration (RR) and Neural Radiance Cache (NRC) require dev implementation since they’re much deeper in engine code/inputs.",Neutral
Intel,"Does BO7 have ray tracing? Where is that feature mentioned, would be keen to read about it 🤓",Positive
Intel,"Itll probably work through optiscaler, but a game like indiana jones has locked dlss inputs, so you need dev implementation",Neutral
Intel,"And all my USB devices dropped for a while, far worse experience than the usual double screen flicker & it's done.  Edit: seems like that was because of iGPU driver for my Zen4. In the end and after 6+ reinstalls, I'm stopping on 25.9.1 and have Vulkan working again.",Negative
Intel,What is wrong with CP? Just got my 9070 after 10+ years of nvidia :o   Ah nvm i see it.,Negative
Intel,Ugh,Neutral
Intel,"Most likely when your distro provides a kernel update.  I'd give this a quick read: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-update-and-see-what-graphics-driver-you-have-on-linux-and-steamos/  Pretty much the default is that you will be using the Mesa driver collection and they were last updated yesterday.  The fixes there do not correlate with the ones in this thread (I think).  As long as you are on a ""cutting edge"" type distro then you can expect that update in the next few days/weeks.  If you are on a ""stable"" distro that doesn't update often, you may be waiting a realllly long time.",Neutral
Intel,"Get what exactly? Features? Bug fixes? Optimizations?   Every 2 weeks there are new Mesa driver updates with bug fixes and performance optimizations. As for features, you have to wait a few months for versions with big numbers (25.2 is soon updating to 25.3, adding Anti-lag 2).   Depending on your distribution, you can get these updates faster or slower.",Neutral
Intel,"Linux doesn’t work like windows. You get updates directly via Mesa stack. When your distro provides mesa package update, that’s when you get driver updates, and they’re completely different from windows branch.",Neutral
Intel,just uninstall it I prefer manual check myself.,Negative
Intel,So AMDs default driver overclocks and doesn’t reflect that in the values?,Neutral
Intel,Same issues here i underclocked it but this new update just made it worse,Negative
Intel,ok it is still crashing ... complete reboot :(,Negative
Intel,"I feel like that crash is more on DICE's side, since Nvidia users get the same exact crash, although less often.  I tried everything I saw on the internet, nothing really works. Sometimes I can play for hours on end, other time game just crashes randomly after 10-15 minutes.  I am going to try to downgrade to 25.9.1 and see how it fares, since I remember that driver being really stable for me (6800XT).  Edit: been playing for 4 hours, no crash yet. Never had such a long session without the game crashing.  Will update in the next few days.  Edit 2: haven't crashed once, been playing at least 2 hours every evening.",Negative
Intel,Okay.,Neutral
Intel,I’m hoping Valve’s new steam machine will push them on that since it’s RDNA3 based.,Neutral
Intel,The RT/PT reflections leading to CTDs issue? We're working with CDPR to resolve this - it's not caused by the driver software.,Neutral
Intel,"Stuff like this is honestly bugging me.  First AMD card and while it is okay to have some driver issues, stuff like that shouldn't be a thing at all. It can't be that some bugs keep existing for multiple months let alone more than half a year.",Negative
Intel,A much more fundamental thing like playing video in a window without stuttering took 3 or 4 driver updates.,Neutral
Intel,"> One year already...Cyberpunk 2077 not fixed yet.  On year, I did not know.  I was thinking of a 9070XT earlier in spring, but choose... differently",Negative
Intel,welcome to amd,Positive
Intel,Yeah hoping it works. I guess the point about crashing with easy anticheat was the fix? Doesn't specifically mention but it was with raytracing enabled I was getting the crash. I suppose we shall find out.,Neutral
Intel,"Weird. I was running 10.2 and things were running fine for the most part. I kept getting a pop-up on launch saying there was a known issue with that driver and Arc Raiders though, so I rolled it back to 9.2 and had more issues on that release than the one with the stated problems.  My fan control profile broke and stopped tracking gpu temp so last night I did a clean DDU install back to 10.2.  Of course 12 hrs later the new release drops haha  Hopefully Fan Control continues to play nice if I just update",Negative
Intel,Same. Never even had Ryzen master installed.,Negative
Intel,"I'm receiving the same error in Event Viewer, but I have installed Ryzen Master. Most likely it's also a component of the Adrenalin drivers for system tuning and monitoring.

Intel,I agree.  I also have this issue  Weird is if you turn on amd overlay it fixes itself,Neutral
Intel,"That it did, lol. My only complaint.",Negative
Intel,"Not a problem on Linux with Wayland. Ever.   Main reason I ditched Windows 11, constant screen tearing and input lag made me go crazy.",Negative
Intel,The new AFMF features were added in 25.10.2 - Still waiting for AFMF 3.0 at this stage,Neutral
Intel,Suggest if you are using powertoys to stop... After their last game update it was crashing left and right. Powertoys was cause. I only crashed once and I believe it was cfeen blanking was cause for that. I was away too long.,Negative
Intel,"Fps drop over time? That's a game issue, it's got a memory leak",Negative
Intel,"What kind of FPS drops? I was having dog shit frame pacing, and hardcore drops to like sub 60 FPS at 1440p medium/high with a 6950XT. I went through every setting and found that anti-lag was the culprit. Once I turned that off it all went away. Then with future frame rendering it got even smoother. Now I can hold 100+ FPS at all times, sometimes peaking over 200 FPS in some scenarios. And frame times are smooth as butter.",Negative
Intel,I’d settle for bf6 going one entire game without drivers crashing the game and freezing pc,Neutral

Intel,"Sad to say I am having the same issue. Did you find any workarounds, or just downgrade?",Negative
Intel,"You don't need to make it work on Adrenalin, Battlefield 6 already has FSR 4 support integrated into the game, so you don't need to override, just turn off FSR 4 from Adrenalin.",Neutral

Intel,Epic version runs just fine.,Positive
Intel,Cyberpunk GOG last version patch runs fine on this driver.,Positive
Intel,"Hey there, can you give an example of how this looks now versus how it's supposed to?",Neutral
Intel,are you able to install driver only with the newest drivers? When i choose minimal or driver only it still install full version of the software anyway. Only 25.9.1 works perfectly.,Neutral
Intel,Yeah... it can happen. I was already locked outside windows after a bsod with my old nvidia card. I had to use a linux usb drive to fix it through the command line.,Negative
Intel,It's most likely the same as I've described here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1ow4in7/comment/nop2o04/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1ow4in7/comment/nop2o04/)  But yeah unfortunately seems like all you can do for now is either roll back to 25.10.2 or disable your iGPU if you don't use it,Negative
Intel,probably because those issues are build specific.  I've not had any freezing or locks on any drivers this whole year.,Neutral
Intel,"The game is booting, this message was for the 25.10 they just didn't removed it",Negative
Intel,I don't know your system specifications but in many cases setting the BIOS to PCIe v4 could help.     Try change in your bios,Neutral
Intel,no I hit alt R opens right away.  And i did an upgrade install over top of 25.10.2 no DDU or AMD clean up utility.  When you say you did a clean install was that just from control panel and remove?,Neutral

Intel,"Wait, chipset drivers uninstall too? I'm going to have to fix that on my system...",Negative
Intel,Do u reintall already up to date chipset drivers?,Neutral
Intel,You should use the Factory Reset installation in the AMD Driver Installer so it removes the newest AMD Adrenalin and install back the correct Adrenalin driver.,Neutral
Intel,"I don't have a DisplayPort to HDMI 2.1 adapter to try, sorry.",Negative
Intel,doing so (separation) will create a freak out shitstorm part 2.,Negative

It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.

Intel,Hi. Did you ever resolve this? I'm getting the same error. Thanks.,Negative
Intel,"Yeah, I'm really starting to lose track of what's going on with AMD. I actually love AMD products, but I'm getting fed up. I've been waiting for a fix for over six months, and it never comes.

Intel,It's a thing you can search for on Google,Neutral
Intel,will it work with current version? Or is it based of some pre-release alpha driver for redstone?,Neutral
Intel,"They promised redstone as a feature for 25h2. So if they dont, that could technically be grounds for a lawsuit",Negative
Intel,ahh i'm on Win 10 so probably why I didn't see it.,Neutral
Intel,Weird. Why is it a Windows fix?   I also got vsync bug in specific games and the weird thing is that I needed to turn on the and perf overlay in order to work,Negative
Intel,"Yes, but was it in the previous WHQL driver ? I'm not sure.",Neutral
Intel,there is an another bug appears in 25.10.2 drvier. 25.10.1 works fine.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1okvkvk/hows\_25102\_driver\_performance\_for\_battlefield\_6/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1okvkvk/hows_25102_driver_performance_for_battlefield_6/),Neutral

Intel,"I tried everything I saw online: meshes on low, XMP lower/off, chipset drivers reinstall and other stuff. Nothing worked.  I downgraded back to 25.9.1., haven't had a crash in days.  Kinda miss the improvements for AFMF they brought with 25.10 for other games, but eh I'd rather play BF6 without it crashing randomly.",Negative
Intel,"Didn't test long enough to see if it crashes as I reverted back to old driver when I noticed my gpu was permanently at 100% load which it never was before on old driver, doesn't feel like it's supposed to do that with a 9800x3d & 9070xt + 32gb ram, It's moving between 70-95% usage on old driver",Negative
Intel,Either launch with curseforge or rollback,Neutral
Intel,"Damn, didn’t work for me last driver either. I can get FSR4 to work in other games just not BF6",Negative
Intel,Sorry for not replying in time with the pictures but I just saw that on Twitter that Beat Saber and AMD are now aware of the issue. The distorted flickering issue on the walls.  https://xcancel.com/BeatSaber/status/1993629046802882685  However there's another issue. I had not actually tried to use an Index at 90Hz until the other day. I discovered that the latency bug is back for 90Hz mode. As in I have to adjust the photon latency to ~5ms in the Steam debug commands to make it usable but not fixed. Just like in the the drivers before 24.12.1.   120Hz mode still works fine.,Neutral
Intel,"Even the rollback doesn't fix it for me now. It being related to the combination of iGPU and GPU makes sense though. Sadly I actively use the iGPU, so thats not an option for me.",Negative
Intel,You 100 procent sure on this?,Neutral
Intel,I went back to 25.3 official gigabyte latest driver for 9070XT OC gaming and 2 days no crashes for now. Also changed HDMI for DP cable  I will also change in BIOS and completely disable integrated GPU in BIOS,Positive
Intel,"I had auto update on (my mistake), so it did install over the previous driver. I've downgraded for now and it seems to be working just fine.  But no, after uninstalling from control panel I booted into safe mod and used DDU.   Then I downloaded the newest installer from the website. Restarting where needed during this process.   Didn't matter how I tried to access the software. Wasn't active in the system tray, not there in task manager.   Right click on desktop and open from there, click the exe, or go into a game and try Alt R. Didn't open with any of these methods.",Neutral
Intel,Driver with -s letter after black screen and reboot PC tells me that this driver isn't for my graphic card🤡,Negative
Intel,"I had randomly black screens with 24.2.1, this was annoying as hell. Had to DDU the Driver and went back to 23.11.1, after this everything was fine.",Negative
Intel,Does fsr 4 work on 25.9.1? I thought the only driver that works without having to change any files and risk a ban online is 23. 9.1?,Neutral
Intel,"I had to rollback to driver 25.9.1, start up Star Citizen, switch the renderer to Vulkan, exit game, start SC again to verify it's working with Vulkan, then reinstall the latest driver again. Now it works, just don't switch it back to DirectX. No idea who dropped the ball on this one but Easy-Anticheat sure doesn't like the atidxx64.dll.",Neutral
Intel,I'm not sure. However when I install the driver it states that I cannot use adrenaline and gives me a link to the newest driver. Wondering if there is an earlier version of adrenaline I need to install.,Neutral
Intel,What do you mean extension update??? Do you mean lg firmware update or something Ina  windows update? Where do I find this?,Neutral
Intel,They do not.,Neutral
Intel,"Well, I used the system before the latest updates normally, for maybe half a year. Installed every update without DDU. I wanted to triple boot, formated the drive, left windows to install stock updates and drivers, went to install chipset and GPU driver and voila, every wakeup, just before I could type the pin, kernel panic and shutdown. DDU, just the driver, installed again, black screen. Went into DDU again, wanted to see if I missed anything and without reading, uninstalled everything AMD related, went into windows, installed chipset drivers from vendors site (ASUS) and then the latest GPU drivers, and havent had issues. I have a monitor connected via DP and a TV via HDMI.",Neutral
Intel,Dont buy an adapter. Most of them are trash and dont put out the advertised resolution and refresh rate. Not to mention most of them dont support vrr or HDR.,Negative
Intel,The one linked in the release notes is combined. (in the sense that it's two drivers in one executable) (And 1.6GB)  .....amd.com/drivers/whql-amd-software-adrenalin-edition-25.11.1-win11-nov-combined.exe,Neutral
Intel,"AND is taking away one additional driver feature per day, you say?",Negative
Intel,"Yes, I’m talking about 25.10.2 (posted the other day here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/s/nNunS1QlFX ). If you go to AMD download page and select “GPU” you get a file that has a different dimension from the one you download if you choose “CPU”. If you do the following steps 1) DDU (or AMD CleanUp Utility), 2) install CPU drivers => GPU not recognized or with a generic driver. If the you install the GPU driver you get the GPU correctly recognized and a yellow esclamation mark on the integrated. To have both VGAs working at the same time I have to download the AMD Auto Detect package (the file name ends with “minimal_install), but Adrenalin App does not open.",Neutral
Intel,Thank you for explaining it before the rage baiters go nuts.,Neutral
Intel,I've been following this one pretty closely. Unfortunately the fix *just* missed 25.11.1 release cycle; we hope to get this out in the next one.,Negative
Intel,"I have a 7900XTX and have this issue at times. It normally clears quickly on its own, but seeing pink pixels on the screen worried me that I had an issue with the actual hardware",Negative
Intel,"I totally understand. if you're running with an affected display config, you should be fine on 25.9.1 or the 25.10.1 preview driver for BF6. We'll get this out as soon as we can.",Neutral
Intel,"Appreciate you reaching out with this - that's an interesting data point to consider.  In this case, the quirky behaviour with HDMI 2.1 + FRL was attributed to a change made in the display stack, I don't think it explicitly involves display stream compression to repro, just high enough display bandwidth (though I could be mistaken)",Positive
Intel,"Interesting. I've been experiencing random BSODs on my PC too on a fresh Win11 install too, I was also suspecting it was something to do with auto HDR toggle but I didn't know for sure.  I'm running 180hz 1440 LG panel but I don't recall if it's using hdmi or DP. I've also never experienced BSODs until the last week or two, since i did a fresh install and I've had the same monitors/PCs for a long time.",Neutral

Intel,"Ah ok, that definitely makes sense if you're using a TV. Hope they straighten it out for you soon.",Neutral
Intel,What I did is get the 25.8.1 drivers shut off the fluid motion frames and in Windows set bf6 to run full power on your graphics card. Try some of those things and see if that helps you.,Neutral
Intel,"I tried to reinstall the chipset drivers, the same error, tried to install the drivers from gigabyte site the second screen worked but uninstalled adrenaline and it ran the auto update that disabled the secondary screen and the issue of no adrenaline opening came back, going back to older version, thanks AMD",Neutral

Intel,For me playing it with path tracing on eventually the game crashes. Had no issues playing with ray tracing: psycho though.,Negative
Intel,Amen to that. Not a single crash since the game released on CachyOS. (9070 XT),Positive
Intel,Thank you! Exciting keen to see what it’s like,Positive
Intel,"It has nothing to do with the lack of vulkan support, even when fsr4 comes to vulkan, the game still needs ray regeneration implementation from the devs, you cant use optiscaler through dlss inputs, like you probably will be able to in fx alan wake 2",Negative
Intel,I suppose is going to be fixed as soon as Amd Redstone go out. Basically is going to add every tecnology that Path tracing needs to work. Off course the devs would have to implement them in the game too,Neutral
Intel,"The issue is if you try to use path tracing. Which to be fair, you probably shouldn't unless the miracle of them getting Virtuous to implement Ray Regeneration in Cyberpunk happens.",Negative
Intel,yes i tried it ... maybe it is because of the 7800X3D ... i really dont know... i will wait for the next patch ... should come tomorrow 18.11. ... but i have read so many threads and i am not the only one...,Neutral
Intel,Hmm fair. For me on 9070XT if I had raytracing enabled it would crash most regularly on loading back to the menu after extraction which was annoying but at least not game destroying lol. But yeah annoying enough that I turned RT off entirely.   I hope this means I can turn it back on because the game runs well enough for it.,Negative
Intel,"Yes. So far, so good. I'm not 100% sure what fixed it.      I uninstalled both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master standalone applications. Deleted the ""amdryzenmasterv"" keys. Rebooted.  Then I installed Adrenalin and used the Ryzen Master installer in Adrenalin (Performance > Metrics > Install Ryzen Master).  I think this problem might have something to do with a handshake breaking between Ryzen Master and Adrenalin, after upgrading just Adrenalin.   From now on, I'll probably do clean installs, removing and reinstalling both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master, through Adrenalin Performance tab.",Positive
Intel,"My last two processors are ryzen amd, my last three video cards are amd radeon and next one will be amd also, nvidia has driver issues as well, to be honest.  But yes, some issues are too annoying and updating drivers is lottery at this point. I would advice against updating drivers unless you need it for specific new game or have the latest video cards - rx 9070 \[xt\]  or 9060 xt .  I should have sold the 7700 xt and bought 9060 xt 16gb instead but too late for that now and it has problems as well, so lottery as i said, its a risk.",Negative

Intel,Which driver version and does it still crashing?,Neutral
Intel,OK I will install it now and test it and get back to you. Give me 10 mins.,Neutral
Intel,Yuppp. It does not work on bf6 but it works on ark survival ascended for me. Seems it might be a bf issue. I saw ppl saying they were getting more fps with this driver in BF6 but I think they didn't realize it's using FSR 3.1 and not 4.,Negative
Intel,I'll work with the engineer from that ticket check if that issue has somehow regressed.,Neutral
Intel,We've not been able to reproduce this internally so far. Can you remind me which GPU (was this a 7900XTX?) + connectivity method you're using?,Neutral
Intel,Try using DDU to uninstall your current drivers and do a clean install of the 25.10.2 combined drivers if you havent already (you can find it here):  https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-25-10-2.html,Neutral

Intel,"whew thanks, good think i noticed it first before updating. i have 25.10.2 and 25.9.2 here and they both have windows 10 along their filename so i might as well asked.",Positive
Intel,I don't see how it would work on 23.9.1 lol,Negative
Intel,"Did you use DDU to uninstall the drivers and then reinstall using a driver installer from the AMD website? I found this guide yesterday and it was extremely helpful, specifically step 8:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1lnxb8o/ultimate_amd_performance_fix_guide_stop_lag_fps/",Positive
Intel,I did it this morning before the new driver and confirm chipset drivers were untouched,Neutral
Intel,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.  More people use HDMI than what people think and those TVs don’t always have a DP connector at all.,Negative
Intel,"ah, that explains it. Thanks. :)",Positive
Intel,"What if one does not check release notes? V25.10.2 point to different packages, for installing both CPU and GPU you had to download the AutoDetect package (named “minimal install”). Obviously I’m referring to AMD driver download page.",Neutral
Intel,"Okay, as long as they have a workaround for that... I was planning to get a 9060XT, but also keep my 6700XT for lossless scaling frame gen, was worried the branching would affect that..",Neutral
Intel,"What a mess. I have rdna2 and 3 on the same PC, so combined driver is the solution for this? Or auto detect is the only way?",Negative
Intel,"Damn, that's a huge relief to hear. Most of the frustration came from not knowing whether the issue was even acknowledged.   Thanks a lot for the update.",Positive
Intel,What about Noise Suppression not working since 25.9.2?,Negative
Intel,Finally. The last driver without pink artifacting was 25.4.1  It has been 7 months. AMD Matt acknowledged the bug on [the amd forums](https://pcforum.amd.com/s/question/0D5KZ000011WpJJ0A0/pink-square-artifacting-chrome-discord-and-steam) 5 months ago.  Please let it be fixed with the next driver update. So many 7000series users are on the verge of swapping to Nvidia.  https://i.redd.it/ywrg9at3lp1g1.gif,Neutral
Intel,"what about whatever changed post 25.3.1 for multi monitors? Any driver 25.3.1 and older i can run my main at 200hz, my side at 165, and my third at 60 without issue. Any driver newer than 25.3.1 and running my main at 200hz then playing a game will cause the second monitor (165hz) to flicker, glitch, and freak out the entire time, until the game on the main monitor is closed. Dropping to 165 on the main monitor down from 200hz \*fixes\* the issue but, i paid for 200hz and would like to be able to actually use it again.  (7700xt system)",Neutral
Intel,Hell yeah 🙂 amd I appreciate you see the issues Iv been a fan boy for a long time and I know it will be fixed,Positive
Intel,"Hi. Sorry, I thought this was pretty common as I've had this issue with two different systems and 3 AMD GPUs across 2 generations. [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1jayump/chrome_full_screen_freezes_after_switching_to_amd/) [Or here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/3890720/parts-of-screen-freezes-when-using-chrome) Chrome (or other Chromium browsers, I've had this happen with Edge too) in fullscreen, with graphics acceleration enabled.   Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind this only actually matters if one protocol or the other is **actually** limiting bandwidth for the [resolution * FPS] you want to display on your monitor  For instance, DP 1.4 can do ~25Gbits/s, which translates to roughly 1440p @ 240fps, or 4k @ 120fps  If you have proper cable into HDMI 2.1, it should be able to do ~42Gbits/s, which would instead be 4k @ 190fps  Read up the wikipedia tables for bandwidth specs and resolution / fps / bit depth rates for more",Neutral
Intel,Yeah most people are still have dp 1.4 monitors though. No way I'm swapping my monitor just for dp 2.1 as it's just too awesome. Although these tandem OLED screens look interesting... Hmm lol,Positive

Intel,Oh that's nice! I'll look into it when I get the chance.,Positive
Intel,Cool. Thank you,Positive
Intel,I might turn on ray tracing in like a medium or low setting just for shits and giggles or screenshots but I don't plan on playing with it on all the time since I'll also play at 1440p so I don't wanna have a really bad experience 😖,Negative
Intel,Exactly! It's insane. I can't believe running through a translation layer is more stable than running native,Positive
Intel,"but i dont know something is also wrong with 25.11.1 ... AMD Adrenalin randomly vanishes from tray     i dont want to roll back to 25.9.1 :-(    but this version was the last which was good so far      maybe when we have luck amd is able to provide next time a ""perfect"" driver without any issues?",Negative
Intel,"Could be it, nothing hardware wise at all and just software too.     Yeah, you're not the 1st I've read that says they have issues on the game.     If you're crashing and the system reboots it does make me think of some stability issues and not really just GPU, but I'm guessing you've already tried stability tests and using the system without OC+A-XMP/EXPO disabled.     Once upon a time I remember reading some people, on other instances and other games, having crashes like that (complete reboot) due to PSU instability as well.     Good luck!",Neutral
Intel,That's strange. My game defaulted to everything maxed out including running ray tracing and I haven't noticed any issues. The game runs incredibly well.  I've got a 5800X3D & 9070XT as well.,Positive
Intel,"Fair enough, and yeah sooner the better for all of us",Positive
Intel,It absolutely could be.  Europe has some pretty good consumer law and promising features that could impact your purchase decision are part of this law.  It can fall under misleading advertisement,Neutral
Intel,"It's not freezing, it's just that the GPU usage is practically at 100% all the time, even with V-Sync enabled. With the 25.9 drivers, this doesn't happen, and the clock speed varies normally, increasing and decreasing as needed when V-Sync is enabled. These 25.10 drivers are causing the GPU to consume more energy unnecessarily.",Neutral
Intel,Fingers crossed,Positive
Intel,"Thanks for attempting to retest.  It's a 7900XTX with an Index connected via DisplayPort. I am on the latest 25.11.1 driver.  I run a monitor at 4k 120Hz 10bpc with HDR Off, which uses DSC, as my main and only display. I tried disabling DSC in the monitor settings which runs at 4k 120Hz 8bpc with HDR Off but I don't think I noticed a change in latency. I thought that DSC on and off on two different devices might contribute to the problem but I'm not sure.   I have also tried running the Index under a RX480 on another PC and I fairly certain the latency looks different under 90Hz and looks similar under 120Hz. Can't play much to test though as an RX480 runs the Index at a very blurry setting. Getting around to doing this test is what took me so long to reply.",Neutral
Intel,Were you able to find the issue?,Neutral
Intel,"Allright ty, will Install new, any differences in performance?",Neutral
Intel,"im running 25.11.1 on win10 7900xt. no problems besides afmf2 breaking the performance overlay, which ive had for multiple updates now",Neutral

Intel,since last BF6 Update i had zero crashes also on 25.11.1,Positive
Intel,"That's not how it works. Small print won't save you from stuff like this, you think that they can stop releasing this software for 2-3 years because some small print said 'Subject to change'?

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative

Maybe they'll improve it by hooking it up to a wider GDDR bus in laptops, similar to how the current PS5 and Xboxes work (IIRC?)",Neutral
Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks. Intel is already moving on it and I think the main thing holding AMD back is that they rely on 3rd parties for memory packaging so the capacity goes to the more lucrative enterprise chips first.",Neutral

What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra.

Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative
Intel,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",Negative

As for A750 performance being worse than a 6800 XT, duh. One card sells for $180, the $450, they are in completely different price and performance tiers.

If Intel can be competitive in the budget market it will at least put a fire under amd to lower their prices/make a better valued product.",Negative
Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't. Problems that Nvidia and AMD both solved decades ago that are holding Intel back in 2024.   It's not a mystery how a GPU should be built but that didn't stop Intel from not figuring it out.,Neutral
Intel,"Installs beta software, proceeds to complain about it",Negative
Intel,Doesn't make it less of a fact that users are experiencing issues and they still paid hard cash for those GPUs.,Negative
Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral
Intel,"This was a graphics card, not a ‘GPU’ in terms that we understand them now, just to bolster the point about how much of a disparity this comparison reveals.",Neutral
Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so? They paid full price for a product and it should work as advertised.  With that said, the issues with Arc are widely known and complaining about it after the fact is a bit sillly at this point.",Negative

It makes me wonder if they have used older drivers, since they don;t even get 60fps rasterized at 1080p in some games.  edit: And I paid much less than the minimum price they are listing, I'd need to check if prices went up - even though computer base suggest that isn't the case.

Somebody else even made a huge post here and on r/linux, phoronix covered it slightly and AMD went into full panic mode, their developer advocate came here and on AMD forums and in emails and made many grand promises.

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Intel,"And I'm over here struggling to keep an Nvidia T4 passthrough to work reliably on Hyper-V to Ubuntu 22.04. :(  Is there a specific software combination that works more reliably than others?   Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.

Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.  You're free to guess what vendor om looking at to replace my CPU with. Damn shame really.",Negative
Intel,"Fact: AMD does not give a shit about any of this.   We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line. If all CDNA customers switch to NVIDIA and those PO's dropped in volume, it might make them care a little bit.",Negative

Intel,"I’ve been buying ATI / AMD since the ATI Rage 128, and I think my next GPU will be Nvidia. I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

[Also i would love to see AMD Gaming YouTube channel to play and livestream Horizon Zero Dawn with HDR turned on in game using AMD relive ](https://i.imgur.com/1RtZtsi.mp4)  Their also way more issues then i just mentioned i have like 41 commonly reported issues from reddit and forums that not been fixed in 24.3.1 and its still going up, some of my own reported issues as well.  I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.  Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical. I guess that's why nobody is already doing it.",Neutral

I think they're the defense of a brand like it they are defending their sports club.  We're stuck between the overpriced that just work, and the nightmare the AMD software overall is. I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?  ""I have had X AMD GPUs, with Y experience in computers, never had a problem!""  Or even better, ""That is because you suck at computers"" said by some NPC that doesn't even know what an OS is..  I really hope your letter gets where it needs to go, and please keep up the good job. I still hope AMD steers in the right direction so it can put Nvidia to shame(I want to believe poster here). Not because I have something against this brand or the other, but because we need competitors, or else you'll end up paying 600$ for a nice system, and 6000$ for the GPU.

My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

Intel,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

Intel,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place. And if this is a feature that they do not want to support, having the documentation needed to self-support the feature.",Negative

As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it.

Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Until I made my prior posts here on r/AMD, AMD were not interested or even awake when it came to these issues. I have had direct correspondence with John Bridgman where he confirmed that GPU reset was not even considered in prior generations.  Of what use are these support contracts and the high cost of buying these cards if AMD wont provide the resources to make them function in a reliable manner.

My gaming stability issues were always caused by unstable RAM timings and CPU OC settings - since I upgraded to an AM5 platform with everything stock, I'm solid as a rock.

From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.  Does AMD need to improve things?  Of course.

I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.

I'd rather turn RT off, as I did in Control (for AMD and Nvidia HW), which actually has decent RT effects.",Negative

Intel,"This thing is absolutely nuts  AMD BTFO unironically, I'm floored. I never, ever would have considered an Intel chip before 2025, now this is the most obvious laptop part ever. AMD is surely sorely regretting recycling the same 780M and 890M chips for another entire gen, betting that Intel would continue stagnating.  This thing is gonna be a monster in handhelds.  I really, really wanted a Strix Halo laptop, but the lack of SKUs, price and the inflexibility with RAM kind of make it unappealing to say the least, not to mention the power draw compared to Panther Lake is unwelcome. These laptops are gonna be probably the best x86 in mobile has eaten in a very long time.  On top of that, it's almost making the 5050 look like a stupid part in a laptop. Why bother when you have a vastly more power efficient iGPU that will handle every desktop workload on top of being viable for gaming?",Negative

Intel,"We’re talking mobile chipsets here, strix halo is what happens when you throw efficiency out the window, with Power (TDP) range, typically from 55W up to 120W. The ultra H 300 has default TDP of 25W, with Maximum Turbo Power (MTP) going up to 65W-80W. Intel has a better design, if they threw 40 XeSS3 cores on it, it would prolly run circles around Strix.",Neutral

Intel,"> (more than) half the price  Have we seen pricing? Not doubting it, I just haven't seen anything personally but probably missed it.  Strix Halo does seem to be a pretty mythical chip due to its price.",Neutral
Intel,Keep in mind that each Xe3 core is about as wide as an AMD WGP. We're looking at 1536 vs 2560 shaders. The B390 is 60% as wide as the 8060S. 20 Xe3 cores would match the 8060S in width. 40x Xe3 is as wide as the 7900GRE.,Neutral
Intel,"Bingo  Strix is also limited by being RDNA 3.5 and no FSR4, so it's rather dependent on raw throughput, and it can't possibly fit in a comfortable handheld that would last for more than an hour and a half under load.  I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage. I hope they keep it up, it would really be cool to see an AMD vs Intel APU console war generation.",Neutral
Intel,It's about 50% bigger die with 1 CCD (which seems comparable CPU performance),Neutral
Intel,"This is a big of exaggeration, as you can see with Nvidia moving to gddr7. While bandwidth has increased substantially, performance is clearly limited by lack of compute power",Negative
Intel,">GPU's will take all the bandwidth you can feed them.   Didn't deny that. But 12 Xe cores is presumably considered the sweet spot, that's all I'm saying. And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.  Besides, Intel already has Nova Lake AX in the backlog, or whatever it's going to be called. Practically intel's strix halo. It'll have Xe3P cores, more powerful than Xe3, thus deemed more worthy of the halo treatment.",Neutral

Another user somewhere else said the 4Xe GPU is 33mm2.   https://x.com/jaykihn0/status/1812898063502938260   And even without the PHYs and NPU, from what I see, Halo's GPU tile is still like almost 3 times as big.

Wildcat lake with its tiny 2Xe GPU is probably going directly into the budget sector.",Neutral
Intel,Good catch.,Positive
Intel,AMD is dormant on the APU space since it had basically the monopoly for x86 because Intel was just bad.  They are taking one of the old Intel's book by releasing rebrands and reashes,Negative
Intel,"> But 12 Xe cores is presumably considered the sweet spot  By what? much larger Xe3 GPU's exist.  We have nothing to compare against in Intel-iGPU-land that has 256bit memory.  Strix Halo die size isn't the metric you want either. It's only 2x the fps (and who knows, panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus, but we'll never know, because Intel won't release a strix halo competitor)",Neutral
Intel,"Halo's die is still quite a bit bigger, but from the Intel side, you need to include IO, GPU and about half of the compute die which has the MCs, encoders / decoders, etc. to match the ""GPU"" die of Halo, so it is more like 200mm² to 300mm² when compared",Neutral
Intel,AMD is paying more attention to NVIDIA for sure. ESP on the data center side.,Neutral
Intel,">much larger Xe3 GPU's exist.  The biggest one for the moment is on Panther Lake X CPUs. I wouldn't know if there's something bigger tbh.  >Strix Halo die size isn't the metric you want either.\\  Sure you can't compare two different architectures. But all I need to know is it's faaar bigger.  >panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus  That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.",Neutral
Intel,"Well Panther uses mixed processes, and hybrid tiles are bound to be a bit less space efficient than putting everything on a single die. And to be fair, Halo GPU uses N4P process while Panther GPU uses N3E So, still not directly comparable.   Gotta say though, Arc's PPA has improved a lot since Alchemist and Battlemage.",Neutral
Intel,"> That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.  Yeah, it doesn't matter how much memory bandwidth you have if the GPU doesn't have the raster performance to keep up with the flow of data. Case and point, AMD's R9 Fury X. Released with 4096bit bus HBM. Had a total memory bandwidth of 512GB/s. Yet the GTX 980 Ti released with a 384bit bus and 336GB/s memory bandwidth and it out performed the Fury X in pretty much everything.   That said, I have no idea how close the iGPU is to being bandwidth bottlenecked at 1080p. But I very much doubt doubling it would also double the frame rate.",Negative

Intel,"I wonder if Valve would be considering Panther Lake for a Steam Deck 2. It sounds like a generational leap from RDNA2 (which is what they were looking for), and can be cheap enough for valve to slightly subsidize the cost.   I guess the main thing is the power envelope. I think Valve is only interested in making handhelds that deal with a 15W TDP or lower",Neutral
Intel,"the handhelds with these chips are going to slap. Also people gotta remember that using upscaling on smaller screens especially 7-9 inch screens is a lot more tolerable.  and these benchmarks are of triple A titles, monster hunter wilds is a dogshit unoptimized game, and people will be playing a mixture of game from older titles, indies, emulation etc.",Positive
Intel,"Series 3 seems like the biggest Intel W in a long while.   Plays AAA games at 45-60fps with upscaling, and all other games at native at 60+. Not to mention this is 50% faster than AMD's equivalent HX370 while being massively more power efficient.   There's also already laptops listed on sites like Best Buy for reasonable prices (sub $1300). Compare this to the AI 395 from AMD that can't be found for less than $2500 while being significantly less power efficient. Granted, that APU isn't really comparable.",Positive

With the current RAM prices I wouldn’t expect any major console style updates until 2027 anyways",Neutral
Intel,Do you think there's any particular reason why they would want to go with ARM? Quite sure Intel proved here that efficiency is essentially equal between both ARM and x86 here,Neutral
Intel,It's hilarious to think Steam would work with Qualcomm.,Neutral
Intel,"Very unlikely. Proton and DXVK work alright with x86 but adding ARM conversion on top is, uh, a **very** poor experience. In fact that first generation of Snapdragon laptops had among the highest return rate of laptops I have ever seen. Amazon [literally warns potential customers](https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/snapdragon-x-powered-surface-laptop-7-gets-frequently-returned-item-warning-on-amazon) about it.  Valve definitely wants a wider adoption rate of SteamOS and ditching x86 is not going to help that. They are **not** Nintendo that can ask devs to target their architecture. It's going well so far because for most games you can just make a standard Windows version, slap Proton and it works within 10% of native performance under optimal circumstances. Anything that can increase incompatibility rate (and it VERY well can, ARM **does not** support AVX2 natively for instance meaning [a lot of games that might have issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/1dekmtz/avx2_game_list/) even starting or underperform).",Negative

Intel,why didn't they do one? Why use tech that is so old?,Negative
Intel,"Even more efficiency that doesn't exist yet. Snapdragon elite can do some heavy workloads for several hours at a time, but it's not powerful enough for heavy gaming. Valve says they know what they want, it's just not ready yet. I think as great as Panther Lake benchmarks are, the biggest complaint of the Steam Deck is still the 2ish hours of battery life in more demanding titles.  With the existence of other handhelds already, I don't think Valve is trying to aim for the beefier spec department here, if it means the same battery life.",Negative

Intel,"Valve's stand-alone VR headset uses Snapdragon, and x86 emulation, so will be interesting to see how well it performs",Positive
Intel,"It depends. For a PC, yes. For a handheld, I don't think so. For the future of enterprise notebooks, probably, especially since Apple has been doing it for a while.",Neutral

Intel,"It's not exactly weird. They went PPC before Intel because powerpc was more effective for workloads most people used macs for. The switch to Intel was just because Intel had node leadership and performance leadership. Instead stick to A-chips for low power mobile where intel gave up on servicing. Intel loses node leadership to TSMC for a long time, Apple moves on to everything in-house is a pretty logical progression.  Apple having bespoke solutions isn't new either. they've been doing it since their G workstation days. Their current situation is pretty much on brand for apple, but the difference is the huge mistakes intel made (particularly firing so many top engineers) that led to staff fleeing to other companies, including leadership at Apple processor design.  basically apple did their own thing as usual and did a great job don't get me wrong, not taking anything away from apple. the biggest difference however was intel's CEO and board destroying the company.",Neutral

That said, I’m pretty skeptical about how realistic that is. **With the recent RAM shortages and rising memory costs**, pricing a new card competitively while still keeping margins doesn’t sound easy at all. Memory is a huge part of the BOM, and we’ve already seen how shortages can push prices up across the board.  So unless Intel is willing to take a serious hit on margins (which seems unlikely), I’m not convinced the B770 will land at a price point that truly shakes up the market.

Intel,"u/Chelostyles Thank you for your inquiry regarding the CPU and RAM upgrade for your Dell Vostro 3670. As much as I'd like to provide my technical insights on this upgrade path, I'm not in a position to provide specific suggestions since this involves hardware modifications to an OEM system.  For the best compatibility outcome and to ensure optimal system performance, I strongly recommend reaching out to your system manufacturer directly. They can provide definitive guidance on supported CPU upgrades (i5-8400 to i7-9700) and maximum RAM configurations for your specific model. We don't want to inadvertently bypass any warranty terms and conditions on your system by providing modification recommendations that might affect your coverage.  Your system manufacturer's technical support team will have access to the exact specifications, BIOS compatibility matrices, and supported hardware configurations for your Vostro 3670 model. They can confirm whether the motherboard supports the i7-9700, the maximum RAM capacity (64GB vs 128GB), and any potential limitations or requirements for these upgrades.  This approach ensures you get accurate, manufacturer-validated information while maintaining your system's warranty protection.",Neutral
Intel,"u/I_like_carsyay  XPS 15 9530 hardware does support Resizable BAR, which is why Intel's system detection shows it as available for both your Arc A370M and Iris Xe graphics. However, the system manufacturer has designed their BIOS interface to prioritize stability and user-friendliness, often managing advanced PCIe features like ReBAR automatically in the background rather than exposing manual configuration options. This approach ensures optimal system performance while reducing complexity for users. I recommend checking for the latest BIOS updates from your OEM's support site and contacting their technical support team, as they would have the most current information about how ReBAR is implemented on your specific model and whether any additional configuration steps are needed to fully utilize this feature.     I've posted an article below in case you haven't yet come across it:  **Helpful Resources:**  *  [What Is Resizable BAR and How Do I Enable It?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090831/graphics.html)",Neutral

Intel,What is taking Nividia so long with the super cards?,Negative
Intel,"Battlemage gpu chips are made through TSMC and Intel is getting screwed on supply, this is why even if the B770 comes it will only be a small amount. Hopefully Intel can put together enough rare earth to pump out discrete Celestial Gpus but it takes time to ramp everything up. In addition Intel has their chiplet design, EMIB that could take off soon. They may be able to bring Apple back into the fold, but let us hope Discrete Arc lives on.

Intel,"If CES 2026 comes and goes without any details for Discrete Arc GPUs then it could be awhile.

Intel,Not sure how the link being European matters. They are European shops and the B60 is in stock.,Neutral
Intel,"We kind of know where it will land. It will be a 3050M level chip, maybe a bit better, but will have improve scaling and frame gen.   8060S is 40 RDNA 3.5 units. One Xe3 unit is about 2.1 RDNA 3.5 units. That put it at about 65% of Strix Halo, though it will have a worse memory bus and no MALL cache. Somewhere in that range.   So that 60% is almost bang on the 3050M. Maybe a bit better. It won’t be like the 4050 but 3050M isn’t bad for an iGPU that fits in a normal socket",Neutral

AMD,"Compared to my 890M based laptop, the 890M numbers here are about 15-20% lower than what I'm seeing at the same settings.  This is likely due to power targets?  Even if the uplift is just 60% instead of 80%, that's still an impressive achievement for the B390M.  It's a shame that AMD appears to have dropped the iGPU ball in 2026.  Relying on the Strix Halo is not an option here.  It's pretty much impossible to find a good laptops that use it.  The upcoming HX470, and still without FSR4, isn't going to close the apparent large gap.  It seems that AMD forgot to stay hungry and they'll end up losing whatever ground that they'd gained in the last few years.  Mind you, Intel is known to play pressure games with laptop makers too in order to limit AMD adoption, which just makes it even crazier that AMD isn't doing what's required to keep the pressure on.",Negative
AMD,"I think the B390 could be faster than even an RTX 5050 35W (As it could beat an RTX 4050 at 60W).       These thin and light laptops that Panther Lake is built for use way underpowered GPUs. Honestly, it makes sense why the Dell XPS 14 only has the B390 graphics. Before it used an RTX 4050, but it ran at just 30W of power.       Now that Integrated Graphics have beat the -50 Tier of GPUs I don't think we'll even see an RTX 6050 or RX 9050",Positive
AMD,"They've basically maxed out the 128-bit normal socket iGPU now.  For them to beat it they need more memory bandwidth - they can put in a bit more cache, but realistically they'll need a quad channel bus (or maybe they can wait for LPDDR6 at 14.4+).  They can probably have a bit more physical room in the next generation of sockets, but without more bandwidth it isn't *that* useful.",Neutral

AMD,They need a 25% IPC increase to get back to the leading edge in CPU and honestly i don't see it with their current architecture. They need a new radical design   Edit: getting downvoted for what?. Currently Apple and QC have a very solid lead.

Intel is really dependent on CCG, it is double in revenue to DCAI. They invest in what makes them money. Compared to AMD, client and DCAI is doing well, for client CPUs and GPUs are doing well, putting no pressure in mobile, in fact their strategy has remained the same in the past couple the years and even if marginally their % share is sufficient for them.

I'd be honestly surprised if Xe3 was worse than their current offerings. I'm sure it still has shortcomings as all Intel GPUs will because they're simply starting fresh, but even my A750 is pretty good right now at playing anything I throw at it.  The only aspect Intel kind of messed up that annoys me is their video encoder, once it gets pegged to 100%, it absolutely tanks your performance on the capture to the point where it skips frames and lags. It never used to do that and the driver also used to include capture software, now they just offload it to people having to download OBS and removed the capture aspect of the driver. Kind of dumb when both NVIDIA and AMD include it as a driver option.",Negative

In practice, it'll be more like trading 2 P cores for 4 lpE cores  edit: to be more specific, In ARL-H, below 5W per core, E cores outperform P cores.

AMD,"They announced a first party Strix Halo PC at CES, but it'll probably be really expensive.",Neutral
AMD,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips. But if you want true performance, just go out and buy an RTX X060 series laptop it's far better price to perf each generation.",Neutral

I hope people aren't buying it just on desperation and FOMO and not taking newer platforms into account. If its a good deal for the performance, then good.

AMD,I think a decent chunk of people are sitting on a system that already has the amount of DDR4 RAM they want but isn't maxed out on CPU power for what Zen 3 can offer.  Tossing something like a 5700/5800X3D into your existing system looks fairly attractive at present for that sort of user if they can bring those back at a reasonable price point. (and those still sell on Ebay *used* for more than their last retail price).  I don't know that there's going to be a ton of people looking to do a full new build AM4 system at this point if they don't already have RAM for it.,Neutral
AMD,"For better or worse, there are plenty of fast DDR4 in the used market, and CXMT has been making DDR4 for a while now and is a source of DDR4 modules that will at least fulfill demand in China, and thus alleviating demand elsewhere even if they don't make it out.  On top of makers now stopping to retire their DDR4 lines due to the shortage, I think that it would at least be better than DDR5.",Positive

AMD,One that conveys a massive disappointment and fear for the future of hardware.,Negative
AMD,"AMD would need to redesign the memory controller to be compatible with DDR4 and motherboard makers would have to make DDR4 AM5 motherboards. Easy, technically speaking. But then that redesign, tape-out, validation, etc. all takes time and costs lots of money. DDR4 can cost just as much as DDR5 and it doesn't seem like DDR4 supply will go anywhere but down, so this effort would only make sense for the budget-oriented people reusing the RAM they already own. And while the RAM situation is horrible, it's not going to last forever. It may take several years for the situation to ease if things continue the way they are. Or the bubble may pop next week and take memory prices down with it.  So the biggest consideration is money and whether AMD thinks it's worthwhile to spend it chasing a pretty small market that may no longer exist by the time product is available.",Neutral
AMD,"Would make more sense to go the other way around, design new I/O die and then put Zen5 on AM4. The way you said would need new chipset, new motherboards and a new I/O die. Putting it on AM4, in theory all you would need is a new I/O die. You'd still be stuck with DDR4 and PCIe Gen4 and the other platform limitations on AM4/x570/b550/etc, but that's the tradeoff there.",Neutral

We're in a small window where it's actually a good time to upgrade if you live near a Microcenter.",Neutral
AMD,"But that's more due to lack of demand and retailers happy to let their stored inventory dwindle as they predict demand will only further reduce. If people actually start buying it again it'll shoot up as new supply would be near nonexistant.  This is more for the last people who are still sitting on an earlier ddr4-based chip (or platform in the Intel case) to reuse that memory and give up on waiting for an entire platform refresh to ddr5.  I'm more surprised they're thinking of this for what is pretty much the x3d boost - as there's still plenty of stock of zen3 parts lacking that, and those prices haven't increased *that* much to suggest they're nearly out of stock.",Negative

AMD,"Same here, got an X370 board, a Ryzen 1800X and 16 GB of DDR4-3000 back in 2017. Then I upgraded to a 3800X and then to a 5950X and 32 GB of DDR4-3600. Still on the same, now 9 years old motherboard.  If AMD were to put out a 5950X3D I guess I could use it for another 5+ years.",Neutral
AMD,"Regular Zen3 is still great for gaming, it just gets overshadowed by X3D (for good reason). Hardware Unboxed recently did a comparison of several different Zen3 CPU's.  Also keep in mind many CPU gaming benchmarks are done at 1080p or even 720p with something like a 4090. In reality, for a budget DDR4 build you're more likely to use a much lower tier GPU, while running games at 1440p (1440p monitors are nearly the same price as 1080p these days) so the difference won't be as exaggerated.",Positive
AMD,"That's not a 'big' step up.  That's a pretty mild step up.    Most people dont upgrade their CPU every new generation, and that's basically all this is effectively.  The only real consolation here is that Zen 3 CPU's pass muster in modern games better than Zen 2 CPU's do.  So for that I can understand it, but you're only doing it to get over a line, not because it's actually a big improvement.",Negative
AMD,The irony of AMD's best AM4 gaming CPUs having a single CCD is so thick you could cut it with a knife.,Negative
AMD,"How's the 5900XT feel compared to the 5600X?  I'm still sitting on my 5600X and don't generally need more cores, but would still like a performance boost. Kind of an ironic situation to be in as the 5600X was originally the better buy at the time because it had the highest single core/thread clocks.",Neutral
AMD,"So in terms of value and upgradability, what's a better platform in your opinion?   I had issues sure (first gen was flaky with ram), but as an early adopter still using my motherboard from 2017, with a 3900X, and still having an upgrade path, I've gotten my moneys worth.",Neutral

AMD,I don't think I get your point.  That's only true because the only V-cache models released on AM4 had a single CCD.,Neutral
AMD,"The 5900XT has twice as much L3 cache and higher clocks, it's a little better. If you don't need more cores I wouldn't bother.  I also wonder about the 5600x (and 7600x/9600x). 6C/12T doesn't seem much but they seem to do well anyway. I wonder at what point of background tasks the 8 core chips start to become a noticable improvement.",Neutral
AMD,"oh i meant to say my server still runs the 5600 and i want a 5900, but id assume beefy for multicore apps and a little better on single core.",Neutral
AMD,How are your USB ports and wifi/bluetooth?,Neutral
AMD,"First gen was flaky for a number of reasons.  Another is that many people who bought boards for Zen 1 were shit out of luck if they wanted to upgrade to Zen 3.  Zen 1 was also fairly lackluster in terms of single thread performance, and main selling point was really just being able to have a 6 or 8 core CPU at a more affordable overall price point.  Which was great dont get me wrong, but Intel CPU's were still pretty clearly faster in almost all cases at the time for gaming.  Zen 2 was AM4's real arrival in my opinion, helped a lot by Intel stumbling off a cliff at the time.  But if you got in with Zen 2, then your upgrade path was ok, but it wasn't half as miraculous as people make it out to be unless you went for Zen 3 Vcache parts specifically.    AM4 was definitely good and worthwhile, but there's certainly a bit of overselling the narrative here.",Negative
AMD,Right now? AM5. Upgradability is really a blown out or proprtion thing. Less than 1% of ethusiasts (let alone average users) will ever replace a CPU on same platform. By the time people upgrade they will buy a new socket.,Negative
AMD,"Sell on eBay? No thanks. Too easy to get scammed. Cash in hand only.   Also, and I swear this is unrelated to my distaste for selling personal items on eBay, the last time I tried to sell something on eBay they banned my account. No warning, no nothing. The account that was over 15 years old, but had only purchased items. An item I took my own pictures for, wrote all the descriptions for. Nothing copy/pasted into the item listing.

AMD,"AM5 is significantly more expensive, both motheboards and CPUs. Its more performant yes. But I'm not asking for what is the most performant platform today is. I'm asking what other platform in history provided better value over time than AM4. Upgradability is important to me.",Negative

AMD,"Even if that claim were overstated by 2x, would still be a colossal L for amd.",Negative
AMD,Xps is a huge seller for Dell and they are straight up using Panther Lake and XE3. They are exclusively going intel. Intel is 100% securing up there dominance in Labtops. In the process also taking business away from Nvidia.,Positive
AMD,I hesitate to trust Intel's charts. But I am interested if Intel will actually get companies to adopt panther lake for their handheld pc. They did not have much luck with lunar lake.,Negative
AMD,"Assuming intel also keeps those mobile CPUs a good price, this could be really good. Hopefully as well they add the B390 in their high power desktop CPUs, seeing a core ultra 5 with an iGPU like this would really mitigate the need for a dedicated GPU right away Mostly because iGPUs on other generations were bad, and only a select few Ryzen CPUs had the 890M.

Imagine a hx370 with 26cu instead of 16, that's the price range you're lookin at  Any system built with this is gonna need to run at extremely high mem speed to feed the really large igpu which in the current market with insane ram prices is gonna be priced out of most people's budget. Are ya prepared for a gaming handheld that costs north of $1500?

AMD,Crazy AMD haven't updated their iGPU to RDNA 4. I know they're probably waiting for UDNA but it would have been almost 3 years on the same architecture by the time we get the UDNA refresh next year (if they even bring it to their APUs right away). Sort of disappointing.,Negative
AMD,"tbf the most important issue is, few games implemented XeSS, just like AMD FSR.  And I think XeSS 3 being implemented in more games is a net positive for AMD GPU too.",Positive
AMD,"With everything happening around NVIDIA´s price increases and AMD´s lack of providing updates where it hurts, it **feels like** AI-Datacenters are more important right now for them (like the last 2 years).  But who can resent them as Intel had products that where not so much competitive that time.    Arrow lake (Desktop) at least closed on efficiency, but lacks a bit of gaming performance still, hopefully Nova Lake will be the step required to push more competition.   On GPU the same, AMD does not compete with NVIDIA in higher segments while NVIDIA is fairly comfortable with their setup and increases prices because they want to milk customers to increase their ridiculious margins (up to 70%) that they are used to from AI-Chips.   And now Intel also provides Multi-Frame generation, while a niche for me still, starting to compete with AMD and closes up to NVIDIA in terms of Software support, which they lacked the most and fixes a lot of problems.   Now let them release a B770 that is rumoured to be fairly mid/high range and we can hope for competition that actually learned from bad products recently and tries to make it better.",Neutral

AMD,What do you mean that a refreshed Strix Point can’t compete with an updated architecture?,Neutral
AMD,"I got downvoted everytime I brought this up, but this is precisely why Nvidia wanted a deal to have an Nvidia iGPU tile on an Intel APU: Large iGPUs in thin and lights are going to get good enough over the next few years to make them the new entry-level graphics option for people. This directly threatens Nvidia's consumer laptop volume in the entry segment. Intel is claiming close to 4050 performance at this lower TDP, and that's certainly good enough for many to not have the tradeoffs of having a dGPU in their laptop.  If the new market is moving towards putting GPUs on the CPU package instead of discretely on the board, Nvidia doesn't want to place all of their hopes on WoA becoming better, and are hedging by doing both their own SoC *and* an x86 APU with Intel.  The XPS line dropping Nvidia discrete all together is proof of this. In these sub 70W total laptop power markets, a discrete GPU is just eats into the power budget too much.",Neutral
AMD,"In the ultraportables market (like XPS), integrated graphics just make so much sense (energy envelope; cooling system required; battery life; etc); and that's already substantial and before considering the cost of a NVIDIA mobile dGPU itself.  I don't understand why AMD decided to price Strix Point and Strix Halo so ridiculously -- it's their market for the taking.",Neutral

AMD,"I'm just curious how they handle the need for such high speed RAM on desktop though? I guess this is an application where CAMM2 will be required, I don't think DDR5-9600+ is possible without it and this is presumably pretty key to the performance.",Neutral
AMD,"It certainly would make a huge difference because iGPUs are very memory bandwidth bound; and as the name suggests, LPDDR5 9600 has literally twice the bandwidth of the JEDEC standard 4800.  Unfortunately I doubt we'll see reasonably priced laptops with LPDDR5 9600 -- even as an add-on option. I've been eyeing Dells and Lenovos, and basically all SKUs that previously had 6000 are getting substituted with 4800; and many SKUs that were 2x16GB are now 1x16GB; yes **single channel**.... they charge you extra if you want 2x8GB.",Neutral

AMD,??? lunar lake has already shown to be faster than the 890m.  73 percent though seems like a bit much since panther lake was claimed to be around a 50 percent increase over lunar lake,Neutral
AMD,Example?,Neutral
AMD,"They did make a graph specifically to compare the performance of HX 370 and this Arc B390 while they were both using 2x upscaling, which is where this 73% number comes from. In another graph featuring supposedly ""native"" 1080p, they claimed Arc B390 was 82% faster than the HX 370 (why don't they just call it Radeon 890M though...)",Neutral
AMD,"No, intel claims 73% with upscaling (both) and 82% native",Neutral
AMD,"If it was only a 73% gain *including* MFG, then that would be a serious performance regression. If they were using MFG in their graphs, it would easily be 200% - 300% ""faster"" at the same ""real"" performance",Negative
AMD,"The graphs all listed games and I didn't see any synthetic benchmark scores were listed, so yeah.",Neutral
AMD,The relative proportion of the die isn't as important as the die size itself and the node ofc.   Lunar lake for example has an estimated die size smaller than the hx370 so even if they did make the die bigger I don't think that is going to massively raise the price. Not to mention intel owns the foundry unlike AMD who are outsourcing to TSMC. This isn't in the realm of a strix halo competitor with a 300 mm\^2 + die size.   Dell for example has already refreshed the XPS line with intel panther lake and cut out the option for a dedicated gpu.,Neutral
AMD,"There are 50% more GPU cores here than on Lunar or Arrow Lake. CPU is still 16 cores as well compared to Arrow Lake, just shifted from 6+8+2 to 4+8+4.",Neutral
AMD,"Do you mean Strix Halo?  Halo is made up of THREE dies. Two are regular CCD and one is a ~300mm2 graphics die. Total die area is around 440mm2 IIRC.  It's expensive, but not THAT expensive.",Neutral
AMD,Doesn't this depend on use case? AMD laptops are more capable for gaming and the iGPU can also use the lesser version of FSR. Intel is obv better for productivity.,Positive
AMD,"I disagree, Arrow lake HX seems to be more expensive than AMD HX as least on Lenovo Legion Pro setup.   I would have buy Arrow lake for the same price but AMD is cheaper by $200.",Negative

AMD,"Lmao check the data, Intel has 79% of the laptop market share currently",Neutral
AMD,"Reddit isn’t indicative of anything really, most casual laptop buyers don’t even know what AMD is.",Negative
AMD,"I wouldn't be surprised if this is because the team has chosen to focus efforts on UDNA because that's the architecture next-gen consoles would use.

AMD,AMD is planning on again using RDNA 3.5 on their next mobile chips as well.,Neutral
AMD,Not an ideal solution but Optiscaler exists,Negative
AMD,"NVIDIA has increased margins but they haven't been that terrible. Part of the compounding issue at play is limited TSMC capacity; with both gaming and DC on the same TSMC node.  Ampere (crypto bubble ignoring) was priced well and many excellent cards in there since it was on Samsung, a cheap fab; while DC/workstation chips got TSMC.",Neutral
AMD,Who said anything about basing the entire product stack around handhelds?,Neutral
AMD,"That's not quite right. Power levels are determined by the frequency of a given CPU core. The LPE cores in Lunar and Panther lake both clock up to 3.7 GHz, so given the added IPC of the new Panther lake e-cores and better process node, it is more efficient.

AMD,Xe3p was alr confirmed coming im sure Celestial happens,Neutral
AMD,"We will see, while Intel's PR and marketing is extremely confusing, Intel did confirm Xe3P will come to desktop; and at least from driver updates (as a very happy B580 owner) driver support has been constant and lively.  I had some issues with an older Civ game, I reported an issue in [their app](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000057021/graphics/other-graphics.html) with screenshots/etc, and while I never got any notification, the game works perfectly now a few months later. Dunno if they read those reports, but my card keeps getting better.  I actually think a MSRP B580 is another card that will age like fined wine -- YMMV depends on games you play, but in Australia they have been regularly sold slightly below international MSRP and represent phenomenal value in the price class.",Positive
AMD,That's bloody good for an iGPU. It's been nice to see them finally get to respectable performance over the last few years. Intel in particular has really upped their iGPU game & it shows.,Positive
AMD,not to mention it is a little skewed as they threw in a title which pushed the vram limit on the 4050 making the b390 over 800 percent faster in that title which obviously messes with the average.,Negative
AMD,It's 10% faster geomean across 45 games,Positive
AMD,That can be resolved if either Intel or AMD decides to unlock quad-channel on consumer chips and mobos. It's artificial market segmentation; the die area needed to deliver more (LP)DDR5 channels is absolutely minuscule; for a huge boost in iGPU performance.,Neutral
AMD,Cache. Lots of it.,Neutral
AMD,"They are using 9600mt/s lpddr5x, could also have a lot of cache, (iirc 890m configs were nerfed in cache because they wanted to put a npu instead), and also could be a synthetic benchmark or specific game that isn't very bandwidth heavy.",Neutral
AMD,Panther Lake still has a 128 bit memory bus so only models with 9600 mt/s will get slightly faster shared memory bandwidth than Lunar Lake.   I wonder how this will manifest in games as the only performance leaks have been from Geekbench and 3DMark which may not be as bandwidth intensive as real games and applications.,Neutral
AMD,"This seems to be correct, since checking NotebookCheck for the 30 watt 4050 shows that it’s around 70% faster than the HX370 in games, which is roughly where Intel places their iGPU.  The performance difference between a 30 watt 4050 and full 140 watt 4050 is around 41 percent performance based on Time Spy",Positive
AMD,"basically cheating tho, rtx cards in dell laptops are barely getting enough watts to even turbo",Negative
AMD,"That's the only way to do a fair comparison, really.   Because the 45 watts that Intel chip uses is shared for the entire chip.   So it's still 45w Intel + igpu vs 60w Intel+gpu",Neutral
AMD,"It’s a super strong generational gain though, it’s like the jump from Vega 8CU to rdna2 12CU. The kind of single gen gain you see once in 5 years at most",Positive
AMD,The thing about that... what sort of tile are we expecting them to package up? As you say if we can get 4050ish performance from an Intel iGPU then they really can't be far off 5050M... and maybe even 5060M performance in future.  Do you think they'll offer something like a 5070 tile? that almost seems excessive (and difficult to actually package from a thermal point of view in a laptop) but it seems like the 5050/5060 sort of tier is going to be pretty well covered as a traditional iGPU soon.,Neutral
AMD,AMD actually introduced lower tier Strix Halos in this CES; and the first budget laptop thats gonna use it is [the Asus TUF A14](https://youtu.be/h27w0PXFBgk?si=Pa7UQhinywF-uFMj&t=306),Positive
AMD,They're a lot more accurate than whatever the fuck Nvidia has been doing where you have to decode their bar graphs for proper scaling lmao,Negative
AMD,"I'm pretty sure Intel threw lots of ""marketing money"" for the MSI Claw too.

AMD,> Lunar Lake was a expensive product which didn't make sense in handhelds   What do you mean? All the tradeoffs LNL made were pretty good fits for a handheld.,Neutral
AMD,"I don't think that will really be an issue, laptops can be configured with soldered 8 channel RAM like AMDs Z2 extreme, or they can still manage easily with regular DDR5 6400Mhz sodimms, which run at 102.4GB/s  Plus the CPUs that have intels new B390 iGPU are 4P/8E CPUs, so I doubt there will be much issues from low ram speeds.

AMD,"The majority of the lineup still only has 4. Will be interesting to see what the pricing and performance is on those since these will likely be quite limited. What's also a bit crazy is there's three different nodes being used for the various GPUs, and the full 12 unit one is probably on N3.",Neutral

AMD,"Different poster than OP.  Compute tile on Lunar Lake is 140mm2 on N3E with a small 46mm2 controller N6 tile. Strix Point (HX 370) as a whole is 233 mm2 on N4P. Lunar Lake is clearly cheaper, but given the newer node and packaging not massively so, likely by around 20-25%.  Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins. For all purposes it's an accounting trick to hide CCG's and DCAI's 5-15% operating margins if you divide the foundry losses per group revenue.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, although the actual low power 8 core successor to Lunar Lake is the 335/365 with half GPU cores and slower RAM.",Neutral
AMD,"even if you exclude the CPU CCDs the graphics die alone is bigger than a RTX 5070Ti mobile GPU, which also retails for \~$2000-$3000, same as Strix Halo laptop",Neutral
AMD,"This is slightly splitting hairs but the 8c CCDs in Strix Halo is actually NOT the same chiplet as the ones in desktop zen 5 parts. It iirc is produced on a smaller node, slimmed down, and has different ( or no) TSVs.  It is similar to design and cache sizes to desktop however, but the changes to the CCDs were done to improve low power performance characteristics. They are likely a bit more expensive than Desktop CCDs.  I believe it is discussed in a chips&cheese deep dive.",Neutral
AMD,"AMD have largely been ""winning by doing nothing"" due to their better driver support stack for gaming on iGPUs, rather than actually throwing superior hardware at it.  It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.  Given how effective DLSS is on the Switch2, one could only imagine how kickass a Nvidia chip in a handheld PC could be with the far more ubiquitous DLSS support.",Neutral
AMD,Now they are not. The panther lake igpus are undisputed winners (excluding the 395+ from amd since it's just not gonna be mainstream). You can get a 358H or 368H and you'll have solid laptop for igpu gaming far cheaper than the 395+,Positive

AMD,"Well you said it, it's TSMC capacity, meaning also a priority issue. They prioritize AI over consumers and then increase the price by reducing availability, meaning the same chip costs more, meaning more margin.  Seeing they increase the 5090 to roughly 5k (USD) is just the beginning and as I know all companies will use the increasing memory prices to say they must increase the product price, just not proportional to the memory costs.  next step: then they will use this to move more to streaming instead of owning",Neutral

A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.  Sorry for the rambling.",Neutral

AMD,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW? But yeah high end perf scaling falls apart at sub 4K internal res.",Negative

AMD,It looks decent to me but I wonder if with it being user replaceable I wonder if it could be modded to have mechanical keys.,Positive
AMD,No different than plugging a keyboard to a laptop for the same reason,Neutral
AMD,"But it doesn’t. In a workplace, people don’t care, and even go out of their way to buy even worse keyboards that only fit an aesthetic.",Negative
AMD,"I saw a reviewer trying the keyboard, and he mentioned that it felt marginally better than a regular laptop keyboard. It makes sense, laptops have to sacrifice some ergonomic features of keyboards. This might not be as bad as people say.",Positive
AMD,I just don't see it. Its a laptop except it has no built in screen. That's just a worse experience all around. For the use cases described by you and the article... basically everyone will just opt for a laptop.,Negative
AMD,My company has a fleet of aging thin clients. These are quite literally drop in replacements since the screens are fine.,Neutral
AMD,"Would it really be that different compared to a 12/13"" laptop? Or even a tablet?",Neutral
AMD,It could make for an amazing home entertainment center though.,Positive
AMD,"""500 bucks for a keyboard?!""",Negative
AMD,"Yup, especially with how good USB-C docks can be these days. One cable to plug in, completes power, display out, keyboard, mouse, microphone, etc…",Positive
AMD,"It would probably be easier to “deconstruct” a mini PC and mod it onto your preferred mechanical keyboard base, than to mod mechanical keys on this based on the slimness.",Neutral
AMD,"If it's as good as a ThinkPad's, I would have no complaints tbh.",Positive
AMD,"Me who always plugs my laptop into my desktop setup without ever flipping it open to use the screen...  A surprising amount of people will enjoy not needing to carry that screen around between home and work, as they just need a portable databox, and a laptop is actually the worse experience.  There's a definite place for this product in the market.",Positive
AMD,Yeah I think so too and it makes this product meaningless.,Negative
AMD,"This isn't meant to replace laptops but thin clients often used in business offices.  One downside I see there is that VESA mounted thin clients can be more easily locked in place to prevent theft or tampering.     I have seen a surprising number of business users who are given a laptop... and also monitors and a docking station, and the laptop is only ever used plugged in.  This keyboard pc to be useful to them and not waste money on an unused laptop screen, but they would first need to recognize the issue",Neutral
AMD,Could be really neat combined with next gen AR glasses if they have sufficient pixel density for text-based workspace applications.,Positive
AMD,500 bucks won't even cover the 64GB RAM in this. It wouldn't surprise me to see $1500 for this.,Negative
AMD,Can easily spend this on a custom mechanical keyboard,Neutral
AMD,norbauer obliterates the chat,Neutral
AMD,"Nah this density is very good and in a perfect shape, what will most likely happen is people 3D print a mechanical keyboard compatible case with it.",Positive
AMD,"Keep in mind the screen, and surrounding enclosure and hinges for durability add a lot of weight.",Neutral
AMD,Pretending that the screen somehow makes a laptop harder to carry is wild stuff.  I'm confident in saying this product will never see a second generation.,Negative
AMD,"This is definitely not meant to replace thin clients. Look at the specifications of it....  Also, the ""wasting money on a screen"" is really a very minimal expense that the moment a user does need to move their computer pays for itself instantly.",Negative
AMD,"It's a huge amount of people.  At work, we have so many of these little databoxes that we plug into a monitor and keyboard. Small, portable, gets the job done, easy to replace and fit in all situations.  These would be a very nice drop-in replacement for those. These aren't designed for individual buyers, though they certainly won't mind the sales. It's more targeting corporate deployments where a company will want to buy hundreds to thousands or more, have them easily stored in a warehouse that can quickly be deployed when needed. When a computer for work breaks, I let my project manager know and they'll contact logistics to organize a swap, happened a few times last year and recently just had to swap a computer out due to a broken power button. These are super convenient for such cases, especially with office work where they take way more abuse as they remove the fragile screen + hinge on laptops if they're gonna be used in a situation where nobody cares about them.  My main concern is the keyboard. In office, keyboard and mouse are replaced all the time, so having one tied to the rest of the hardware is problematic. Companies often favour buying the cheapest en-masse and replace when broken, as hiring someone to fix expensive stuff that nobody cares about is not cost efficient. Yes you can just plug a new keyboard in, but I do have a bit of e-waste concern if some companies simply decide to throw them out due to speed/efficiency, kinda like how mostly fine laptops that have some broken bits are sadly discarded all the time by companies.  Then again, throwing away this is less wasteful and cost efficient than throwing away a laptop, so maybe it's still net better.",Positive
AMD,The laptop screen is definitely useful once you have to go into a conference room. The cost savings might be pretty marginal given the economies of scale for laptops,Positive
AMD,"This is aimed at businesses. Nobody buying these new will be interested in modding to that extent.   Not to mention that if you're going to replace the only thing that makes this PC special, there's no reason to start with it. Just grab any laptop motherboard or a mini PC",Negative
AMD,Yee,Positive
AMD,"It’s 760 grams or something. That’s quite significant to certain people. I mean it’s not hard to carry, but any lighter weight in my backpack is always welcome.   I hear your skepticism though. Let’s see if this finds a market. I hope it does, because one of the nice things about PCs is the wide range of form factors — laptops, convertibles, mini PCs, compute sticks, to full desktop builds — and it’s nice to have options in the market.",Positive
AMD,"The keyboard is replaceable according to the press release, but no details on how.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, definitely true for the people who might end up presenting or needing to work on the laptop during a meeting.  But offices also often have many people who will never need that and can use cheaper devices",Neutral

AMD,I had the fastest gaming CPU in the world for 2 weeks,Positive
AMD,"Could be worse, you could be a threadripper customer.",Negative
AMD,"I don’t quite understand HUB’s hubbub here.  AMD stumbled upon a handful of higher-binned chips and decided to spin them off into a slightly higher-tier SKU.  That’s not exactly… unorthodox.

But sure, let’s write a whole song and dance about it.   That’s what modern tech journalism is about, I imagine.",Neutral
AMD,"back in the days intel and amd released the same cpus but the higher ends usually had simply higher frequency so for avg joes it was easy peasy, but for enthusiasts it meant they could buy the lowest sku of that u-arch and just oc it.  So it is basically a return to the old, just oc your old 9800x3d and u are there.  mine is ticking at 5.6 all cores locked all the time in all gaming worklaods.",Neutral
AMD,I don't see how it's milking unless it's more expensive **and** they stop selling the original. As long as they keep selling it alongside then who cares,Negative
AMD,"I don't understand how this is milking - at least compared to the amount of milking that goes on across the industry, where paying a premium for largely irrelevant performance gains is the standard, not the exception.  What I really wonder is what amount of overhead these chips will have - I'm guessing they won't be able to keep up with the PBO / CO capabilities of the average binned 9800X3D, making them even less appealing to enthusiasts.  Looking forward to seeing what they are capable of.",Negative
AMD,HUB continues to milk AMD.,Negative
AMD,What does this equate to… +3 fps @4k max settings?,Neutral
AMD,If they would have simultaneously launched a 9750x3D for the lower binned parts I wouldn't be this disappointed.,Neutral
AMD,Plenty of people will pay for +7%.,Neutral
AMD,"I just bought a 9800x3D it's still in the box, should I return it? Is this even going to be a noticeable difference?",Negative
AMD,It's a little refresh within the same gen and it's not like it's targeting 9800x3d users anyways so... Milking??,Neutral
AMD,"JSH said in his presentation that Moore's law has stopped delivering the goods on speed so Nvidia has to redesign every part of their whole system stack to get performance increases.  That maps onto AMD's dilemma with these CPUs perfectly.  They have run out of ways to make a single generalist part give big performance increases at the same price point.  Nvidia's trick was to get you to buy a $400 GPU on year 1, a $800 GPU on year 3, a $1600 GPU on year 5, etc",Negative
AMD,Interested to see if it has the random combustion issues as the last one.,Neutral
AMD,"Yea they did, this “milking gamers” thing is so odd. It’s like saying Nvidia is milking when releasing the super series.   It’s replacing the 9800X3D and making it better.",Negative
AMD,The internet is full of impatient people who don't understand how things work,Negative
AMD,Also like it's normal to have multiple of the technically same configuration but at different clock speed for CPU. Intel and amd have done this for decades,Neutral
AMD,"There's a weird round of negative sentiment about AMD right now.   On the GPU end, people are pointing to the new DLSS 4.5 and saying, ""Look at this! Nvidia is supporting all of their GPUs with this while FSR4 only works on RDNA4!""   Mind you, RTX3000 GPUs that were new in 2022 have never seen any sort of frame-gen support from Nvidia. You had to rely on AMD's FSR3 or Lossless Scaling if you wanted that.   And multi-framegen (including the DLSS 4.5 flavor) are for the newest Nvidia cards only.",Negative

AMD,What was wrong with threadripper?,Negative
AMD,"Honestly, I haven’t been able to watch alot of the hardware YouTubers rage bait the last few weeks as all their videos are ‘is gaming dead’ ‘is PC hardware over’ ‘RAM destroying PC’ etc. I feel like it’s the same content over and over from a hand-full of YouTubers saying the same thing.",Negative

AMD,Let the milking begin!,Positive
AMD,"What? They didn’t run out of ways.  No it’s because CPUs for AMD have ~2year release cadences and that AMD needed something to “keep the crown” from Intels 2026 offerings until they can get Zen6 parts available.   Same with laptop, refresh the lineup with better clocks, improved firmware etc until the next gen CPU Engine is ready.   For Nvidia, it’s because they do yearly GPU releases, but their other components typically are kept and used for multiple years.  This just happens to be the year that “everything” in their system is going new.  Next year Nvidia will keep everything but the GPUs.   AMD too is making all new chips for their Helios platform using MI450s, Venice Zen6, and Vulcano AI NICs along with new Scale-Up and Scale-Out switches from a switch vendor.",Neutral
AMD,"This has nothing to do with AMD (or perhaps TSMC) hitting a silicon barrier.  It’s simply silicon binning, where higher quality dies are allocated to higher-tier SKUs, a concept HUB seemingly isn’t familiar with.  Besides, N2 is a major leap over the ongoing N4, and while it’s true that Moore’s Law is no longer in effect, N2’s transistor density advantage over N4 is seemingly sufficient for AMD to not only improve IPC on the upcoming Zen 6 (which almost always costs transistors) but also increase the core count by four per CCD.",Neutral
AMD,Moores law was never about performance...,Negative
AMD,"The absolute highest outlier is 6% Even in games they cherrypicked to show benefit most are less than 3%. In some cases like battlefield 6 literally 0%  This is AMD’s testing which I wouldn’t call rigged, but it’s going to be the absolute best results they can put forward.  I don’t really care other than AMD constantly makes the naming scheme awful for uninformed consumers.",Negative
AMD,"The most positive reaction to a Super refresh was that ""this is closer to what they should have released in the first place"".  There has been calls of milking customers with Super releases before too.",Positive
AMD,"Super series *usually* gives us more than just a minor clock boost, at least.  And tend to provide a general value boost by slotting in at previous price points, rather than stacking on top.   Also, people never had any problem criticizing Intel for milking people with similar sorts of 'refresh' releases.  Dont see why AMD should be off-limits.    The pricing will be the main thing.  If this thing comes with a somewhat tall premium and costs $550+, then yes, it's pretty much the definition of milking consumers.",Neutral
AMD,"Well super series have historically given meaningful improvements in value.   Like the 4070S was around 20% faster than a 4070 for the same MSRP. The 4070 TiS was 10-15% faster than a 4070 Ti at the same MSRP, and the 4080S was around 3% faster for $200 lower MSRP.   That's different than releasing an overclocked CPU with insignificant performance improvements at a higher MSRP.",Positive
AMD,They’re also making it more expensive.,Negative
AMD,"Audience loves the, ""greedy corpos are cheating you,"" angle though.",Negative
AMD,"Its replacing 9800X3D and it's resetting the price for minor clock improvements (maybe 2-3% faster), which means 9800X3D will be discontinued, soar in price - so either 499 for 9850x3D or around the same (maybe more for 9800X3D new/second hand.  It's milking at its finest.",Neutral
AMD,they slightly typoed the headline. Youtubers Milking gamers slightly faster.   Its like you said nothing its fluff but they need that ad revenue,Neutral
AMD,>  It’s like saying Nvidia is milking when releasing the super series.   thats what this sub said when the 4000 series supers released...,Neutral

AMD,If the super series was 2% faster then yes?  What would you call milking a consumer?  When intel spent a decade releasing 4 core cpus with 5% increases was that not milking their consumers?,Neutral
AMD,"so gawd damn true, especialy because i could have told ya  that its a meaningless difference but then again this is why im hanging with what TechDeals said that ppl cling too much onto Benchmarks vs Realworld Experience which is kinda lame now specialy the corcount is ABYSMAL, 550+ USD for a friggin 8 core, i think i cant see straight \^\_\^ 8c is deffinelty the new Quadcore stagnation Era for sure   good thing i went 9950X3D back in August 2024 and just be done with it :)",Negative

AMD,"Plenty of reasons to not have the highest hopes for consumer PCs at the moment, but reddit and youtube somehow still manage to take it to a comical degree. Avid techtube watchers must be living in the end times right now",Negative
AMD,Do you disagree? DIY PC gaming as a hobby has been a mess for like 8 of the last 10 years.  Do you want them to say this is good?  Or to benchmark GPUs that came out a year ago? Or do custom build videos and just ignore that the RAM kit cost as much as the GPU?,Negative
AMD,"People are eating it up. It’s rage bait. Just look at the comments on GeForce Now threads, which actually launched 10 years ago. People are mad about a decade old service they don’t even use.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah it was pretty rare, you were just way better off getting a 1700X or later the 1700 for way less money and like 95-98% of the same performance. The only area where the 1800X shined was clock speed and even then it basically capped at like 4.0-4.1 GHz on golden samples. You were just better off buying a 1700X and OC'ing it to 1800X clock speed and pocketing the difference or spending it on more RAM or something else.  Notice how AMD basically doesn't allow for a slower speed variant with the same cores anymore on the high end like they used to? If you want a 9950X or 9950X3D you have to buy it. Only lower end SKUs like the 9600X will ever see a 9600 or 9500X with similar specs other than clock speeds. AMD might do a refresh of say the 5950X and make a '5950XT' but that's basically just a new stepping and it releases pretty much late into the lifecycle where it makes no sense to wait for it. You may as well wait another 3-6 months for the next generation stuff as your money goes further and it's a more substantial performance upgrade or has new platform features like PCI-E upgrades, DDR5/DDR6 etc.",Neutral
AMD,No it wasn't that rare it was just more expensive,Negative
AMD,"The 10850k was actually the reverse of this, it came after the 10900k. The 10900k was so aggressively binned the yields were terrible",Negative
AMD,"They are at least consistent on this topic, having also reacted the same to AMD XT refresh CPUs that this is based on",Neutral
AMD,I really hope more people start waking up to HUB’s bias. Techyescity called them out for questionable benchmarking not long ago and it’s always HUB with these crazy fine wine videos that nobody else can replicate.,Negative
AMD,Where did you see this? I'd love to learn more about it.,Positive
AMD,"Arrow Lake refresh? I think Intel said it's not a competitor to the x3d, meaning the 9850x3d is a CPU you don't need.",Neutral
AMD,">It’s simply silicon binning, where higher quality dies are allocated to higher-tier SKUs, a concept HUB seemingly isn’t familiar with.   What are you talking about?  They called this AMD's version of the KS weeks ago.  Looks like they were right.",Neutral
AMD,HUB isn’t familiar as they are deathly afraid of overclocking.,Negative
AMD,Performance and density go hand in hand ...,Neutral
AMD,Exactly why should AMD get a free pass just because their AMD if any we should be harder on AMD than on Intel. They are absolutely milking us for higher performance we should much better pricing. Those should go in tandem not one or the other. Its not like AMD has very little time between generations if Apple can release a good chip every year. I dont see why AMD cannot give comparable performance uplift at decent prices.,Negative
AMD,You forgot the VRAM increase on the 4070 Ti Super as well. That's a huge boon for a performance tier like that in terms of longevity and also just overall performance.,Positive
AMD,Some people also love gaslighting the audience.,Negative
AMD,"Glad to see more people calling it out. It seems like doomposting and ""let's see how we can spin this into something negative that make people feel like victims"" is the norm these days and it sucks.",Negative
AMD,Its milking there is no question about it. If Apple can release CPUs every year with meaningful improvements I dont see why AMD can't.,Neutral
AMD,Changing the socket got me so upset. I bought in because of AMD’s history of long term support.,Negative
AMD,I agree but no need for 80% of content to be the same doom and gloom thing over and over. It’s rage bait and clearly working for them.,Negative

AMD,"I still watch hub, but I have accepted that they test hw like it was an prebuild system from hp, dell, and so on.   When I started building it was just to build a pc cheaper than an prebuilt, then the more I dug into the hobby then I discovered that one can tune the hw, u dont need to oc it to the brink of destruction but having a system that run optimally for your workload was a given.  I am surprised how hubs and gns crowd/audience defend running systems which are not optimally setup. It is like they dont build their own systems but buy systems built by the stores.  so many issues, with these hw techoutlets, like skewed results, obviously faulty settings in the bios, 5.1ghz 14900k in gaming? gear 2 ddr4 vs ddr5?

AMD,Density does improve performance all else being equal but its not the only contributor.,Neutral
AMD,Kinda   Some performance improvements are from efficiency gains from design   Some performance gains come from density   You can cheat density to some regard by just making it bigger but that adds cost and lowers yields,Neutral
AMD,"It's because they know your only real choice is between Intel and AMD, the two pillars of the x86 duopoly.   If you choose something else you may lose compatibility with your x86 software, which many people aren't willing to do.",Neutral
AMD,"> if any we should be harder on AMD than on Intel     Objectively yes, kinda.

AMD,Duh. Tick tock was all about either getting your performance gains from using the same design at a new node or gains from a new architecture.,Neutral
AMD,Well compatibility layers exist and Microsoft is working hard on making WoA a first class solution. This X86 nonsense has to stop then only we will get progress in other architectures which would benefit consumers greatly of more companies can contribute.,Positive
AMD,Then X86 is the issue. I dont see why ARM could potentially be cheaper and yet better than X86. Then these companies would be irrelevant to the needed scrutiny.,Negative
AMD,"I had a few low end mobos, and all of them were way overbuilt compared to oem/branded prebuilts. But in many countries butique prebuilts is the most common.

AMD,Not when there's no easy way to install an alternate os on an ARM device like with x86.,Neutral

AMD,"die area is not the only cost indicator. B580 actually uses N5 fab, which is likely cheaper than N4, used by 5050. In reality, B580 only has about ~15% more transistors and if we assume N5 is cheaper per transistor and N5 has higher yields (by being more mature) i'd say their die cost might be very similar.  While yes, it has wider memory, the chips are clocked lower, so they can buy slower bins, reducing per chip cost.   B580 has more power draw, which in turn costs more for power delivery and cooling.  All in all, AIB manufacturer likely has lower margin per card as it stands, so i wouldn't be surprised if intel is taking a lower margin on the gpu/gddr combo to get more market share.  Nvidia on the other hand optimized their cost REALLY well, as they have been doing GPUs for almost 30 years.",Neutral
AMD,"Nvidia is getting such good performance out of such a small die because they're the best. Simple as. They've been doing GPU's for decades. It's not unexpected that at this stage Intel needs to use a larger die to match the performance - it would be incredibly surprising if that wasn't the case.  But a small *part* of that die size advantage comes from that narrow 128bit bus, and *part* of B580's appeal is its wider bus and subsequently more VRAM.",Positive

Personally i think the harm they do to the space/peoples mentality is farm more than the amount of good most (key word most, fire risks and stuff deserve prompt drama) of their coverage does.   Even this title takes a topic and very educational opportunity to provide actual hardware coverage and immediatly try’s to stoke negative furry about some aspect of the hardware industry. Its just non stop with them. I dont think its healthy for anyone to watch then honestly, which is sad as i used to enjoy their review/news. I hope for their sake they are not actually so perpetually angry and they are doing what they do to knowingly manipulate their audience for increased views/engagement. I cant imagine living life so constantly angry at every possible point over computer hardware, as much as i am saddened by the current state hardware and love gaming.   As tough as it is with rising prices and such and sad to think of what we could have instead, modern hardware, gaming, and such is in a nearly historic good state (realistic cost to perf is probably lowest in history other than brief periods such as the 30 series launch), and is a very cost effective hobby compared with other ones for the time you get out of it. Many great games launch all the time (even if big name traditional games have largely went to trash). They are easier to run with hardware (like the ARC gpu) being quite cheap and capable. People, like GN, need to temper their overexagerated frustration with a dose of real world perspective and objectivity.",Negative

AMD,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310. Almost anything these days is better than an A310.  >  Like the GT710 make no sense nowadays (their last attempt was what, the GeForce GTX 1630?), even though they sold like hotcakes for offices and for people who just wanted HDMI outs.  GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered. GTX 1630 was okay but it was supposed to be $149 USD MSRP and it came out for like $200 USD in most stores due to GPU shortage at the time, not much NVIDIA could really do about that.",Neutral

Apple only does top chips for each formfactor/TDP, 8W on the A18/A19, 20W for the M5, 45W for the M5 Pro, 65W for the M5 Max  The M5 of the X2 lineup is the base X2E. The X2P and X2E 12 core occupy the same TDP range but one is much faster than the other. It's a choice because they need to sell their chips to OEMs and consumers, Apple only needs to sell laptops.  Basically QC X2E die is 20-30mm\^2 bigger than the M5 die, for the fatter CPU, but the GPU is the same performance. Compared to the M5 Pro, the CPU performance is equivilant, but the GPU performance is 30% lower. QC has to make bets on what Consumers and OEMs want and IMO they made the smart bets.  The X2P has a very weak GPU, but CPU wise the 10 core version is close to M5 level. Die size wise most likely it's 120mm\^2 making it cheaper to manufacture and so, sell it for cheaper.",Neutral

AMD,"> Apple only does flagship chips  I find this opinion/position kind of hard to defend when the M4 Pro and M4 Max are both different, larger dies,  and absolutely sold as the premium, for-real-work upgrade. Apple does not market segment/differentiate based on TDP. You either need more power or you don't... and the M5 Max very much is just 3 M4's stuck together.  Even the price comparison doesn't really make sense--you can absolutely buy a brand-new, full price M4 laptop for ~$999 directly from Apple. That's not a sale price, that's not new-old-stock, 'oops nobody actually wanted to pay what we were overcharging' price, that's the same price it's been since it released. That won't even get you the lowest end, most-cut-down Strix Halo SOC inside a laptop.  Qualcomm can claim it's cheaper, but unless OEM's are overcharging to the tune of hundreds of dollars, I think the only vendor in question making $ here is Qualcomm.",Neutral
AMD,"I see that but the M4 doesn’t seem like it solves that- it’s just an old flagship chip. And I’m not sure I totally agree, the lower end iPads have a low bin M5 with a core disabled. Cutting edge node is usually A chips. So it’s a binned, “older” (for Apple) node and the lowest variant of the 4 (or 6, depending on how you count) versions of their lineup.  The M5 is in the iPad, seems like comparing to a current chip would be the thing to do given you’re never going to have a perfect comparison- I’d think people are more likely to compare that when shopping rather than say a used iPad on eBay.  Not a great comparison either but I’d be OK comparing say the 5090 to the M5 Ultra whenever that is released even though it is not apples to apples. . .",Negative

AMD,"Also, regarding multi-core performance: Geekbench 6 has no real reference value. If you want a benchmark, you should look at Cinebench R24 or R26. According to the information, the Qualcomm X2 Plus scores 1000 points at 45W in Cinebench R24, while the X2 Elite scores 1950 points at 100W. PLT hasn’t been unlocked yet, but based on some leaks, we can roughly estimate that the 388H’s multi-core score would be around 1170 at 45W and 1305 at 80W. So in terms of specs and efficiency, it’s basically comparable to Qualcomm.",Neutral
AMD,"Although they all brag about the core count, from the perspective of resource allocation, Intel’s E-cores and P-cores really can’t be mentioned in the same breath.   The die area of a single Intel P-core (including its cache) is roughly equivalent to **2.5–3 E-cores**. You can see this clearly just by looking at the die shot.  So Intel’s so-called “484” design (for example) is actually pretty close in real silicon scale to a pure **8 P-core** design.",Neutral

AMD,"But no actual numbers against PTL, right? They showed some graphs against LNL and the ancient HX 370 at launch at that's it.  PTL is loosely the successor of LNL. Intel doesn't have a current gen competitor to SDX2EE right now though ARL HX can be considered from the previous generation.  AMD HX 370 is a heavily nerfed Zen 5 chip, bringing little to no improvement over Zen 4 at per core level.

AMD,"Limited to the same TDP, X2E is still up to 2x on normal Panther Lake TDPs (X7/X9 is 60W TDP), but this is due to the much higher Perf/W QC and Apple have on their uarches.  The die size though you are correct, but if you count all tiles, the difference is simply that Intel allocated the die size to a much fatter GPU instead of CPU where they know they are behind. By going the GPU route, they secure very positive reviews because it carves a niche for them in the market where they are undisputed best.  Intel and AMD simply have lower perf/W. Panther Lake might fix it a bit, but e.g Lunar Lake on N3B was between 1.5-1.7x worse in perf/W vs 4nm X1 in ST",Neutral
AMD,"Their numbers are most likely from a ~130W reference platform (despite their ""laptop"" claims), while real retail devices will be running at 50 to 80W. It was the same with X1 benchmarks by QC - those results were NOT achieved by any real shipping device. If you take Mac Studio with M4 Max as a reference, which has similar TDP to their reference platform, X2 Elite Extreme is behind in both Cinebench 2024 as well as Geekbench 6.",Neutral
AMD,"Is the argument that Qualcomm's iGPU is weak compared to competition? Sure, no one will argue against that. My argument was that they are not hiding it, they have published the numbers and demoed the games - unlike Intel trying to keep their CPU performance under wrap till they can generate a mountain worth of goodwill among gamers with their iGPU perf.   Also, how will they compare it with Panther Lake when both the chips are launching together? Intel also only used the first gen X Elite in their PTL comparison.",Neutral

AMD,"My guess, based on what AMD has said about RDNA4 and UDNA, is that they didn't put the R&D into cutting RDNA4 down any smaller for iGPU usage. So far RDNA4 only has 2 die configs, 64 and 32cu. The 32cu config is exactly just 1/2 of the symmetrical 64cu config. And if you look at the die diagrams, it would take significant redesign to cut the size down further, far enough to fit into the space of 8-12cu RDNA3.5 spaces.  My guess is that UDNA is being designed for all sorts of configs, but has caused problem after problem for them... Just like every new GPU uArch family does for them. TeraScale, GCN, RDNA1. Each first iteration was a mess. I'm betting they wanted to get UDNA into iGPUs a lot sooner, and launch dGPU UDNA afterward. A guess.  NV hasn't been immune to this in the past. The FX Series, Tesla, and Fermi were all either under-performers, or problematic in their first iteration.   And weirdly Blackwell had a lot of initial driver issues.

Things that usually only amount to a small boost and often only in some situations/setups.  General driver support, optimizations, bug fixes and feature support has not been dropped.

There’s a version of that which Windows supplies, but we’ll be supplying a native version that is the same codebase as we use for our other products. We’ll also be introducing native OpenCL 3.0 support, also as used by our other products. And then in the first quarter of 2026 we’d like to introduce SYCL support, and SYCL is a higher-end compute-focused API and shading language for a GPU. It’s an open standard, other companies support it, and it helps us attack some of the GPGPU use-cases that exist on Windows for Snapdragon.""  https://chipsandcheese.com/p/diving-into-qualcomms-upcoming-adreno  > I'll probably get one of the 1st gen devices when those go on sale to clear the last remaining stock and see how things develop with 2nd and 3rd gen chips.

AMD,"a year would actually be quite long, Zen 5 launched July 2024. A successor two years later at least for the H2 mobiles would be nice. October/November 2026 desktop release would be reasonable and fit previous cadence, tho there are rumours about a N2X delay.  I think the biggest issue is the lack of a dGPU refresh and the non-existend RDNA4 iGPUs. RDNA5 is likely H2 2027, so sticking with RDNA 3.5 hurts. Most APUs/mobiles will only run a more modern gen starting in mid 2028, if they can even ramp enough beside some Halo SKUs, dGPU and consoles (not even counting AI-GPUs). with the current lack of FSR4 for RDNA 3.5, that's dissappointing, tho they think about backporting.  dual stacked V-cache (each CCD with 2 V-cache layers) and better memory controller/IOD would've been awesome as well.   rumours and leaks obviously had nothing on the radar, so it's not suprising nothing came from CES, but still, Lisa booked a keynote - and brought basically nothing. at last years CES they delayed RDNA4 - so it's the second disappointing keynote in a row.",Neutral

They also showed off a bunch of cool concepts like the computer-in-a-keyboard from HP, the rollable laptop from Lenovo, the dual-screen laptop from Asus. * A lot of monitor news. * A lot of PC case related stuff were shown. * IKEA has launched a bunch of matter devices for home automation as well as a 10 dollar speakers that can pair with up to 100 units. * Motorola showed off their Razr Fold phone. * Nvidia's DLSS 4.5 update seems pretty big and will work on older generations as well. * LG and Samsung both showed off new TVs. The latter showed off micro RGB. * A lot of audio-related stuff like new soundbars, wireless speakers from Samsung, Onkyo and so on. * Razer announced some gaming related stuff if that's what you care about. A new stream deck keyboard, a new controller and so on. Hyperkin also announced a modular clamp-on controller. * A robot vacuum that can climb stairs. * A bunch of car related things were announced as well, such as Ford saying L3 driving will come in 2028. * L'Oreal showed off a flat iron that uses IR light. * Asus showed off a Wi-Fi 8 router. * Lego showed off ""smart bricks"" which seems neat.  I could keep going but I think you get the point. There is a ton of stuff from CES that are consumer related.

The software support isn't their and AMD is trying to force people into their overpriced enterprise gear instead of supporting their GPUs.  Unless you've dealt with trying to implement your own local LLM stuff, none of this matters. Microsoft is just paying OEMs to brand shit as Ai, as if people need, or want it. Let alone have any idea what they'd use an NPU for.   I do think NPUs are great if you want to keep your data local. But the amount of work and effort is high, furthermore these NPUs are weak.

Strix Point uses RDNA “3.5” which is shockingly poor in terms of gains from the RDNA 3 iGPU’s which launched in 2023.   Just for context, Intel’s Lunar Lake iGPU’s were Xe2 and [were beating Strix Point last year.](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Lunar-Lake-iGPU-analysis-Arc-Graphics-140V-is-faster-and-more-efficient-than-Radeon-890M.894167.0.html)  I get it sounds “controversial” to some people in here, who see the success of AMD in handhelds and such, but again, most of those handhelds were made back when these RDNA 3 based iGPU’s launched. The Z1 was RDNA 3 and is used in most handhelds because, at the time in 2023, it was the best option available.  They’ve sat twiddling their thumbs after securing one win in 2023 that everyone else has caught up or surpassed them in mobile GPU efficiency and performance per watt.  Strix Halo has the same issue, the only difference they’ve done is increased memory bandwidth and increased the power. So in terms of perf/watt it’s still bad despite the fact that it is a good performing GPU.   “RDNA 3.5” is nonsense. AMD seemingly can’t seem to make a better iGPU with any measurable performance/watt improvements than what they did in 2023.  They’ve improved their CPU performance, with Zen 5 based processors, but again just disappointing iGPU improvements.",Negative
AMD,"> the actual suspicious part is the fact that they were only letting people test the GPU with games, not the CPU  Not suspicious, it's simply that the CPU is nothing special, no more than a node sidegrade and a very minor IPC bump.

Even enthusiasts may choose to skip 2 generations instead of maybe upgrade every other gen - so we are looking at maybe 5 years of usage for a single card.

(3 GB on both sides)  and again to be clear to not have the 8 GB vram issue all over again you need 24 GB if the ps6 comes with 30 GB or 32 GB if it comes with 40 GB.  nvidia and amd know this.  they just hate you and want to sell you hardware, that will become broken in 2-3 years already.  the fact, that you call this ""quite good"" is just ignoring reality and terrible.  can  you please start calling out scum companies shitting on us?",Neutral

But there are plenty of people who don't give a shit about that sort of thing, and just want a raw power house to pump out frames.

Even if they're not nearly as competitive as I wish they were, AMD does keep Nvidia in check at least somewhat lol.

AMD,"It's weird that there was no Super series for the 30 series. They released the 3080 12gb and 10gb, so the 12gb could have been called the 3080 SUPER. Laptops got a 320 bit GA103 die that never made it into any product in the full configuration and was always cut down in really weird ways. Always 256 bit.  Even cut down as far as to put into some rare 3060ti cards. They could have easily been the 10GB RTX 3070ti SUPER. It's like it's a die they made, and then regretted it, and tried to make it disappear. Even the 3060 had room for more enabled SMs. It really feels like they just cancelled that while series as well because the crypto and COVID boom was already enough, so no need to put in more effort.",Negative
AMD,"nvidias super series is just a refresh. There are a couple reasons to do refreshes for a manufacturer:   1. You typically get better chips over time. At the beginning you typically don't exactly how yields and binning will be, after some time you can typically sell higher binned products because you know how it'll work out. Even if it's a few percent, it's a small improvement for hardly any cost. Especially when the next generation is far in the future.  2. Price drops. The vast majority of cost appears in development, not per unit cost. After selling enough units and your rnd is paid for you're pretty much only making profits and can easily drop prices. It's typically better to introduce a new, cheaper product than just lowering prices in the market.      The RTX 5090 likely wouldn't get a refresh, why? It would only threaten their compute cards.    The RTX 5080 is already using the full GB203 die.    The 5070ti is already super close to the 5080.    The 5060ti is already using the full die.   A refresh would only make sense for the 5070ti (essentially sell the current 5080 as a 5070ti super), 5070 and 5060 unless they want the same performance with more vram.    We don't know how far away the next generation is.    Blackwell was never a good candidate for a refresh, never really made much sense.",Neutral

It's.....not great. lol  I think it'll get a bit easier going forward, cuz the next consoles are inevitably going to be very disappointing, at least if they release within the next couple years and dont cost $1000.  There wont be any huge uplift in performance this time around because of the need to hit a price point that wont make people scream.  PS5 Pro already shows how little they're able to improve over time compared to what the PS4 Pro offered in a similar time frame(and without a huge increase in price...).  And not only will the PS6 specs not be that amazing, but we're bound to have another like three years of cross-gen titles as well.  So even people with something well less than a 5080 will likely still be capable of playing the latest games decently enough for a good while.  I think a 5080 will probably be very in line with what PS6 offers in general, really.  Bit sad, honestly.  Sure, it's fine for getting more longevity out of your existing PC, but this is all because prices and especially performance per dollar improvements are becoming so bad.

So thats how we ended up with a 12gb 3060 and an 8gb 3060ti which was almost a 3070 but back then you couldn't find either for sale at less than 3x MSRP. You had to wait for an ETH crash, the first of which occurred in August 2021.   I still remember keeping a damn xlsx spreadsheet tracking ETH price weekly.

I think Nvidia didn't consider the SUPER line any more than a one-off at the time, which is why they didn't go back to it for 30 series(which also offered pretty reasonable value out the box anyways).

You can just tell looking at how they specifically cut down their parts and what gaps there were.  And it's not like 5nm was some totally new node either, it had been in products since 2020 already and by all accounts had great yields and mature characteristics.

My overall point was the VRAM argument is always overblown in my opinion.  I disagree. I played MGSV recently, it is not nostalgia. I offered other examples as well. I do not agree with you on the quality of upscaled images with DLSS. Does Stalker 2 look better than MGSV? I suppose in some ways yes, but then as you play it, it’s as if something got stuck in your eye. The image isn’t stable, you shut off a flashlight and wait a moment for Lumen to catch up and make all the light particles disappear rather than it be an instant lights off. Same thing as in MGS Delta, a better apples to apples comparison, it looks good in a still image but when you move around and look at the foliage or off in the distance you see the specs flashing about and the blur/ai fighting with itself. These things are all noticeable and there are communities of people coming about because it’s almost a complete disappointment to find out a game you are interested in is releasing on UE5.  I think my point stands, MGSV looked better native, compare its native image to MGS delta on a native setting.

Important to note, **these tests are done at \~60W package power.** I would've loved to see a smaller power envelope, but we'll just have to wait. In three games, CP2077, Doom TDA, and SotR. Similarly power configured HX 370 and Strix Halo, Panther Lake (B390 12 Xe3 cores), is **2x faster** than the former and \~**23% slower than the latter** (Strix Halo being on avg, 30% faster). AMD announced Ryzen AI MAX+ 392 and MAX+ 388 with smaller CPU configs but with the full GPU, so it'd be interesting where that takes them, as far as I know the Asus TUF Gaming A14 has the 392, and I could probably count on one hand how many laptops/tablets has Strix Halo lmao.  Very respectable showing. Though, I really wished Intel had updated their ML upscaler since there only have been incremental updates with XeSS 2, and so far is only on par with DLSS CNN, where FSR4 (and INT8) and DLSS4/.5 are superior. Don't get me wrong, XeSS3 and it's ML M/FG is great and I reckon has no frame pacing/jitter issues compared to Redstone FG, but this was a small miss from them.

Halo has an absolutely massive GPU die and barely performs better at this wattage while PTL is around the same size as Strix, and such a difference in die size affects product costs and company margins.Halo is only in a few products, and that list shrinks significantly when you're looking for a thin small laptop or handheld. Since most people will use upscaling, Xess2>FSR3 (FSR4 not supported), so image quality and stabilization will be worse on Halo. Don't get me wrong Halo is still good and still shines in its own way, but it doesn't actually win against PTL imo unless you only look at FPS and ignore every other factor.  As for the 3050 and 6600 (desktop) comparisons. Lets just say it's +-10% depending on the game and settings. With such close performance it essentially shows that lower end mobile dGPUs are about to become a relic. You end up using like twice the power, and pay more money for essentially the same performance as a PTL iGPU  TLDR; Panther Lake looks like it'll be the best laptop chip to buy, at least in gaming, and seems like Intel is back to making good products.",Negative

AMD,"Impressive, I wonder what the different in memory bandwidth to the GPU is here given that Strix Halo is 4 channels to Panther Lake's 2 (even if the per channel throughput is higher).  That said, there's a process advantage going from TSMC 4 (which is a TSMC 5 derivative) to TSMC 3e, to temper the conversation a tad.",Positive
AMD,"1080 ultra RT @ 20fps may be 2x faster than strix point but is still unplaybale, apart for making intel look better than it really is no one would use these settings.  intel showing cherry picked benchmarks is usual but DF doing it for them is questionnable.",Negative
AMD,It still has to compete with a notebook with an Nvidia 5050 or 5060 GPU.,Neutral

AMD,"Doubt it will beat Raptor Lake refresh in single thread, though a lot of Core 200 is not Raptor Lake, but Alder Lake since it‘s a refresh of the U and H series CPUs of 13th gen, which were basically rebadged 12th gen CPUs with the Raptor Lake labeling..",Neutral
AMD,"It's going to be a side-grade to LNL in single thread at iso-power, plus maybe a couple of percent on the architecture tweak.  A higher power envelope will make it outperform, and more cores will make it outperform in multi-core testing (including at iso-power, since more cores at lower power each beats fewer cores at higher power each).  For the 'big increase' in 1T will have to look to NVL which is going to have a big node jump to N2 and a big architecture change, and NVL will also have (overkill) core counts.",Neutral

Even without, Intel has made good efficiency improvements for PTL compared to LNL.  PTL is their new baseline for future performance, on all fronts it's better than what they made in the past.",Positive
AMD,What power level for the GPU in the dgpu tests?,Neutral
AMD,Yep. Would like to see some benchmarks without RT since I suspect that's causing a big part of the difference. RT will likely be practically unusable on the 388H soon even with Xess.,Negative

AMD,>AMD showing signs of complacency lately  It's not even a recent occurrence. That's just Radeon being Radeon tbh.,Negative
AMD,"It has been going on with CPU for 3 years now too. AMD started ignoring consumers as soon as Intel was no longer a threat, and focused on datacenter. Core counts, prices, performance all stagnated.",Negative
AMD,Crushing CPU isn't enough?,Neutral
AMD,"The reviewers did note fairly that the wattage is a notable part of it - Strix Point isn't really designed to be run at 65W, and Strix Halo isn't really a 65W part either - Strix Point is being run above its positioned power envelope, and Halo below.  Halo has quite a bit of performance left up the wattage curve.  The native performance was surprisingly pretty strong, but it's with the modern XeSS solution that you really see it shine - it's much better than FSR3 on the AMD mobile offerings in terms of quality and performance.  Think this part will overall be the one to beat.  Strix Point is dated, and Halo is too expensive and rare and power hungry.  Think INTC knocked it out of the park, and there is still room to iterate on the model.",Positive
AMD,8060s in Strix Halo is about 6 times bigger than Xe3 in Panther Lake.,Neutral
AMD,"Lower end mobile gpus are not dead lol.  The rtx 5050 laptop is faster than the desktop 5050 assuming it’s the full 100w+ version obviously.  The 4060 laptop from 3 years ago was still 13% faster than strix halo at its actual full 100-120w at 1440p in 20+ game average. The lowest end 5050 laptop is on par with the 4060 laptop.  This panther lake b390 iGPU is about 3050 laptop/desktop performance, which was already a crappy gpu when it launched more than half a decade ago, as it was barely faster than the 1660ti. Thats not even considering the massive leaps and bounds dlss upscaling has over the other two (fsr 3, xess)",Neutral
AMD,"You're completely ignoring the fact that all of these benchmarks are still hand picked RT benchmarks, and are extrapolating the data to mean that Intel is better across the board in performance and efficiency. Yes AMD still sucks at RT.... That shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. It's exciting that Intel has leapfrogged in RT, but I wouldn't extrapolate in this way. We still don't know performance of non-rt, which is almost certainly a different story because otherwise it would be included. Because the frame rates are still ballsack low, these wins are still meaningless and not useful in any real world usecases. Congrats, you leapfrogged performance in an area nobody cares about.",Negative
AMD,From what I’ve heard it’s a pretty expensive package. You probably will only see it in the 1000+ dollar ones from rog and Lenovo.   Maybe in a few years if the price drops enough,Neutral
AMD,Steam Deck 2 will be an ARM device more than likely.,Neutral

AMD,Yes. There is a Core Ultra 5 variant with 10 GPU cores compared to this one's 12 GPU cores. Probably matching RTX 3050 Ti mobile in performance.,Neutral
AMD,They explicitly say that you wouldn't play at those settings without upscaling. The main point is demonstrating performance delta in a GPU limited scenario,Neutral

AMD,1. Its very expensive 2. bandwidth limited 3. it really should've been RDNA4  \[This got fixed\] 4. it was always paired with 16 cpu cores which simply bloated the power profile but it finally got fixed with 388.     Still missing the first 3 issues.,Negative
AMD,"Kind of. AMD didn't think it would take off, and even a lot of gamers at first thought it was a joke. Nvidia pushed hard, and implemented tech like upscaling, and frame generation to make it more, and more viable. They steered the industry in this direction, and AMD kept heading straight. Intel followed the captain of the ship instead. Nvidia. AMD is course  correcting, but won't be totally on track until likely RDNA5.",Neutral

AMD,I used fsr4 using optiscaler on my lego2 and it tanked fps by like 20%+. Is that what you mean,Negative
AMD,"Not really. We need to consider Intel can use XMX version of XeSS and it's much better than DP4A version. Tom defended their decision to call all XeSS the same. I still disagree. To this day people need to add ""and we're talking about X version"" where X is either superior Intel native XMX or general purpose DP4A. Plus INT8 version of FSR4 has slightly worse IQ compared to FP8 and has a massive perf hit compared to FSR3 on RDNA3.

AMD,"Halo is the most cost effective way to have 128GB of VRAM for AI workloads. Sure, there are faster options but they're way more expensive, and not all AI work must be real time.

AMD,Well Adam is too scared to say exactly what was needed to be said. If he had challenged him and said that the int8 version of FSR4 does work well on RDNA3 and that Nvidia has released a slower FP16 version of DLSS4.5 then the AMD guy would not have had the chance to deviate from the question.

Using the values from the HUB video today, I can see that the difference in frametime cost between Preset K and M on a 3090 at 1440p totals around 2.2ms - depending on the title but in that region. That's literally the cost of running the _entire_ FP8 model of FSR4 on my 7800XT at 1440p.   And I'm just comparing the _difference_ between Preset K and M. The cost of preset M itself is probably close to double the frametime cost _of the entire FP8 FSR4 model_ running on my 7800XT.  For reference, the INT8 model of FSR4 sits around 1.7ms.",Negative

AMD,"The question isn't if it's better looking than a FSR3, but if it's better than native resolution in terms of FPS,  and image quality. If it's only 10% faster native, but looks 10% worse, was it really worth it? At the end of the day is always ""How many more FPS does this upscaling et me?"" I feel everyone has forgotten what the point of upscaling actually was. It's not to look better than older tech. It's to get you more FPS.  The amount of people with an RX 7600 to 7800xt, far outnumber the people with an RX 7900xtx multiple times. They'll be launching software that worse, or has no benefit for like 70% of the user base trying it. Similar boat Nvidia is in with the RTX 2000 series being able to run DLSS4.5. It runs like crap. It only exists to upsell users to newer GPUs, and try out the tech. I believe at one point Nvidia made ray tracing possible to enable on the GTX 1660 cards. Maybe it still is. Even though it runs at like 10 FPS. They software updated DXR support. Just for the users to feel like they are missing out, and get them to run to the store.  On top of that, the INT8 version apparently looks worse. Intel regrets launching a better and worse version of XeSS. The open DP4a version ruined the reputation of XeSS for Intel.

That's just lunacy.",Negative
AMD,"Yes, it doesn't. WMMA are just instructions. It's not dedicated hardware like Nvidia's tensor cores, it just runs on CUs and competes against graphics rendering for resources.  Also notice the page you liked for WMMA on RDNA 3 specifically shows it lacks support for FP8, which is what FSR 4 relies on.  If you want to get pedantic RDNA 4 is technically not full dedicated hardware like tensor cores either, but unlike WMMA in RDNA 3, in RDNA 4 matrix multiplication acceleration does have dedicated pipelines inside the CUs, so it doesn't compete with graphics for resources (as much), and supports FP8 that FSR 4 uses.  As for the second link, yes, you can force FRS 4 on RDNA 3 and older (using either the leaked INT8 version, of the WMMA fallback which is also INT8), but the performance cost is so high it's barely worth using over native. You could argue it would be good to have the option still, and AMD is working on it, but obviously they are not happy with the state INT8 FSR 4 is in yet, and I can see why.",Neutral

AMD,"I think there are two reasons for it:  1. Frame Gen is not as widely used or desirable as upscaling. So people don't actually care too much that Nvidia locks it to 40+ series.  2. RTX 2000 is 3 generations ago. It's fine if it isn't running DLSS 4.5 well - you can still use the pretty good DLSS CNN model with decent performance. In contrast AMD is not support the immediately preceding generation when even something like the [7800XT will fly with the Int8 version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPMOjdvmHMk). Not even immediately preceding, they are still launching new products with RDNA 3.5 just now! It doesn't help that FSR3.x is just really bad compared to any ML-based upscaler.",Negative

AMD,"No offense, but that's complete nonsense. It's the same model powering both versions, just being run utilizing a different data format, likely there's just a type conversion taking place similar to how the FP8 version of FSR4 runs on RDNA3 on Linux. Upcasting to a higher precision data format does not take a significant amount of compute to do, it's extremely simple to do at runtime (which is very evident by the fact that the simple FSR4 INT8 model only sits about 25% faster than the more computationally expensive FSR4 model on RDNA3).",Neutral

AMD,"> RTX 2000 is 3 generations ago. It's fine if it isn't running DLSS 4.5 well - you can still use the pretty good DLSS CNN model with decent performance. In contrast AMD is not support the immediately preceding generation  Just like Nvidia didn't support the immediately preceding generation (GTX 1000) and even the **current** generation (GTX 1600) cards when it launched DLSS. That will always happen when you go from no hardware acceleration in one gen to having hardware acceleration in the next. There will always be that point where someone is getting ""screwed"", for Nvidia it was Pascal/Turing, for AMD it's RDNA 3/RDNA 4.  AMD is at least attempting to make an INT8 fallback. Nvidia didn't even do that, just said ""sucks to be you"" to Pascal and low-end Turing owners.  >the 7800XT will fly with the Int8 version  lol  Being extremely generous by describing this as ""fly"". The video shows FSR 4 quality on the 7800 XT is a whopping 6% faster than native. Plenty of testing done by Digital Foundry, Hardware Unboxed, Gamer Nexus as well shows it's often in the ~10% faster than native ballpark in higher-end cards (7800, 7900 models). At that point it's hardly worth using over native, and that's on high-end models. On mainstream cards like the 6600, 6700 and 7600 models, which is the majority of RDNA 2/3 cards sold, the overhead would be even larger.  So yeah, I understand people would like the option, but I can totally see why AMD doesn't want to release it in this state.  >Not even immediately preceding, they are still launching new products with RDNA 3.5 just now!  I agree that the way AMD refuses to update their IGPs to their current GPU arch is incredibly stupid, but those are mobile chips that have nothing whatsoever to do with the people here asking for the INT8 version for desktop cards.",Neutral
AMD,">it would just mean less of a performance hit  No. Accelerators means lower performance cost **and** higher visual quality. Both of those together is what makes the upscaling worth using.  Without accelerators, you get a hit to visual quality while only getting a tiny performance improvement over native, which is hardly worth using. That's exactly what INT8 FSR 4 is. No point in reducing quality to gain +10% FPS, better to just use native.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm recalling from memory an anandtech-style deep dive I watched on youtube around the time the 9070 launched. I'll look for it again, I'll update this comment with the link once I find it.  To be clear, RDNA 4 still does matrix multiplication in the CUs, but the structures/ALUs inside each CU that do that math are physically larger, with more transistors, more registers, better schedulers, more pipelines (as in more literal silicon paths between CU units), etc. Basically, a larger portion of the transistor budget per CU dedicated to them. In addition, of course, to the new instructions, like FP8.",Neutral
AMD,"No, its not the same model. They remade the same model to run int FP16. Same model could not run, as 20/30 series cannot do it hardware wise. You cannot just use a same model and use different weight types. it does not work like that.  It isnt just a type coversion. We know what a type conversion looks like, and it looks like horrible performance. The first try of this was when they tried to make DLSS2 work on 1080. Typer conversion clearly isnt a solution.  >Upcasting to a higher precision data format does not take a significant amount of compute to do  You are using the same compute you would use for lower precision data, but with higher precision. And that means you can do a lot less of it. But with upscalers you cannot do less of it, you still got to do the entire thing. This means it gets slow.

AMD,7800X3D with either 9070XT or 5070ti imo. 5080 is way too expensive for not enough performance increase,Negative
AMD,"Currently, the hardware sweetspot is 1440p gaming on a 27"" monitor.  Monitor should be OLED, which is highly recommended.  This would be my take:   \- storage: 2 TB M.2 SSD (do not take 1 TB cause it will not be enough for games, 2 TB is truly great. Also 2 x 1 TB is not really recommended either)  \- GPU: Radeon RX 9070 XT, which is the best bang for what it offers now.  \- 850W Gold or Platinum PSU, at least ATX 3.0 supported  Now, CPU is a great question. You could either go with:  \- Ryzen 7 7800x3d  \- 2x16GB (32 GB) DDR5 6000 MHz Cl30 ram (note that e.g. a CL38 latency often performs worse than DDR4)   Or:  \- Intel CPU, it the following strength order: 12600KF < 14500 < 12700KF < 14600KF < 14700KF  \- 2x16GB (32 GB) DDR4 3600 MHz Cl18 ram  Motherboard can be a lot nice to be found, also PC case as you wish.  Regarding CPU cooler just take any dual tower cheap cooler, a great idea would be Phantom Spirit 120.  Some notes to take:  \- I would really recommend to buy your stuff as soon as possible, GPU and SSD prices might be skyrocketing very soon after RAM prices  \- do NOT buy only 16 GB (DDR4-5) RAM, it is not enough  \- non X3D AMD CPU-s do not really worth it. In that case, just go for Intel, which also has DDR4 support for great budget saving.  \- follow this guy, he has great comments: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1psnsbg/comment/nvazhh3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)",Positive

A minimum, I think it's something that everyone who is budget restricted should give a shot; especially if you're more of a patient gamer. For me, a 5700XT to a 4070 Ti Super felt like a brand new computer that didn't really need anything else.   In my case, I never actually naturally encountered a title that my 3600 couldn't run that I really wanted to play. Sure I saw some in benchmarks showing that some titles experienced sub-70FPS, but seeing it is different than actually encountering it in my natural course of gaming. Plus.. it's pretty much the same as seeing a title on PS5 or Switch that interests me, but I'll probably never play because I don't have a PS5 or Switch.  Sure some titles would also perform better than my 3600 could when paired with a 4070 Ti Super, but for the most part 90FPS or higher feels fine to me and I only have a 144hz 1440p monitor that I can't really tell the difference at between 110FPS and 144FPS. DLSS feels perfect fine and really carries the 3600 pretty far.   In all honesty, Hell Let Loose was the only title that I ever really naturally encountered that made the 3600 feel a bit tired, but by all means it was playable.   I did eventually move on to first a 5600 and then a 7600x, but that was more of a no-brainer financial decision. I found super good prices on both when prices were good ($110 on the CPU/mobo/RAM side of things after selling my old mobo/RAM/CPU). In all honesty, I couldn't personally say I've naturally encountered any game-changing improvements with either the 5600 or 7600x. Again, there definitely are some out there. Especially BF6. But you can stretch a 3600 extremely far and get great results (until you run into something that you flat out can't that's under 60FPS).   I've since played a couple games that my 3600 probably would have struggled with, but in all honesty they were titles I thought were overrated and could have lived without and that was my experience playing them. Had I upgraded from a 3600 to 7600x with the current prices and knew better, I'd probably have pretty bad buyers remorse.",Neutral

AMD,"In that case I’d just replace the gpu. Save the money or consider moving it into a better gpu like the 9070xt for an even better gaming experience (more vram, higher frames etc.)  That’s a pretty high wattage psu in that pc, does it have a gpu in it already?",Positive
AMD,"Yeah but it’s not like you are investing more money into the lga1700 system, you already have it.  You also don’t gain anything by moving to am5 right now, if you wanted to switch later and get a newer x3d chip you would just shift the buying of the motherboard to then. You already have the ddr5 which is the hard part.  I’m not seeing the logic unless you really want the x3d right now. I don’t really see the value in replacing such a recent and high performing cpu.  At the very least you could try out the pc with the gpu and decide if you really need to upgrade the cpu. Does that computer have a gpu already? I’d be wary of spending lots of money for minor improvements.",Negative
AMD,"Not yet, planning to get rtx 5070 16gb this month.",Neutral
AMD,"Ok then yeah, I’d say go ahead and get a 5070 for that pc. The 5070 is 12gb so if you really want 16gb your best options are the 9070xt or 5070ti",Neutral
AMD,"Put the 680$ for the amd platform upgrade towards a higher tier gpu and keep the 14600k, don’t buy a 12gb card in 2026. Find a 5080 for msrp before it’s too late!",Neutral
AMD,"Do you think it worth it to go to 5080, or wait for a new GPU release",Neutral
AMD,5080 gives not much performance increase at a pretty big premium. Wouldn’t really recommend it’s not a very sensible choice imo.  Probably not a good idea to wait on the gpu.. if you want one get it now. Prices are going up and may not come down for a while. The 9070xt can be found for around 650 and the 5070ti for around 750.,Negative

AMD,"As long as you get a well known brand they are all very similar.  Some might be overclocked or better vrm, etc, but its usually within a few percent for performance.",Neutral
AMD,just get one that has dual BIOS that you like the look of.,Positive
AMD,The Sapphire Pulse is a really quiet card with excellent cooling.,Positive
AMD,"Shouldn't make much of a difference. While it is true that the cooling setup on some models isn't optimal, undervolting and ensuring proper case airflow mitigates slight design differences.",Negative
AMD,"XFX and Sapphire both have slightly better warranties than ASRock. Never dealt with ASRock warranty, but the other two have been awesome when I've had to deal with them.",Positive
AMD,"Brands do matter. Not necessarily for performance, but more for build quality, the fans being quieter and the everything lasting longer.  And better thermals which equals better performance.",Positive
AMD,"The more expensive models usually bring a few percent more power (or less heat) but cost up to 10-20% more.  I selected mine by it's size (gigabyte model has 3x 90mm fans instead of 3x100 , so the overall size is 289mm instead of the usual 310-340mm and thus fitting my smaller case.  Undervolted it, set a lower power target and increased the memory clock speed a bit and it mostly runs without fans (below 60°C) at 1440p 75Hz on ultra in BG3, Wreckfest2 or with high settings 4k 60hz (for wrc24 and automobilsta 2 in the rig)",Neutral

AMD,No. My XFX swift is top in benchmarks has great thermals.,Positive
AMD,"I'm being overly pedantic here. It's not really the ""brand"" that you should concern yourself with. ASRock is the brand. It has a variety of hardware tiers like most other brands.  That being said, you're budget shopping. So you're in a budget range. The question you have to ask is: what do you want out of your GPU?  I run AI image and video generation. So there are times when my GPU temps go wild. Which means that I need the right kind of hardware to tolerate temperature spikes consistently and long enough. This requires better architecture, cooling and materials to that end. So I got a ""higher end"" GPU.  If you're not stressing a PC and just regularly gaming, a Steel Legend, for example, is perfectly fine. It might be a little noisier. It might run slightly hotter. But you're going to get enough value for it to justify the purchase.",Neutral
AMD,"They marginally matter if your gaming, I'd just get what's cheapest, maybe pay a little more if it looks cool  If you are doing heavy workload on it, running at high power consistently, cooling can matter so get better coolers",Neutral
AMD,The main differences lie in stock power limits and cooling implementation. Do your research and figure out what you're willing to pay for.,Neutral
AMD,"I got the Asrock 9070xt Challenger for 580 usd at microcenter. Although I haven’t had it long enough to where I can say it’s for sure reliable, its performance is great and have no complaints about that.",Positive
AMD,"I have the Pulse and it's quiet albeit the VRAM temperature is a smidge in the ""it could be better"". Mine sits in an Antec Flux SE, with two inverted 120s in the bottom.  If your budget is tight you can get the ASRock, undervolt it or tinker with your fan profile and the case airflow helps a lot. If your case is less airflow-y maybe spend a little and get the Pulse",Neutral
AMD,"Performance wise, there's not much in it.   The only concern I had for mine was size, in particular length. These GPUs are chunky boys, and with a Fractal North case, and a radiator in the front, I don't have that much space. Ended up going for the Gigabyte model, as many other models would not have fit.",Negative
AMD,"The Sapphire Pulse is a great card and got the ""Excellent"" award by Dutch review outlet Tweakers in their 9070 XT round-up. The lack of BIOS switch is a downside, but it has great thermals and silent fans, and it's one of the cheapest cards on the market.  https://tweakers.net/reviews/13234/13x-radeon-rx-9070-xt-mega-round-up-de-slimste-koop-is-niet-de-duurste.html",Positive
AMD,Linux driver support varies a lot.,Neutral
AMD,Small difference.  The cost added doesnt match the performance increase.  Just get the cheapest one.,Negative
AMD,It depends. If you are just gaming it is fine. Otherwise just spend a bit more for the sapphire 9060xt.,Neutral
AMD,"It can make a difference for temperatures, noise, a little bit of performance. What can be most ""worth it"" is if a brand is known for having bad support/warranty service. In that case $45 could be easily worth it just to avoid that. Of course multiple manufacturers have been known to have issues recently so it can be tricky.",Negative
AMD,"Slightly better thermals, slightly better reliability, and slightly better OC capability for very marginal gains.  Unless you’ve a case with shitty airflow, run your card 24/7 or care about a net 0.2fps gain, it’s almost entirely down to cosmetics.  If you’re on a budget and just want performance, get the cheapest.",Neutral
AMD,Only if noise levels or overclocking matter to you. Stock performance is going to be really really similar across the board.,Neutral
AMD,"I have an ASrock challenger, it was $599.  No issues, takes a decent undervolt and overclock running 3200+ mhz sustained with no thermal throttling, VRAM didn't have much room to OC though.   My son has a prebuilt with the steel legend version in it...again no issues.   If you're not planning to overclock, it doesn't matter unless sound is your most important metric.  In which case the more robust cooling solution will typically be quieter.   When I'm gaming I have my headset on, and my pc is a few feet away so that's not really a concern for me.",Neutral
AMD,"The higher tier cards have higher margins. Why? Because they add on extra features that cost almost nothing and charge tons of money for them.  There is almost no reason to spend extra. None of the cards are binned, the performance difference between cards is 100% due to power targets and factory OC settings. The only thing measurable difference is going to be the temperature and noise. Temperature does not matter at all because all the cards can be configured to be at the same sound level, so the real difference is sound/noise levels.",Negative
AMD,"Just grab the Pulse tbh.  Unless you want the american muscle car equivalent aka the Mercury OC, loud n proud",Neutral
AMD,"Depends on what you care about.  Performance? Negligible difference.  Sound levels? The cooling solution does make a difference here. There are cards with better fans that run quieter.  Warranty/Customer Service? Some companies are a lot better than others. Both Sapphire and XFX are preferred because of their better customer service and warranty handling.  So you aren't going to get a card that gives you more FPS, but it might not make as much noise. Plus if you get unlucky and your card dies some companies will treat you better. For example Asus is infamous for their terrible warranty support to the point where it is probably illegal. They'll claim you have to pay to have your GPU repaired because there is a tiny scratch on the plastic.  For AMD GPUs Sapphire and XFX should be your first choices, specifically because they generally treat their customers well. With EVGA out of the Nvidia GPU space, Nvidia customers wish these companies made Nvidia cards.  Asus should always be your last choice, for every part they make, for how shitty their warranty service is. AS Rock in the GPU space is mid tier, they haven't had any major screw ups in the GPU space and they have alright warranty support. Which is funny because they are owned by Asus.",Neutral
AMD,Just be happy to je privileged and able to get one :) it really doesn‘t matter in most use cases,Positive
AMD,"True. I doubt that in a few months I'm going to be kicking myself thinking ""If only i'd spent $50 more I'd be getting 2% more performance right now!""   I'm mostly worried about poor build quality leading to overly loud fans or poor temperatures, but for casual gaming I doubt that my GPU will ever be put into situations where it matters all that much.",Negative
AMD,a gpu that has bios? dual ones? could you elaborate on that and why it matters,Neutral
AMD,"Just wanted to +1 the Sapphire Pulse cards, my 5700xt was so good I upgraded to the [7800xt](https://www.sapphiretech.com/en/consumer/pulse-radeon-rx-7800-xt-16g-gddr6). Really happy I picked up a 16Gb card given the current AI shitshow.",Positive
AMD,Mine is so quiet I thought there was something wrong with it,Negative
AMD,"That's part of what prompted the question. The Steel Legend looks to have a poorer build quality than some of the other cards, although that's to be expected with a lower priced model. That being said, the other cards at the same price point as the legend will probably be of similar build quality.",Neutral
AMD,"I wouldn’t put too much stock into steel nomad, lots of the people running that benchmark are running fine tuned overclocks which skews the data further to the right in terms of performance. I would instead run some benchmarks on games you are actually playing and compare those to ones online. And your gpu power will be affected by cpu and ram so take that into consideration as well.",Neutral
AMD,"Perhaps ""brand"" was the wrong term. I couldn't think of the perfect term. Maybe simply ""card"" would have been more appropriate. That being said thanks for the correction.  As you say, I'll probably be using the card mostly for casual gaming at the end of the day. The Steel Legend is probably more than enough for my situation. It's just that when I see it being ranked at the lower end of 9070xt benchmarks, it makes me pause for thought.",Neutral
AMD,"I've done some research and the Steel Legend often runs hotter than other models at this price point. It seemingly performs worse than the other cards too (as much as 4% perhaps). However, it's kind of hard to conceptualise what a 4% difference in performance and a 5-6 degree difference in temperature actually looks like in practice, which led me to make the post.  I'll probably end up going with the Pulse as the thermals look better and Sapphire provide a better warranty.",Negative
AMD,"I got the same one! Have you noticed much coil whine on yours? Mine has a pretty notable coil whine at full usage and I’ve gotten used to ignoring it since I haven’t wanted to play the silicon lottery and return it on the chance that the replacement doesn’t have the whine. Aside from that, it runs great, the temps are great, and the fans are silent. So for 580 bucks I feel like it was an awesome price.",Positive

AMD,"Im using 7800x3d and 32GB CL30 ram, so I guess I should have gotten at least median score. But well, it's a fantastic card anyway. My game perf is usually in the same ballpark as the ones I found online, so I guess it's just the FOMO thing.",Positive
AMD,The performance delta basically translates to single digit FPS differences in some games so it's not worth losing sleep over.  Core and Hotspot temps are typically fine on all models as well and it's the [memory temps](https://www.techspot.com/photos/article/3015-amd-radeon-9070-xt-roundup/#GPU-VRM-png) where you see bigger differences across models. I have the Hellhound and seeing it close to the bottom tracks with my experience since the card requires higher fan curves during the hotter months of the year to keep that 25-30C VRAM delta in check.,Neutral
AMD,"I don’t believe mine has much noticeable coil whine, but it definitely seems to be there. I play all my games with headphones though and I run my case fans pretty loud so I think that’s also a factor",Neutral
AMD,"In general that brands can matter Wirt drivers, not a comment on this particular hardware.",Neutral
AMD,"Applies to every bubble, by the way. PC hardware, audio, video, bikes, cars, ...   People don't see the overall picture where you can't spend the extra in every category.",Neutral
AMD,"I would argue this sub tends to aggressively recommend the bare best value products and generally always suggest getting the cheapest AIB model of a given GPU unless they *really* care about noise (apart from that aircooler over AIO, no cache drive for a game system, no X-series board, only the cores actually required for the task, etc).  Usually when you see people suggest to spend a little more it's because they're at an awkward price point where spending let's  say 10% more gets you a ton more value long term (upgrade to AM5 over AM4/LGA 1700, 16B VRAM, much faster RAM - well, at least 2,5 months ago) that's sort of stuff.",Neutral

AMD,"When HUB did thermal and noise versus performance testing of all of the available 9070XTs back in September, the reality was there wasn’t huge differences across the board in functionality, only really in looks or size and perhaps features like dual bios or not.  If you are going to have a thermally-constrained case it might not be the best choice, but otherwise it’d be similar to every other card available, plus or minus a few degrees and frames.",Neutral
AMD,"That could definitely be part of it! I don’t use headphones and my case stays pretty quiet, that combined with the coil whine being juuuust the right pitch to cut through is probably why it’s so noticeable. I’m almost certain it’s coil whine, it doesn’t sound like fans. But it’s only on some games that I’ll hear the whine, other games won’t elicit it very much so it could just be how certain games utilize the card. Thanks for the reply!

AMD,look at your CPU temperature. Maybe you left the plastic protective film on the cooler.,Neutral
AMD,It can also be the RAM if the RAM is unstable. Try running without XMP/AMP turned on at stock ddr5 ram settings. Then try each RAM stick individually.,Neutral
AMD,"If all else fails, try disabling core integrity in windows security. This helped me in a similar situation after I went as far as replacing the PSU.",Neutral
AMD,"When you say it shuts down, do you mean it just cuts out and loses power as if the pug was pulled out the wall socket? If so I had that years ago. Tell him to take the GPU out and run with the integrated graphics on the CPU for a while. Won't be able to run a great deal but just play stuff it can handle. See if it keeps happening. When I had this I replaced the PSU first but it still happened. Took the GPU out for a few weeks and had no issues. Put a new GPU in and never had another problem. Cooling was not a problem, no overclocks either. Something on the GPU was causing power loss though.",Negative
AMD,"I just had this issue a few weeks ago, also with Expedition 33. Check the power cable going into the GPU. If, at the connector, it's bent too much the pins might not fully connect and you'll have power distributed unevenly - causing some pins to overheat. This will then cause the PSU to shut down if it believes your PC is overheating.   It took me awhile to figure it out but after taking off the side panel and readjusting the cable it has never done it again.   Of course, this is just a possibility but worth trying. Good luck!",Neutral
AMD,"When I had this issue, it was bad ram causing problems. You may want to look into testing it (each stick individually) to rule that out",Negative
AMD,"check for loose/missing connections on the mobo/gpu, try running with only one stick of ram, take a sniff from the PSU vent to see if something has been cookin' inside, google around how to disable all the power saving BS in windows, do away with all power saving shit in BIOS as well, start rolling back GPU drivers, check for known issues with your motherboard / BIOS but dont fuck around reflashing it unless you know what you're doing and you are aware of the risks, pay attention to hotspot temps while running a benchmark like heaven, dont really think event viewer will log an overheating core",Neutral
AMD,"Others are correct in pointing out a power supply issue.   One thing to also check is if your PC is hooked up to a UPS/APC. If it is, the fault may lie there.",Neutral
AMD,"Also check if your gpu fans are running. Had it not long ago they weren't, and learned that way a gpu can shut down your system as well if it is overheating.  For some stupid reason amd decided to set the fan curve to all 0's, and your description fits my experience",Negative
AMD,"I have the RM1000i not x, this exact problem happened to me when ever my psu switch from single 12v rail to multiple 12v rails, I solve it by switching back to single rail.   So from my experience it's 100% psu failing, rm1000 come with 10y, I recommend that you check your warranty and claim it.   *if you can get ""i"" it's my choice from corsair, and thier hx1000i shift is my next psu 😅",Negative
AMD,either psu or overheating problem,Negative
AMD,"PSU’s cooked probably. Had the same thing just happen to me, most of the same symptoms as you do",Negative
AMD,Is it only when playing games? Or will it shut down when idling in windows as well? I had a similar situation which drove me bonkers and I troubleshot for days with similar to what you are experiencing. Although mine restarted rather than just shut down.  It ended up being a faulty wire from my mobo to my pc case power button. It was tripping my system.   I ended up disconnecting and turned my pc on via the mobo power button (was in early stages of building a new pc to bother swapping out the wire),Negative
AMD,I had a similar issue here recently and it ended up being an alert set within iCUE. It was hard to find out what in event viewer other than it saying it triggered a shut down. But iCUE had an alert set to shutdown PC if it got to 50°. Turning that off fixed the issue.,Negative
AMD,It's the PSU. I had the same thing happen where it would seem fine then shut down only on certain games. I tried diagnosing everything then just replaced my PSU and the problem went away completely.,Negative
AMD,"On top of what others have said with the PSU, sometimes a motherboard header can be over supplied. For example, you connected too many fans/RGB fans into a fan header without external supply to the PSU, this would cause games to crash too when power demand ramps up.",Negative
AMD,"Did he try updating his BIOS when he installed the 9070XT? I've encountered similar issues and the reason was outdated MB firmware, not (as I initially thought) the PSU!",Negative
AMD,had this on my pc (rx 6700xt) and my pc started having black screen while gaming with needing to restart everytime. i saw that recently there was increase of such things and what helped me was undervolting my gpu by a bit.,Negative
AMD,Had a problem like this. Tried a new psu.. Still the same. My problem was the sleeved 24pin cable was bad. Went back to my stock 24pin and no problems ever since,Negative
AMD,I had an issue where the AMD Adrenalin Software somehow became incompatible with the driver that was installed. Froze my computer and lost connection with my second monitor. Uninstalled and re-installed Adrenalin and everything was back to normal.,Negative
AMD,Sounds like overheating.  Remove and re-mount the CPU with new thermal paste?  Are all the case fans/CPU fan/GPU fan working correctly?,Neutral
AMD,Check temps. Get nzxt cam or something like that. It monitors you and cpu temps. If it's getting to hot it thermal throttles then shits down to prevent damage,Neutral
AMD,"Defective power supply is the most likely answer.   Defective motherboard is the second most likely.   CPU overheating and shutting down IS possible, but pretty unlikely (unless they're not using a cooler at all! Which, as I look at it... has OP stated which CPU cooler is actually being used?)",Neutral
AMD,This is also what happened to a friends PC when he needed to redo the thermal paste on his GPU. Everything was fine until there was demand on it.,Negative
AMD,Or a cooling issue. My PC shut down because my case fans weren't ramping up properly (incorrect settings in BIOS and it was like an oven in there. Must've been motherboard sensors triggering it because the CPU & GPU temps were in normal range.,Negative
AMD,"I had this exact same issue and replacing the psu resolved it. Old psu had plenty of power for the rig, but was just failing.",Negative
AMD,"I had the same exact issue with a Corsair PSU. My pc shut down randomly, usually during games. It also made a buzzing noise ever since I got it, probably indicated an issue already. I haven’t bought any Corsair hardware since, using a beQuiet PSU now.",Negative
AMD,"I am having the exact same issue as OP and I noticed it only happened while I had some stream going on my second monitor while gaming which leads me to believe it's a PSU issue. I replaced my motherboard first because it was having other issues and I thought perhaps it was related but at very worst I get a motherboard with working USB headers. It went away (or so it seemed) but then it happened 3 times in one night this last weekend while gaming and watching NFL on my second monitor.    My plan is to replace my PSU next week and just not have videos playing on my second monitor in the meantime. Everything on my PC has been replaced since this started happening except the PSU (through random upgrades like RAM, CPU, GPU etc).",Negative
AMD,"We already checked the outlet, and checked the power usage. But its still a concern.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep, it never goes above 50 c° sometimes in high demanding games it goes to 70°c but when we go to the event viewer it doesn't say anything about overheating",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, we used mine gpu which is a Geforce RTX 3070 Ti and it took an hr to crash instead of the usually 5 minutes.",Neutral
AMD,what voltage would you recommend thenn?,Neutral
AMD,"Huge disclaimer to make sure you get the cable that came with that PSU. But yes, a broken cable could do what OP's bf is seeing.",Neutral
AMD,"I saw in another comment that you mentioned having no crash log in event viewer right?  I was having the same trouble, could you try running some low demanding games? (Something like stardew or terraria could work). Personally for me, i was able to play some games like payday 2 and vermintide 2 for hours but everytime i launched fortnite or arc raider it would hard crash my pc after barely 5-10min idle.  I also saw your problem seems to stem from the GPU you said, faulty motherboard maybe? Even new components can be faulty sometimes. Especially if you checked with another GPU and the only difference was the time it took to crash. If you have another pc, check both gpu in that other computer to verify!",Neutral
AMD,"850W PSU is the minimum for that CPU/GPU combo. 1000W is recommended so you should be fine wattage wise. It looks like a gold model. Keep in mind the platinum and titanium versions are always better.  Looks like the Fractal case has 3 fans in the front? Any others? Rear exhaust, top exhaust, etc.  Got any more specs on the RAM? how many GB and what is the rating? 3200Mhz, 6000Mhz, etc. Were the 2 sticks a matched pair? Meaning were they sold as a kit. You can run into a lot of problems adding more RAM even if it is the exact same model if it isn't bought together as a matched kit.  I'm not sure what you are using to monitor temps. I would use Afterburner to monitor CPU and GPU temps. You can also set an on screen display to monitor temps in game with the included RTSS software. It will also allow you to set a custom fan curve to keep the GPU nice and cool.",Positive
AMD,Fixed that!!! I was waiting on 2 things that I didnt know that I had to bug him about,Neutral
AMD,He normally has an app open to see what the temps are never gets above 70 C,Neutral
AMD,"Built, he upgrades the parts every year or so. Ill ask about the rest of this",Neutral
AMD,More than enough,Positive
AMD,"He got his gpu over a year ago, he only started having this problem over 2 weeks ago",Negative
AMD,We did do a normal stress test but not one directly for ram,Neutral
AMD,"Also check if the plastic is off the block, preventing the paste from actually working",Neutral
AMD,"Yep, its a new cooler, all fans are working overtime in some games. Its a brand new PSU aswell",Positive
AMD,"I had same issue, checked everything. My issue was wrong apply of thermal paste so once it got used up and cpu was bare bones without paste it started shutting down. First i changed psu but problem persisted. And once i removed aio cooling i saw how the paste got smushed all over the place but not much left on cpu… once i changed the shutting down stopped",Negative
AMD,Thermaright FC140 CPU Air cooler,Neutral
AMD,Yeah I had this issue myself when the fan on my GPU started to fail and I didn't notice.  This was back in the days of single-fan GPUs though so YMMV.,Negative
AMD,"Yep. Was thermal paste for me, but my system was older. I redid the thermal paste on the GPU and CPU and haven't had an issue since.",Neutral
AMD,Ive had random completely shut downs and found out it was the wall outlet so I swapped it back to a surge protector on the same outlet and that fix the issue. However it may mostly be the the PSU if its only during demanding game but can't hurt to try if you haven't yet.,Neutral
AMD,"That actually sounds very normal.   Sorry was autocorrected without realizing it.  Has he gone into his bios to check ram timings for his specific ram? My sisters pc was having this issue for months.... But we live 7 hours apart and she doesn't have enough confidence to check ram timings.   When I was down for Christmas, I found the right setting for her ram on her and cpu, gigabyte mono and RAM. It's been rock solid since.",Neutral
AMD,The fact that it still happens with your card makes it seem like the PSU. The reason it happens faster with his card is because it uses more power.,Neutral
AMD,Yeah if the crashing one is 5+ years old especially it seems likely that's the issue. Interesting that your GPU also crashed though... Maybe multiple failure points.,Negative
AMD,Wattage. Recommended 850W but that's just the minimum.,Neutral
AMD,1000W is fine,Neutral
AMD,"Personally, I use PC Part Picker for everything. Let's you know exactly what you need for your rig - like voltage.",Neutral
AMD,"Keep in mind some PSU has long warranty period. I checked Corsair (assuming you have Corsair RX1000) and it has 10 years warranty. So try to RMA it, it's the least cost replacement you can do right now.",Neutral
AMD,"Also, check their BIOS dates! Ive heard there was issue with older bios for that motherboard (quick search rn gave me some videos)",Neutral
AMD,Hes been able to play Fallout new vegas and Octopath traveler 2 with little to no issues,Positive
AMD,He actually has 4 ram sticks but only using a matching set. I dont know exactly what the ram sticks are.,Neutral
AMD,"If you changed the board its probably the ram that died or one of em got a static charge , be happy it wasnt everything if thats the case. replace the Ram Lettuce know",Negative
AMD,"I'm running a very similar setup, same cou/GPU with an Asus board.  I had ram issues, a small voltage increase and docp profile II solved my issues.  I wasn't crashing every game though, only occasionally, but did crash running certain synthetic benchmarks every time.  This was a crash/freeze though for me, not a power down/shut off.",Neutral
AMD,Have you repasted the CPU thermal paste?,Neutral
AMD,"Like others have said, the most likely issue is the PSU (It was the first thing that I replaced figuring that it was the issue).  If he changes that and it still crashes, you might want to check the GPU, although if you don't have your old one or access to another one, that might be difficult.",Negative
AMD,"A normal stresstest will usually put a load on everything, so you can't confirm/eliminate the cause. A stresstest per component, like the one from AIDA64, will let you do that.",Neutral
AMD,Sounds like a defective PSU then?,Negative
AMD,"Totally enough for a 9800X3D (assuming it's running properly). I'm going back to defective power supply being the most likely cause, followed by defective motherboard.   (In truth, either is possible, and I'd call it a coin toss as to which is the most likely scenario. But since the Power supply is generally easier to replace than a motherboard, I'd start with the power supply)",Neutral
AMD,"Im not sure if he's done that yet, but I will definitely ask him",Neutral
AMD,> Has he gone into his cups  Can you clarify what you mean by this? Autocorrect BIOS or am I IOoTL?,Neutral
AMD,He just got his gpu about a year ago when his old gpu completely failed,Negative
AMD,"You should try the ram and the gpu in another (working) computer if possible, that would help know which is the issue.",Neutral
AMD,Yep,Positive
AMD,We just replaced the motherboard like 2 days ago,Neutral
AMD,We are thinking its the ram or the gpu at this point,Neutral
AMD,"I searched google and came up with the following.  To enable   [EXPO](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-e&channel=entpr&q=EXPO&ved=2ahUKEwiy5uCNpYmSAxXXHDQIHQN4NHsQgK4QegQIARAB) on your Asus X870-Plus WiFi motherboard, enter the BIOS (Delete key), press F7 for Advanced Mode, go to the **Ai Tweaker** tab, set **Ai Overclock Tuner** to **EXPO I**, then save and exit (F10) to apply the optimized RAM settings for higher performance. T",Neutral
AMD,"likely an automistake, since 'in his cups' is a (mildly archaic) metaphor for being drunk",Neutral
AMD,I was autocorrected. I meant BIOS. She has an AMD cpu on a Gigabyte. Had to switch to profile 1 EXPO settings.,Neutral
AMD,"Hmm that's not really old enough to wear out unless he's mining crypto or something. If the crashing card also has a bigger power draw, it could point back to the PSU again.",Neutral
AMD,"RAM or GPU is certainly *possible*, but RAM being defective doesn't generally cause *shutdowns* as much as it causes crashes and reboots.   Defective graphics cards, similarly, don't usually cause shutdowns. If they're defective, you'll usually see crashes, reboots, or the display simply winks out while the rest of the machine stays on.   If you've replaced the motherboard already, it's VERY likely to be a defective power supply.",Negative
AMD,"You can check the RAM by trying one stick at a time, and then the other.",Neutral
AMD,It has an integrated gpu so you can just take the graphics card off and test it. If it is a power supply issue it would probably work if you're not using the big gpu since it would be low power. If it still crashes then it might be a different issue.  You can also load up afterburner and turn the power budget down and watch the monitor. Try a benchmark software that runs the gpu hot and see if it crashes when it hits a certain watt pull. If it crashes immediately then it's not the gpu getting hot for sure.  You can also pull one stick and just use one ram stick at a time to see if it is that.  You can also do a portable build of linux and run stuff on there and see if it still crashes.,Neutral
AMD,"Haha yeah I thought it was a pretty funny/fitting autocorrect. If I had to go into BIOS to check my RAM timings I'd want to be in my cups, as well. It usually helps.",Positive
AMD,This. A dead stick of ram usually causes shut downs and BSOD that are inconsistent with no discernible pattern.,Negative
AMD,"I used to have this problem with an AMD card. I swapped to a nvidia and I've been fine ever since.  Full shutdowns randomly while gaming. Ever since covid, QC has gone to the gutter with more products.",Negative
AMD,"Im running a 7700X in my pc right now and have been met with 0 issues. Its a very good chip, especially with something more midrange like the 9060xt",Positive
AMD,"The 7700X is fantastic for AM5. It performs very well in games and everyday use, and with a 3060 XT/4060/9060 XT, it's more than enough for 1440p without any bottleneck.  The only thing to keep in mind is the temperature: it's a CPU that runs hot, so get a good cooler (a good air cooler like the AK620/Peerless Assassin or a decent AIO) and you're good to go. If the price is right, it's a great buy and also leaves you room to upgrade your GPU later without having to change platforms.",Positive
AMD,Great CPU for basically any task that you'll be doing outside of a server room.,Positive
AMD,"I'm running it in my build and it's a good cpu. I play at 1440p and a 4070 super, I didn't want to spend more on a cpu ( like a x3d) because I play mostly gpu bound games so it's enough for me.",Positive
AMD,"It's a great CPU. Depending on where you are, you might be able to get the 9600X for less, but you'll miss out on 2 cores and you'll need to flash the BIOS on a 600 series motherboard.",Positive
AMD,Yeah good CPU. Not sure on prices but 7600x is near identical in gaming and probably a decent but cheaper,Positive
AMD,I’ve been running my 7700x in my PC for almost 3 years now and it’s been a champ. It handles everything I’ve thrown at it perfectly. It’s a great CPU even after all this time and I’m sure will continue that way for quite some time.  Edit: I run my 7700x with a 4080 and have a 34in UW 1440p OLED I play games on. No issues whatsoever.,Positive
AMD,"OWNERS: Does anyone have any quick PBO settings to start out trying for the 7700x? Besides adjusting my GPU via Adrenalin, my CPU is running at stock.",Neutral
AMD,"300 euros is a LOT. Depending on what you really need, upgrading to a 5700X or similar should cost less than half and give you a good upgrade as well.",Neutral
AMD,"depends what GPU you have and resolution.  Personally I wouldn't bother with the 5700x3d if you only have like a sub $400 GPU unless the price was amazing. 300 euros may be super cheap for you guys though, i think it's like $350 on ebay.",Neutral
AMD,"No one can answer this properly without knowing what your graphics card is, screen resolution and refresh rate and what games you play.  At 300 I would try hold out, but again that depends on the above",Neutral
AMD,No,Neutral

AMD,"I upgraded my 3600x to 5800x3d for €300, 2 years ago.  Would do it again, so I say yes.",Positive
AMD,"If you're okay with paying 300 Euros... sure.   But I'm certain you can get a 5700X for at least half of that, or a 5800XT for about 30-40% less.",Neutral
AMD,7800X3Ds can be found for 280€ so ibwould say hell no !,Negative
AMD,"Depends on the gpu if you have an RTX5070/RX 9070 and above performance wise and running 1080p it will give an amazing performance gain! If you have a 1440p monitor and a gpu worse than a 5080/4090/5090 then the performance difference will be noticeable only on cpu cache intensive games! I am talking from personal experience since i got a 5700X3D to upgrade my wifes pc that had a 3700X and an arc A750 (running 1080p) and didn't notice any difference except from CS, League and Fortnite (didn't test any other cpu intensive games). When i swapped the A750 with a 9060XT 16gb and re-did the testing it was definitely a much more obvious improvement!",Positive
AMD,"No. That's overpriced and (most likely) second hand. Get a 5700x for half the price, you can find it new in shops and if anything goes wrong, you're covered with a return/warranty",Negative
AMD,"imo it is worth it - it holds up well with newer AM5 CPUs in performance without the need of upgrading the mainboard and going to DDR5. I believe that the CPU will hold its value pretty well while the DDR prices are still so high, so you should easily be able to sell it for about the same price if you want to get rid of it again.",Positive
AMD,Yes.,Positive
AMD,yes,Positive
AMD,yes,Positive
AMD,"We need more information about the rest of the system and what you play.    Generally the difference between a 5700X3D and a more pedestrian R5/R7 CPU is not worth the extra.  Any of the R5/R7 5000 series CPUs with 32 MB L3 cache is a nice bump over the 3600.    There are a few exceptions - some games *really* love that VCache, high refresh rate 1080p benefits more for example.  But if you're GPU bottlenecked in most situations the X3D isn't a huge leap.",Neutral
AMD,"you can get 5950x for 250, about 10% slower in games and much faster in multitasking",Neutral
AMD,yesssssssssssssssss,Positive
AMD,300€ is less than 350$,Neutral
AMD,But that would require a whole new motherboard and DDR5 RAM,Neutral
AMD,"New mobo, new expensive ram needed",Neutral
AMD,different socket tho.,Neutral
AMD,Upgrading am4 for gaming with non x3d in 2026 is not a very good move.,Negative
AMD,The standard Zen 3 parts hold up well enough that the X3D premium over them is kind of dubious value at current prices.  For midrange GPUs there isn’t a huge difference.,Neutral
AMD,I went from a 3600 + 5700XT @ 1080p to 5700X3D + RX6800 @ 3440x1440 and still felt the CPU upgrade significantly. But I do also play all low in competitive games.,Neutral
AMD,"it's the same, and prices in euro usually already include VAT",Neutral
AMD,"Ok. But I dunno going rate in Europe. It could be 400 euros on ebay for a used one for all I know. Our ram prices are considerably lower, I dunno the relative prices for everything.",Neutral
AMD,"It's almost the exact same price. 300 euro is 349.68 USD, but that's still overpriced for that CPU.",Neutral
AMD,I agree the real deal breaker is ddr5 fam right now. I remember when 5700x3ds were 160€,Negative
AMD,What makes you say that?  The difference between a 5800XT and a 5700X3D is [not that big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7tmuGAdO2M) in most games but the difference in price sure is.,Neutral
AMD,"RX 5700XT to RX 6800 is a fairly big uplift, especially at settings where it can really leverage the Infinity Cache.  Low settings competitive is definitely the X3D’s best showing.",Positive
AMD,"I mean $350 is the going rate on ebay. Overpriced compared to like 18 months ago of course.  I personally wouldn't be paying $350 unless I had like 64gb of DDR4 on AM4 already and needed a lot of ram still because getting 64gb of DDR5 would be obscenely expensive. In the US paying $250-300 for 32gb of ram sucks, but lets face it we're not getting back to sub $100 ever perhaps until DDR6 is a few years in and you're buying used DDR5 kits for under $100.",Negative

AMD,I would go with 5700X or 5800X. Can you tell me which 3050 it is 6GB or 8GB model?,Neutral
AMD,You should be fine right now for 1080p low settings. What version of the 3050 (6 or 8gb?). And is the monitor plugged into the GPU?,Neutral
AMD,"1080p specifically requires better CPU performance, get a 5600 or x3d CPU, then upgrade the GPU to a 3070 or higher.  32GB RAM later down the line for better 1% and 0.1% lows with a better monitor 1440p high refresh rate and you're all set!",Positive
AMD,It depends if it is 6gb or 8gb RTX 5050 but both a 5600 or a 5800xt are a solid option or and if you are a beginner plug your HDMI into your GPU if you haven't,Neutral
AMD,"Fist make sure you connected you display to the GPU so its not still using the motherboards input.   Secondly the RTX 3050 6/8gb is below the requirements for the games you mentioned so expect to heavily really on DLSS and low graphic settings. Test this and se how it performs but I'm afraid you might have a hard time getting the performance you need from that card.   When it comes to the CPU's Im not sure its holding the GPU back but a 5800xt or even the 5600x would be a big improvement so well worth the investment.   But look for used parts as much as possible, if you are lucky and find a 5800x3d/5700x3d for a fair price I would consider getting that as it should last you well into the next platform generation.   Hardware unboxed has just released two videos about how the AM4 CPUs preform today so check that out to se what will be the best match for you.",Neutral
AMD,"3050 6GB? Very slow gpu, even an old rx 6600 non-xt is over 50% faster.   As for the 4600g, its far from terrible. Yes, a 5600 would be a good bit faster but it wont make the 3050 a better gpu.   I would just get a better gpu. You can always carry it over to a new or updated rig later. ;)",Negative
AMD,6GB,Neutral
AMD,yeah that was my first thought as well . He didnt plug the monitor to the gpu lol,Neutral
AMD,"6 GB, and yes, monitor is connected to the gpu",Neutral
AMD,With an x3d OP could even go much higher with the GPU. Considering 16gb GPUs will be expensive soon a 2nd hand 4070ti or 5070 would be good contenders.,Neutral
AMD,Scratch what I said about CPU then and upgrade the GPU 12GB-16GB card is preferable.,Neutral
AMD,"Low + DLSS shouldn't be too far off this result: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTZdpHR15aY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTZdpHR15aY) It will be a bit lower though as 4600g isn't as good as the 5600.  I would try running DDU to clear out ALL of the drivers (you may have to run it twice, once for AMD and once for Nvidia), and then reinstall only the Nvidia ones fresh.

AMD,Good luck!,Positive
AMD,"For gaming I would have preferred the 9700x, but at the same time it's still a good price for what you received.",Positive
AMD,"I game on an R9 7900x and a 6950xt at 1440p and I don't typically findy CPU noticeably affecting anything in a negative way.

Up until Christmas I was 4K gaming with the same card and a 12400 on a Z690 board, which also ran very well.  The new rig was a PITA to set up: AM5 is very picky with series 9000 CPUs, especially with fast DDR5 and reused NVME drives.",Positive
AMD,"It's fine, I got the 7600x combo at microcenter and matched it with a 9060xt 16gb for my dad, and my nephew was using it for cyberpunk for hours at 1440p, played and looked great",Positive
AMD,Its a great entry level cpu.,Positive
AMD,"I'm rocking the same CPU, but with a 5070 Ti. I totally agree that this CPU isn't talked about enough. I'm more than happy with it.",Positive
AMD,Coming from a i5-7600k to a 9600x I think it's a damn good CPU!,Positive
AMD,"Yes, quite good. It's not good anymore only for new builds as ddr5 ram is very expensive so AM4 is way cheaper",Positive
AMD,>because nobody talks about it i  What?  Great combo btw.,Positive
AMD,"Especially in 4K, as the general workload will be heavily GPU dependent. Wife's got a 9600X and 5070 Ti at 4K no issues.",Neutral
AMD,For 1080p it’s one of the best CPU price to performance wise. And pairs well with mid range GPUs like 5060 Ti 16gb / 5070 but for 4k definitely want something stronger.,Positive
AMD,Yeah i’m using a 5060 TI 16gb with the 9600x and It gives me 120+ frames on Arc Raiders in 1080p and Balanced DLSS,Neutral
AMD,"Might be completely wrong, but didn’t amd integrate some sort of physx emulation in their gpus? So basically they should be capable of it given they aren’t ancient or unsupported of this feature?   Like I said I’m a bit ignorant about physx but that’s what I once heard and would love to know more",Neutral
AMD,"Nah, AMD can only run PhysX on cpu. This isn't a big deal in later versions of physX when it became more CPU friendly, however if you try to run an old PhysX game like Batman Asylum it will just run like poo (as it did for us Nvidia 5xxx series owners before latest drivers).",Neutral
AMD,Interesting.   Have you ran any benchmarks of this? Share some videos on/off with the PhysX on CPU vs. the 1030?,Neutral
AMD,It's cooked,Neutral
AMD,Try resetting the cmos (motherboard cmos reset),Neutral
AMD,"already tried that. Nvm tho i just looked at my task management and my cpu is idling at 90-something degrees, so i guess imma reapply the thermal paste and if that won’t work i’ll try to get my aio back to the place i bought it from and pray it’s still under warranty…",Negative
AMD,"Okay... Its not like there is a 8070xt nitro to challenge it, I thinks its safe.",Neutral
AMD,"No, you have to replace the power supply too. At least 650W and tier B on [THE LIST](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1akCHL7Vhzk_EhrpIGkz8zTEvYfLDcaSpZRB6Xt6JWkc/edit?usp=drivesdk)  The current one is borderline dangerous besides being a bit weak.",Negative
AMD,What happens if you reset to default all the settings in adrenaline?,Neutral
AMD,"I have a 5600x and 5800XT, with good cooler. Hands down the 5800XT being binned higher gets me a 4.6ghz all core with a Peerless Assassin SE120. Stock, I just got ram and Infinity fabric 3800/1900mhz stable. Still have loose timings.  I love how good the XT variant is but yeah 8 cores would be better if you can cool it.",Positive
AMD,Looks like your 9800x3d is trying to mimic a star explosion. Might consider moving your computer to a different universe.,Negative
AMD,Big Bang II imminent,Positive

AMD,![gif](giphy|L83H4eHwEVChg2Y6QH|downsized),Neutral
AMD,"The 3900X isn't gonna give you much gaming performance over your 3600 tbh, those extra cores don't really help for 1080p gaming     Go for a 5600X or 5700X instead - way better single core performance which is what actually matters for your bottleneck. Should find em around $200-250 AUD and you won't even need to upgrade your mobo",Negative
AMD,"I think your mobo is compatible with Zen 3 cpus , just make sure to have the latest bios update...  I would personally get an 5700X , which is a great cpu that you could get for a reasonable price I believe.",Positive
AMD,"With the right bios update your board does support 5000 series CPUs and doesn't have the most beefy VRM setup. Meaning it could run quite hot (motherboard components) with a 3900x all while not improving gaming performance that much.  I'd say get something like a Ryzen 7 5700 or X3D SKU on the same board, with a decent cooler. Doesn't have to be a big AIO, they aren't cost effective in this case. Unless you want a big AIO for asthetics of course but it's going to be overkill for relatively mundane regular systems. Don't feel like it is a need I suppose.  Edit, or keep the H60i if it's a 5700 or something similar with a low TDP. Might be on the toasty side of things though.",Neutral
AMD,How much is the 5800x/5800xt? Those or the 5700x are by far the best options.,Positive
AMD,Thanks for the advice. I'll have a look at those cpus,Positive
AMD,"Thank you, I'll have a look now",Positive
AMD,"I'll have a look at the 7 5700, I still want to get a super beefy cooler despite what you say, just because I plan on keeping it when I EVENTUALLY (depending on how long it takes for ddr5 to be a reasonable price)  also the aesthetics lol  The current aio doesn't fit my board properly for whatever reason (I have four rubber washers on the back of the plate to make it ""fit""), so thats another reason I plan on getting a new aio, or might ever just say fuck it and get the nd- h15 black noctua cooler and go back to air cooled cpu)  Edit: updating bios terrifies me, I'm afraid of messing up and killing my whole system or something idk",Neutral
AMD,The 5700x is like the exact same price brand new as the 3900x i have been looking at,Neutral
AMD,"5800x & 5800xt are quite a bit more expensive, but quite tempting",Neutral
AMD,"If the goal is keeping to long term I'd say it's a safer bet to go the air cooler route. AIOs, although generally reliable, have more points of failures and that also means it's more likely for them to not hold up longer term.  Can vouch for the NH-D15 being completely solid, I'd say it is expensive but worth it for a long term purchase, especially when you know you might eyeball really high end stuff in the future. Do check fitment though. It's quite a chonky boi.  Do also mind, my NH-D15 experience is/was like (worth it though): Want to access all RAM slots? Take off the cooler. Want to access NVME slot 1? Take off the cooler. Want to remove the graphics card? Take off the cooler. Want to remove the motherboard? Take off the cooler.  To be fair, it is scary to update a bios. Though, unless power is unstable in your area and good practices are used the risk is minimal.",Neutral
AMD,yes that’s an insane deal,Positive

AMD,"Considering the price increases the world is seeing for most major PC components and electronics in general, as well as the fact these prices aren't expected to lower any time in the distant future, I'd say that's a steal.  Stating the obvious, but just make sure all of components in the system actually match up with what is listed on the box before leaving the store. That's a real score for $900 if it all checks out though. Enjoy your new build or easy flip for profit, OP!",Neutral

AMD,"Thats the per unit price, gotta buy 30",Neutral
AMD,"And different stores just have different prices, especially different regions and if its old stock",Neutral
AMD,This is exactly how I nabbed a similar deal for the next step down in terms of specs (5060 and Intel) from Costco.  No more than a minute after they decided on a price to stick onto it did I put it in my cart and grab it.  The price of memory alone makes it an incredible deal.    I’ve actually bought four Costco clearance gaming PCs over the last 3 years for different purposes and haven’t spent above $850 thanks to the magic of NBC clearance.,Positive

OEM is great for deals like these but as an educated consumer it is bad for the long run when you wanna upgrade anything,Negative

AMD,"It's a good deal, but a 5070 is not ever worth $700. Well, I guess with the latest stop of 5070ti, maybe it is expected. But nobody was paying $700 for a non-Ti 5070 before the recent news.  You can get a 9070 XT for ~700 pretty much constantly now.",Neutral
AMD,And my axe,Neutral
AMD,"It's marked down cause it's a display item. Others likely won't be the same price. Still, they may be decent deals regardless.",Neutral

AMD,Last time I bought a display model they gave me the 3-year additional warranty for free,Neutral

AMD,With a.i. generated frames it can,Neutral
AMD,"What recent news do you speak of, I’m out of the loop.",Neutral
AMD,"I personally would take a 5070 over a 9070xt for my main rig, for a secondary rig I would go 9070xt to have something to tinker with",Neutral
AMD,Id take the 5070 over the 9070xt rightnow with dlss being as superior as it is.  The raster is better on the amd card though.  It depends what games you’re playing,Positive
AMD,Is there a visible disadvantage or an obvious risk of buying a display model?   Can you explain?,Neutral
AMD,That cpu isn't much less than that gpu...the whole build is a crazy deal.,Negative
AMD,Used a reputable credit card.  Mine added an additional year.  Read the terms of service.,Neutral
AMD,They are no longer making 5070ti GPUs.,Neutral
AMD,"Nvidia is raising prices for all the gpus, but only about 10% except for the 5090. This prices is that are going to double",Neutral
AMD,That's a wild take.,Negative
AMD,Thats just nuts. I wouldnt even take the 5070ti over the 9070xt unless the prices were the same or very close to it. Taking the non ti version over the 9070xt is just bonkers but you do you.,Negative
AMD,That’s similar to what I did. I’ve got a 5070 Ti in my main build and a 9060 XT 16GB in my secondary rig,Neutral
AMD,"They’ve been exposed to customers, the elements, and usually have a lot of time being on (if they are displayed out of box with RGB lights and stuff). There might be a possibility a component is broken or missing. Essentially it would be considered lightly used. Many retailers give discounts on display items because they are not new-in-box.",Neutral
AMD,I thought that was just asus?,Neutral
AMD,9070xt s competition is the 5070 ti.  Its not that wild.  It really does come down to what games and resolution you’re playing at.  It you’re playing unoptimized ue5 games id take the 5070 for the better up scaling and frame gen  If you play non competitive singleplayer games at 4k then the 9070xt is gonna shine,Neutral
AMD,"I went with the 5070ti from walmart a few days ago because unless you are near a microcenter, probably only to save $50 or so getting a 9070xt. I'm wondering if i should get a second one to replace 3090 in other rig now while I can.",Neutral
AMD,Appreciate the explanation. Thanks,Positive
AMD,My biggest question in these cases is: does it come with a warranty?,Neutral
AMD,Oh? I stand corrected if that's the case!,Neutral
AMD,Thought is when Nvidia's biggest partner says they're stopping because of supply the rest will follow. But we don't know for sure at this point.  Seems like Nvidia is going to funnel all the 16gb gddr7 into 5080s as they've got a higher profit margin.,Neutral
AMD,"Nah, nvidia is stopping production altogether is the story",Neutral
AMD,"Recent bought a power tool that was a display, last one left.   No warranty, no returns. But different stores have different policies.",Neutral

AMD,"I would always recommend building a PC yourself. The 9070XT is a very good Price-to-performance card and while it has some AI features it is about equal to a 7900XT (5% faster). About the watercooling, AIOs are really safe, not like custom loops. Also, I'm pretty sure if it destroys your pc they will replace everythiing that was destroyed but the odds of that are like 1/1000000000 (I use watercooling)",Positive
AMD,For 850 bucks you're not doing better and tbh you did pretty good in this market,Negative
AMD,I’d return and get the other one you listed.  So much better.  I’ve been using AIO’s for a decade or so and have never had a leak.,Positive
AMD,Yeah the case on this current one is horrendous to work on the internals with. I dont even know what the psu is because its buried somwhere in the bottom section of the case.,Negative

AMD,"I've always built my own in the past. I think pre-builds started making more sense with AI ruining the market. I hate the idea of a pre-build but here we are. About the water cooling, does it have antifreeze in it? Theres a good chance this thing could be in below freezing temps if I'm out of state for work.",Negative
AMD,"Thanks, I'm mainly annoyed that I cant apply the $165 in best buy credits to the cost of the PC. Kinda had a feeling the associate was making crap up, my fault for not verifying I guess. Like, what the hell am I gonna get at best buy for $165?",Negative
AMD,Thanks lol. Bad deal on the PC I got?,Neutral
AMD,No they don't have anywhere near the power draw that 5090 or 4090's do.,Negative
AMD,"It’s a glycol mix, nothing to worry about",Neutral
AMD,"Do they expire? If not then just buy some games there. If they do, it'd pay for most of a 2tb ssd  As far as the RAM goes 16 is probably fine for now but if you want just pick up a single stick 16gb with either the same or better specs and they'll likely pair up fine.    You could have really done a lot worse buying a 850 dollar PC on light at best research overall. If you want to finance a 2k one you can but you're in a good spot overall imo and if it's the one I'm thinking of it's even just using retail parts. Have you booted it up yet? How's it doing with the games you actually want to play?",Neutral
AMD,Also you don't need to worry about waterdooling at all. Most of us all watercool our pc's with aio's and they're totally fine,Positive
AMD,Thank you. Any idea of the freeze point? Depending if its ethylene or propylene glycol and the mix ratio the freeze point could be all over the place.,Neutral
AMD,Its working pretty good for me for the older games I play. I tried mining XMR with it and was disappointed though. Would have been 3 months for a $13 payout. The energy cost today makes most mining non-profitable but I think of it as a space heater that helps pay for its energy cost. I'm mainly worried this might be my last chance for a long time to upgrade to a modern PC. I don't think the market is getting better any time soon. And mixing ram has very mixed reviews so also worried about buying a $200 ram stick and finding out they wont pair,Neutral
AMD,I guess if if the watercooling was installed by someone that cared it would be ok. This current one had a broken screw holding a panel on and the rear cooling fan was half ass plugged in to where the lights came on but it wouldnt spin up. I had to reroute the cables to have enough slack to plug it in properly. Idk if the water cooling systems use compression fittings but want to assume its probably installed half ass and will have to chase all the connections to make sure theyre torqued properly,Negative
AMD,No idea those details are never given  I know with Infloor heat I use 30% glycol mix which nets me -10c to -15 which is more than enough insurance where I am at. However I doubt the ratio is that high in an aio. Probably closer to 10% which would give you around 0 to -5c there about.,Neutral
AMD,You don't have the plastic on top right? Even without undervolting those temps are quite high. I have the same board and cpu but use a thermalright peerless assassin and idle at around 50C and peaks at 63C with a tiny bit of undervolting.,Neutral
AMD,Have you checked your fan curves ?,Neutral
AMD,"Mine ran cooler with a cheaper Be Quiet on it. Most of the time I was in the mid 70's (as max) when gaming (mostly GPU heavy). Deffo not normal.  Check your voltages, PBO settings, compare Bios versions, etc.  Could try to swap coolers and/or cpu's with your friend and run some tests. Just to rule them out as the culprit....",Neutral
AMD,"If your cooler/thermal paste/fan curves are all good, then its most likely something in the bios, cpu is being fed too much voltage etc....try reset the bios to optimised defaults...and download the lastest bios firmware, see if that fixes anything.",Neutral
AMD,Thats very high for our processor. I never get over 60c even while gaming,Negative
AMD,"Check thermal paste brotherman, mine is max 70c-75c, bf6 on ultras, arc raiders and marvel rivals, also i think iam going to change my paste, cuz done it a bit wrong, just not now. Also i have big spikes while comp shaders in rivals, max was 85-90c, but this is normal, iam not on AIO, have 2 big fans. Also mine res is 1080p and paired with 9070xt. Dunno maybe fans working bad? Or psu cabels are bad connected to cpu? My issue was like i dont mount cooler enough, so paste is not really good, I fixed it after one day, but some paste already dried up.",Neutral

AMD,"Whatever AMD say, they always do the opposite way.",Negative
AMD,"Well, if the MSRP rises this statement will still be true...",Neutral
AMD,Lmao. The cards have not been msrp since launch so what's the fucking point,Negative
AMD,IMO amd needs to set up a registered gamers list people can register on. And allow them to buy GPUs at MSRP during trying times . . . AMD also needs to work with memory suppliers and others to make sure their supply chain has the capacity to meet the demand of the registry.  would be a huge PR win for AMD and a big win for gamers who want a GPU too. I think the caveate would be you need to register 12+ months prior or something like that so AMD can make sure they have supply chain deals set up.,Positive
AMD,"Deep down, I think we all know this is PR bullshit- it's the PR equivalent of 'just the tip'. They'll do whatever makes them the most profit.  -  At the end of the day, AMD and all other publicly traded companies in the US have a legal obligation to make the most profit for their shareholders that they can. For those who haven't suffered through this sort of drudge, it's a precedent called [investor/shareholder primacy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder_primacy)",Negative

AMD,The MSRP does not include VAT/sales tax because taxes vary by region.  We should compare the pre-tax prices to MSRP.,Neutral

AMD,"They have been at or below MSRP for the last few months before the RAM prices skyrocketed.  I purchased an Asrock Challenger 9070 XT for $570 at Microcenter around Black Friday ($541 with the MC card).  They also had the PowerColor Reeper 9070 XT at the same price.  As recently as early January, MC had a 9070 XT for $580, and now it’s at the $599 MSRP.  However; they have a 9070 non-XT for $499 today, $50 below MSRP.",Neutral

I was saying it for RX 7000, when they said they didn't have a generational price increase, while not stating their Nvidia 80 series competitor was rebranded from a 6800 XT to a 7900 XTX, effectively raising that performance tier from $650 to $1,000. I said it for Ryzen 9000, when they rebranded the 65W parts as ""X"" products, so they could again remove include coolers.",Neutral

AMD,Fundamentally though it's a suggested price. And we saw the prices regress to MSRP over time. So what are your expectations?,Neutral
AMD,"Well ones a market leader who still introduces updates and tech for existing customers on older architectures, and the other is all but entirely pulling the plug on older archs for support and features.

If the price sits there for 10 minutes at launch, and the same products are immediately increase in price, and the non-""MSRP"" models didn't get price incentives, it's marketing bullshit used to make them look good.

The manufacturer isn't the one selling the goods, and while ideally yes the seller of the goods would adhere to the MSRP, there are often good reasons why it's not always possible.

AMD,"Then with all of those variables considered, why not set a reasonable MSRP?  It's not unreasonable to expect an MSRP that is in line with final pricing.",Neutral
AMD,They got as much support as they needed.   FSR4 is rightly only officially supported by the cards that can run the full version.,Positive
AMD,Would you have preferred a higher MSRP that they could consistently hit?,Neutral
AMD,"The msrp they set did happen though, it just took the retailers/aibs a few months to get there(which isnt really amds fault). Only in Europe though since US has tarriffs.",Neutral
AMD,> They got as much support as they needed.  As a former VII owner: lol bullshit.   >FSR4 is rightly only officially supported by the cards that can run the full version.  We'll just ignore the int8 version they accidentally released. And we'll ignore how this community has done nothing but whinge about hardware locked functions if it comes from a different company. And ignore the complete lack of fore-thought from RTG as always.,Negative
AMD,"What more did you want? It was based on an outdated architecture from day 1.   The community can do what they want with it, but development resources should not be wasted trying to support FSR 4 on RDNA 3, especially if it comes to the detriment of development on RDNA 4 cards.",Negative
AMD,"> What more did you want? It was based on an outdated architecture from day 1.  Yes lets excuse a company for a bad product, a lack of investment in software, shit drivers, and lacking support. And zero forward thinking.   Meanwhile the RTX 2080 which released a year earlier for the same price saw a lot longer useful lifespan, feature, and drive support.   And they repeated it again basically pulling the plug on RDNA2 and RDNA3 because they still weren't forward thinking or investing in the right things. But hey it will probably happen to RDNA4 when UDNA rolls around too, so at least they're fair ish in shafting the people that buy their GPUs.   >The community can do what they want with it, but development resources should not be wasted trying to support FSR 4 on RDNA 3, especially if it comes to the detriment of development on RDNA 4 cards.  Given their track record I doubt any further development occurs, especially since their market share is at an all time low. It will probably have a few more promises, be implemented in a few games, and then put out to pasture when their next arch drops.   They'll keep bleeding market share and existing in GPUs just enough to keep anti-trust off Nvidia while still doing the bare minimum.",Negative

AMD,amazon currently has the 9800x3d sitting at $470  though I do suppose it does have a 30 day return policy and jeff bezos has enough money if the 9850 is significantly better and/or the price of the 9800x3d comes down.,Neutral
AMD,Bro it won’t be significantly better. I think in their keynote they said what 5% ? It was single digits best case scenarios . It’s basically a “KS” sku compared to a “K” sku in terms of intel chips. It will likely be priced higher it IS the best gaming chip.     I suppose you can wait and hope that the current x3d will drop in price  . OR  it could be priced high enough to not cause a price drop on current sku,Negative

AMD,More RDNA3 crap.  AMD is Radeon's worst enemy.,Negative
AMD,There damn well better be dozens of mini PCs and laptops using the Max+ 388 with NO discrete GPU. But let's just wait and see how OEMs fuck this up. They always do. It is the perfect laptop/tablet/miniPC chip. I want it. Now.,Negative
AMD,"All I want from AMD is a balanced APU, a solid CPU and a solid GPU. I genuinely don’t understand this weird obsession companies have with slapping a midrange GPU next to an absurdly overkill CPU. Why can’t we get a Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7 level CPU paired with something like an 8060S?   Instead, it’s always a top of the lone Ryzen 9 or Intel i9 equivalent paired with what’s basically a midrange GPU. All that does is jack up the cost for no real benefit and push the final price way higher than it needs to be. A 12 core CPU driving a 60 TFLOP GPU is still massive overkill, and it just feels like wasted silicon and money to me.",Negative
AMD,"iGPUs are becoming an exciting field. The Intel ARC B390 is showing itself to be a bloody awesome little iGPU & if this progress continues, I wager my next PC will probably just be a mini PC with an iGPU.",Positive

AMD,So a hx 370 upgrade with 8060 the graphics. Okay how much?,Neutral
AMD,"the 395's 16 core CPU is just absurdly overkill for most people, the 388/392's 8/12 core CPUs are much more sane (and definitely cheaper)",Negative
AMD,If you're planning on steam os you'll have fsr4 through decky.,Neutral
AMD,IMHO it won't be cheap enough over CPU + dGPU combo - and it's system you can upgrade.,Neutral
AMD,"In my experience, the 385 already fits the bill. I got the Framework Desktop mobo, shopped around for deals on the other components, managed to get a sub-4L build for about $1000. Installed Bazzite, logged in to Steam, and was gaming within minutes.  The only lingering flaw - and granted, it IS a pretty major flaw at the moment considering the use case - is that Sleep doesn't work properly and seems to cut power to both USB and the network card even after waking. I'm confident I'll resolve whatever the issue is, but until then, being sure to power down after every session isn't a very difficult thing to do, especially since the only thing I'm using it for is gaming.",Neutral
AMD,We have the same idea 😅.   388 steam machine + jellyfin server sounds banger if the price doesn't suck,Positive
AMD,"I use it on my GPD Win5 anyway. Still the best upscaling (1080p, performance mode)",Positive

AMD,My first thought reading about this too,Neutral
AMD,Wrong order lol.,Negative
AMD,"I’m hoping the 8 core model is the sweet spot. The 395 is way overkill in the cpu department and ram department for the average user.   Not all of us want gobs of ultra fast ram to run hot dog/not hot dog. Some of use just want a decent apu for low power, quiet couch gaming.",Negative

AMD,395 is around $1500-2000 so probably 1k plus since hx370 is very expensive still,Neutral
AMD,Agreed. Although I did buy a 395+ framework desktop 😂,Neutral
AMD,395 isn't meant for most people.,Negative
AMD,I was looking into this and there is a use case you may be missing. This will give you steam machine performance in a 2-3L PC case. Getting a dGPU into something like the MS-A2 (closest comparison I can come up with easily) requires jumping through a ton of hoops and will be more expensive besides.   This has a very niche use case compared to what you suggested and if money is a concern at all your solution is probably better.,Neutral
AMD,You will most likely be able to grab a cheap Chinese mini pc which will beat any cpu + gpu combo in terms of value and size . As a 1080p steam box it would be great heck even the current 870m is decent enough for 1080p gaming . An 8745h machine is like $350 for a fully built system.  I’m not suggesting it’s for everyone but there is definitely a strong use case,Positive
AMD,Looking for the stability of a APU device. The simplicity and stability is worth a premium price imo.,Positive
AMD,I guess we wait and see,Neutral
AMD,I've been using an 8700g for the past couple of years and it's fine for 1080p/low gaming but in all these SFF systems it's the GPU that's the bottleneck.  I have no doubt the 8050s is a great improvement on the 780m but I'd still rather have the 8060s,Neutral
AMD,"How many watts does it run at, and how long does a battery charge last?  I'd like to maintain a stable, true 60 FPS for 2-3 hours without it feeling like a turbine.  A low preset would be fine, especially in modern titles like Cyberpunk, Gothic Remake, etc.",Neutral
AMD,Read the article. Amd didn't announce any device.  These are likely from the full press kit released ahead of the keynote.,Neutral
AMD,“Needs super fast ram”  Why? Any ram should suffice or is this a downside of an APU?,Negative
AMD,"Seems like you are right, as I just heard from the Youtuber Crimsom Tech that Asus TUF A14 will have a variant with Strix Halo.",Neutral
AMD,OOOOh yeah baby. If we get 'full performance' over a USB Type C connection im in.,Positive
AMD,"Honestly their most surprising announcement, and that's counting the Zephyrus Duo, the GoPro Proart PX13 and the Flow Z13 x Hideo Kojima colab",Positive
AMD,they will just get DLSS 4.5 too now.,Neutral
AMD,"People even excused AMD for *actual* fake pricing.  I remember launch day of RDNA4 people here and on r/radeon going to buy the card, but the subsidized stock was gone so they bought it for $800... when their whole reason for buying was the fake MSRP.",Negative
AMD,Right but at one point they didnt back dlss to the 10 series. They can't. Amd also cant just slap the same fsr on rdna3 without drawbacks. They gotta make a version for rdna 3.5. Rdna3 should be getting one as well.,Negative
AMD,"Thanks so much for sharing this, it completely flew under my radar, it's definitely one I'm going to be keeping my eye on as I liked the design on the 2025 model. I would ideally prefer 16 inch but I love how this laptop has 2x m.2 so it will make it really easy to just slot my old SSD in and go.  I'm not worried much about the price, I wouldn't mind going a bit over £2000 for a 64gb model, definitely one I'm going to keep an eye on.",Positive
AMD,They said 16 inches,Neutral
AMD,The 385 has a worse GPU than the 395. The 388 doesn’t.,Negative
AMD,Nah I phrased it deliberately.  ATi was a top tier graphics card company; AMD bought them and turned them to shit.,Negative
AMD,"I was considering a framework desktop, how are you liking it?",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, if you are into very-SFF then this can do things other builds can't. Current Framework and Chinese Strix Halo 395 boards are priced at like $2700+ and with current DRAM shenanigans 388 with 32GB RAM may loose the price advantage it initially would have. Steam Machine will win this one by a big margin I guess.",Neutral
AMD,"i mean, a low profile 5060 will fit in a case thats only very slightly larger, I put one in a dragon range minisforum a few months ago.",Neutral
AMD,How would that compare to something like the Minisforum HX99G?  It can be found pretty inexpensively refurbished.,Neutral
AMD,"I'd love a tablet like the Misinforum V3, but revamped with a proper kickstand like the ASUS ROG Flow Z13 and Surface Pro have, an OLED screen, a detachable Bluetooth keyboard like the Surface Pro 13 has (Flex Keyboard), and the DP-in the V3 has, with the Max+ 388 chipset.  That'd be my dream portable device, hands-down.",Positive

AMD,They only announced the AI MAX chips,Neutral
AMD,"Massive iGPU that shares bandwidth with the CPU. Both need a ton of bandwidth so if you just put ""any RAM"" you're gonna lose a ton of performance.",Negative
AMD,The major thing holding igpu’s back from better performance is ram speed - ddr5 just isn’t fast enough to work as vram. What’s unique about strix halo is that it uses soldered lpddr5x instead of ddr5 modules to improve gpu performance.,Negative
AMD,Appreciate the teachings of my fellow redditors,Positive
AMD,"the 2026 TUF is claiming up to 95W maximum power usage, so even 100W chargers can give full performance",Positive
AMD,Remember Zen5% as well,Neutral
AMD,"That's what people are expecting.  Sure we all know that FP8 isn't on RDNA3... But there's other instruction sets that could work, there's Some AI hardware there to be used there at some level. No one is expecting to get FSR4 on an rx 580 or an RX 5700XT... maybe 6000 series, but 7000 series should've been guaranteed.  It's the LEAST they could do.",Neutral
AMD,"yea idk why not a single tech journalist or content creator noticed while they were on Asus's booth, literally only Crimson Tech noticed",Negative
AMD,"they weren't top tier, they were also below nvidia most of the time. same as today really.",Negative
AMD,Ohhhh fair enough. I thought you meant that Radeon are holding AMD back (which they are rn).,Neutral
AMD,"Radeon's most successful period was under AMD from 2008-2013. They carried AMD for a lot of that time while their CPU division faltered.  Also ATI were in financial trouble when AMD bought them, so it was unlikely they could have continued without a buyout.",Neutral
AMD,"It's cool. Using it exclusively for llm models. It acts as the backend for OpenWeb uI. Since the nic is only 5Gb, I keep the models on the device. Eventually I'm going to put it in another case so I can use the x4 slot for a 25G card and centralize my model storage.  But performance is strong all things considered. It doesn't chug when trying to generate a result. I think the biggest delay is the time from when it loads the model requested into memory before it starts processing",Positive
AMD,"Looking through the CES news, I saw that AMD teased a reference dev box. They called it the Ryzen AI Halo. A AI Max+ 395 with 128GB. If there is even just a hint of them dropping this thing with a ""reasonable"" price tag in Germany, I'll just grab one of those.  My hopes for a decent sub-2L chassis with a 388 and 64GB of RAM feel rather slim. I rather avoid the possibility of filing a warranty claim against a Chinese brand.",Neutral
AMD,"I’m still waiting to see what we actually get from the steam machine personally, We still need specs and price point. My current htpc gaming setup is 15L which is tiny considering what it’s packing (3900x+3090) but I wouldn’t be opposed to something in the USFF if it’s at a “reasonable” price and competes in the same ballpark.",Neutral
AMD,"Honestly, the ms-02 ultra is what I was considering if using dgpu but it is almost twice the size. I would be hard pressed to beat the 3090 in my 15L so it needs to be a usff case or be close to matching my current rig in a slightly larger form factor (2-5L).",Neutral
AMD,Performance wise I have no clue but design wise it fills the same general market.  Hits in the same ballpark as a mobile 3060. The AI chips supposedly play in the 4000 series mobile range so better I guess.  I didn’t even know the HX99G existed until now and as a refurb in the sub $500 range barebones I don’t think I would be disappointed.,Positive

AMD,"Still learning this whole AI chip deal. The power efficiency of Core Ultra cpus interest me, but at what cost is always my first thought.",Neutral
AMD,It's really that they use 8 memory channels rather than the typical 2,Neutral
AMD,"The usage itself is not unique, the unique thing is that it's mandatory. You won't find Strix Halo with SO-DIMM memory because AMD doesn't allow it.",Neutral
AMD,"There is INT8 and I used to work on there last I know is that them corporate heads dont want to backport to be released RDNA3/RDNA3.5. Their RDNA4 was stopgap and fooled consumers enough to buy them and they might not even know if RDNA4 will be even supported in the future, haha.",Negative
AMD,They’d lagged a bit but they still competed in the high end and in the early 2000s made halo products like the 9800 XT. Since their acquisition they’ve exclusively been “the cheaper alternative” and since Turing they’ve been generations behind.  The only new graphics tech I can think of from AMD era Radeon was the TressFX hair rendering (which basically only ran on Radeon cards).,Neutral

AMD,"it's a 256 bit interface instead of the usual 128 bit, ie. 8 32-bit channels vs the normal 4 (which are usually still referred to as dual channel since we are used to talking in 64-bit channels)",Neutral
AMD,Framework said they asked amd about upgradeable ram (sodium or lpcamm I dont recall exactly) and amd tried but couldn't get the signal integrity right without sacrificing bandwidth (and let's not kid ourselves those large igpus are dependent on the insane 256GB/s bandwidth that strix halo has) At least that is what I remember reading back when the framework desktop was announced,Negative

AMD,"Trying to centralize my model storage, 2.5G takes a while to load the bigger models.   Also, looks like newer engines are implementing RDMA which will allow more distributed execution and it's not possible to do over the existing nics",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, all correct, signal integrity when using DIMM memory is a bitch. Not to mention the complexity of the resulting board itself would be pain, you need 4 slots at least. Yikes.",Negative
AMD,Because the competition is launching more exciting products that I wish my company would launch. To me laptops are really important segment as I can use it to explain to people what I used to do at work easily but eith Strix Point/Halo being so damn expensive and uncompetitive it just brings me a tinge of sadness.,Positive
AMD,"If you don't mind asking, which split specifically are you using for *glm-4.7 q2*?",Neutral
AMD,"I mean what would you need it for, in your use case? Is it for Jellyfin to stream faster?",Neutral
AMD,Use rclone instead of rsync or standard copy-paste for initial model uploads so that you can better saturate the bandwidth and do not use a switch do peer to peer it absolutely 0 benefit and adds latency and overhead unless multiple devices are connected to the central storage and that you cna not do peer to peer for some reason. Also  use a script to trigger a read of the model file into the storage server's RAM cache before the worker nodes request it so that the you cna leverage the full wire speed  also use a storage node and install a PCIe Gen5 NVMe SSD. If you are gonna use a dedicated storage server use  ZFS Mirror or RAID-Z with multiple NVMe drives. You can use RDMA but you need a RoCE-capable NIC and if you re gonna get a Nic dont get a single 25g get dual since the pci4x4 port can support it and you can aggregate it. Also you can leverage like zram and cache the data in the ram. Both on the machine and on the storage  and  try to keep it in the ram or have it swap it to the zram on the storage one since its superior to the disk.,Neutral
AMD,"No, jellyfin does not need that much bandwidth; many tvs come with only 100 Mbit ethernet, and the streaming platform with the highest quality streams (Apple TV) top at about 50 Mbit.  The GP gave a hint: centrally storing LLM models. These files can be huge (e.g. gpt-oss-120b has ~64 GB, llama-3.3-70b has ~37 GB, glm-4.7 depending on quantization can have 100-250 GB), so you need as much bandwidth as possible when loading them over network.",Neutral

AMD,They couldn't announce this at CES instead of the whole AI shitstain?  Dumbest timeline,Negative
AMD,Personally I don't see the need to push the igpu any higher. If I wanted a dgpu I would buy a laptop with one.   I want faster and more efficient cores.,Neutral

AMD,"Time is money for productivity use cases tho. It’s situational, I don’t game much but it was easy for me to go with the 9950x3d for just an extra $100, especially when you’re likely pairing it with a 5090 if not 5080 as a top spec video editing rig.   A 4% improvement to a 4 hour render is 10 minutes saved, so it does add up quickly.",Positive
AMD,"It’s not a 4% improvement to the render, that was part of the point of that. It’s 4% to specific workloads within the program that are not a sizeable chunk of program time.  Your render time is wholly GPU driven in Davinci. Most of the actions done on the timeline and in color grading are also wholly GPU driven. The chip won’t save 4% of your time unless those specific actions are all you’re doing for some reason.  If you’re spending a lot of time in Unreal on tasks like shader compilations? Sure, that’s gonna save time and arguments could be made for it. Particularly since that line of work also often ends up running said unreal project, which itself benefits from the chip.  “don’t find the additional gaming performance worth the price increase over the 9950X and 9900X” is a literal quote from the article right after saying they can’t recommend the chips for every workflow, among a couple others, as a reason not to spend the extra money and the article is assuming MSRP that only puts them 50 apart.  Edit: 4% is within Pugent’s margin of error, as an aside.  Edit2: since people get territorial over this kind of stuff sometimes. I *have* an x3d chip. As I mentioned originally there’s essentially no difference in most workloads, it’s primarily a gaming chip. If you need the best option for gaming get one. If you need the best option for productivity specifically then there’s a big ol’ pause there with a lot of asterisks.",Neutral
AMD,"If AMD ever gets it together, the NPU could be used to offload AMD noise reduction and can also cleanup live webcam images too.  Otherwise, it has better uses in a more integrated system like a laptop.

AMD,"No. That would just be a separate engineered die.   Ryzen desktop series are chiplet based. There’s a cpu chiplet connected to an i/o die chiplet on an am4/am5 socket. Note that zen4/5 include a small 2 CU gpu in the cpu die chiplet for basic video output purposes.   Ryzen mobile series are monolithic, no chiplets.

AMD,It’s still not handled by the NPU tho,Neutral
AMD,"Great explanation. Especially the monolithic vs. chiplet design is important to note, physically they are totally different.  I've got a passively cooled desktop system and for that purpose these G parts are also a great fit. Due to the monolithic die the idle power consumption is notably lower, which is what you want when you need maximum efficiency for limited cooling capacity.",Positive

AMD,"let me have my fun, it's night time",Positive
AMD,"No it just allows the buffer to be **resizeable** the access remains the same.  And no they did not mention the iGPU once, they said NPU. And even if it could, what would the benefit be? Games render using one GPU or the other, not both. So why access an inactive GPU's VRAM data? Even if you could write to it like extra memory, that defeats the entire point of VRAM, it's just far far too slow, it would kill performance.  So again what are THEY talking about?",Neutral
AMD,"BAR = Base Address Register.  In short, it's the address range of system memory that gets mapped to graphics memory.  Which part of graphics memory it points to is changed as required.  The size of the register is relatively small by default, because the system address range it occupies is no longer accessible as normal RAM, and with a 32-bit system that only has 4GB of address space, reserving a large chunk of that space for mapped graphics memory will impact system performance.  Resizable BAR just means you can change the size of that register, so that you can write to more of the graphics memory at once, without changing the mapping.  With a 64-bit operating system, you have plenty of address space that doesn't go anywhere near physical memory to work with, so you can map the entire size of the graphics memory to a system address without causing any issues.  AMD's SAM *uses* resizable BAR functionality, but is not simply their label for it.  There's a bit more going on in what they do with it, which is why AMD cards designed with SAM in mind gain more than other cards that merely encounter a larger BAR.  An exception can be made for modern Intel cards, which were designed with a large BAR in mind, and are actually crippled with a small one.  This is more them being lazy on implementing VRAM access properly for a small BAR than them gaining performance from a large BAR.  In all cases, the graphics memory is accessed ""directly"".  It's only a question of how large the mapped address area is, and where in VRAM it's pointing at any given moment.",Neutral

There is small wonder intel is simply superior in every aspect of mobile computing   ... now if only they can put out a game focus desktop chip they will stop losing buyers there,Negative
AMD,"I bought 32 GB DDR4 ram in 9th of June last year for 101 e. Just checked the price of that exact same kit from where I bought it and it's now 303 e. Really drove home how insane the prices are getting.  Also looking at price charts, it seems my timing was pretty good, since price for DDR4 shot up in mid June and has kept rising since. So, I probably should also mention, I ordered a new GPU on Sunday.",Negative
AMD,Getting close to going with an actual r/ayymd CPU name,Neutral
AMD,The thing is standard businesses aren't buying products *because* they have AI branding. AI branding is just tech bro circlejerk bs designed to give the venture capitalists their dopamine hit so they give the company more money to continue this charade.,Negative
AMD,"However, that's also what allows them to avoid the scammers when new products launch and to give their deals.",Positive
AMD,All of which I'm OK with.,Positive
AMD,"I got a 7600X3D the other week for my living room gaming box.  It will no doubt still be GPU limited, but it was pretty inexpensive for an AM5 chip.",Positive
AMD,Managing a bunch of SKUs and confusing customers has basically been AMD's entire mobile strategy.,Negative
AMD,and pull out their rx 580 for memes,Neutral
AMD,"Redid my comp just this past week (9800x3D, 32GB RAM, etc.) and helped some family on that front with redoing hardware or picking out new laptops. Prices are higher than I like but some of the builds were going on their 8-9th year of operation. Better to eat the cost of DDR5 now when it's at local stores for about 200-300, than be forced to eat it later in the year when stuffs more apocalyptic. The 5800x3D I swapped out in my build already sells for more than a new 9800x3D on ebay judging by listings.   Some friends are also swapping their GPUs while they are still MSRP.",Neutral
AMD,Not necessarily a bad thing. I tried playing with the power limit set to the minimum on my 9070XT and I was surprised how little performance it lost. And the card was dead quiet while only drawing 200W or so.   Hopefully they will put a decent heatsink on it so that it will be silent.,Neutral
AMD,"9070XT with a 9070 BIOS or just 9070, -20% power limit, put in an x4 slot/mode",Neutral
AMD,Why not just use a 9070 instead?,Neutral
AMD,"My 9070XT is amazing at -25% PL and -40 undervolt. Like, almost dead quiet at arms length during heavy gameplay. That's a 3 fan model, tho.  I wonder what a skinny 2 fan can do at 180w. Probably not even close to a full TDP 9070.   Can't help but wonder if they can put this GPU in a steamachine like desktop thingy.",Positive
AMD,Meanwhile I want a 500W+ BIOS bc I'm on water.,Neutral
AMD,Yeah looks like a size constrained limitation  Theres probably no AC to 12V 300W PSU in that size range,Negative
AMD,"I'm guessing you could get slightly better performance with the ""more slower cores"" approach than ""faster but fewer cores""?.  Sounds like a waste of a premium chip, though.",Negative
AMD,"My Asus ROG NUC 2025 houses a 140W 5070 TI mobile that handles it fine. Within it is also a CPU that can boost up to 120W as necessary.   GPU's don't need to be as large as they are, there's more than enough space for heatsinks to run that GPU at 180w.   I doubt it'll be worth the price, the use cases for these things are the niche of niches at such a price point.",Positive
AMD,you got a boat? that’s sick bro I want to be on the water too,Negative
AMD,This. I'm really hoping someone can figure out how to modify existing 9070 XT BIOSes to increase the power limit more than 10%.,Neutral

AMD,9800X3D + some mhz or whatever.  Good lord hardware releases are boring right now.,Negative
AMD,"I imagine it looks a lot like a 9800X3D, except it says 9850X3D instead, since you know, it's exactly the same CPU, just binned. What even is this? What happened to journalism?",Negative
AMD,I’m still waiting to hear if the 9850X3D will support PBO and/or overclocking. If no then the gap to the 9800X3D is effectively even less.,Neutral
AMD,"Do new sites even do basic thinking these days? Fake as hell, there's no way the IHS says 2024, considering AMD transitions that date super fast, with the 9950X3D, manufactured in the second week of January 2025, already having a 2025 date on the IHS. The real 9850X3D will have a 2025 date at least, if not a 2026 one.",Negative
AMD,"Bro thinks hes god, what a loser.",Negative
AMD,"That's what happen when one company dominate a certain market. Just like when Intel released their quad cores CPU years after years. Now it's AMD being successful with the CPU market, Intel really lost their customers after multiple CPU issues.",Neutral

AMD,?  All of the retail samples of the 9950X3D have a 2024 year date printed on them.,Neutral
AMD,If they have pushed the silicon to the absolute limit already it may have no headroom left.,Negative
AMD,"Exactly, it's not the manufacturing date but the trademark date.",Neutral
AMD,"So they tried to NOT release it for desktops to save their video card business and then the Chinese took the Strix Halo and put it into mini pcs which meant the big computer companies lost out to selling them to consumers.  Now they are making desktop chips because everyone is upset with them. At least it will decrease the current rip off prices for the Strix halo mini pcs in the future, albeit distant future…",Negative
AMD,I don’t think they refused to sell to mainstream oems. I think nobody wanted it for the price they wanted to sell them for. Hence they had to add the 388 and 392 to make it cheaper but still 40CU. It also can’t be sold as an AM5 cpu because it’s not compatible.,Negative
AMD,Strix Halo can't work on the desktop because it has a 4 channel memory controller. These are just embedded parts with ECC and additional certification and testing.,Negative
AMD,I had forgotten that the gap between that and the 9800X3D was so huge,Neutral
AMD,"Playing at 4K (7900xtx, 5800x3D) my bottleneck is not my cpu :-) .   Ill wait for AM6.",Neutral
AMD,"man, if I could just jump to a 5700x3d, it would be a huge upgrade. 16MB L3 cache in the 5500 is a huge bottleneck for some games (like Cyberpunk)  in Brazil you can't find these chips for less than 800 dollars lol.",Positive
AMD,I was under the impression that even older RAM sticks now are already skyrocketing as well.,Neutral
AMD,"Got onto AM4 earlier in 2025 to find 5800X3D already being sold out, and snagged 5700X3D instead.  Really want to move to AM5, but might be holding onto this for a long time.",Negative
AMD,"Started on AM4 with a 2700x, now sitting with a 5800x3d and the same board. I have zero reason to move off this chip in the foreseeable future.   I also started with a GTX 1070, and moved to a 6900XT at release. I'm confident it can take another GPU upgrade down the road still.",Neutral

AMD,Meanwhile I just upgraded my 6 year old CPU with a 14600k last week and reused my existing ddr4 ram lol. The price was far cheaper than the 5800x3d and the performance upgrade is absolutely insane. It even routinely beats most ddr5 systems as well in productivity tasks and emulation.,Positive
AMD,5800X3D & 9070 XT 💪,Neutral
AMD,if amd's marketing didn't come out of stupidtown they would have already had 12 and 16 core zen 3D on the market along 8 and 6 core variants,Neutral
AMD,What would the results show at 1440p? I understand difference between 9800x3d and 5800x3d would be smaller but by how much?,Neutral
AMD,Would be a great upgrade for my 3700X.,Positive
AMD,Unfortunately my bottleneck is not the 2600X.,Negative
AMD,I guess 5090 owners are not interested in 5800x3d,Negative
AMD,Upgrade GPU to 5070ti...paired with my 5800X3D....seems like a good combo ..will skip Zen 5 for now..,Positive
AMD,Yeah would be a day 1 purchase for me. I wasn't aware they will be discontinued and missed the boat sadly.,Negative
AMD,I have a 5900X and my plan was to upgrade with the generation after 9800X3D.... looks like it will be very expensive...,Negative
AMD,"the key takeaway is that 5800x3d gamers can upgrade GPU in 2027 for GTA 6 or Witcher 4, then maybe finally upgrade CPU in another 3-4 years time",Positive
AMD,"By the time I found out about the RAM prices, 64gb was already €600+. I looked for something second hand and managed to score a 5800X3D, a TUF B550 WIFI II and 4x8GB of DDR4 for €500. The bottleneck now is my 7800XT, but I'm not going to upgrade anytime soon. I have been using the leaked INT8 FSR4 and I'm happy with the results that gives.",Neutral
AMD,them releasing zen4 with the old ddr4 iod would be absolute cinema. 6000 series is there for the taking. wonder if there is that level of compatibility between infinity fabric versions,Positive

AMD,14600k is clear winner here. For 170 its a steal,Positive
AMD,I hate myself for not getting a 5700x3d for 150 bucks from aliexpress.,Negative
AMD,still rocking a 5700X3D combined with a 5070 TI & 128GB DDR4.  It feels fine and my pc never feels slow. Maybe i'll upgrade when DDR6 is a thing and hopefully the AI bubble is burst and parts are affordable again.,Positive
AMD,"i grow tired of these reviewers and benchmark results that only have a meaningful 1% lows, still providing the most irrelevant and useless metric being average, and lack .1% or at the very least, frame pacing graphs, the latter of which is the MOST reliable means of showing a proper metric.",Negative
AMD,Best CPU of 2022 against best CPUs of 2023/2024.    A result you could have seen by just... checking the reviews of said CPUs in 2024.,Neutral
AMD,"Oh, he has his serious face on, that's how we know this is serious.",Neutral
AMD,"should have added 7800x3d ,its easily the best value x3d performance part rn",Positive
AMD,Or just crank the graphics settings until the CPU isn’t the bottleneck. This shouldn’t be too hard. The Venn Diagram of 5080/9070XT users and non-3D AM4 CPU users has got to be pretty slim.,Neutral
AMD,I really really really don't get this and will continue to say this:     buy an 5950x. it's just a few percent slower in half the games and in the other half of use cases (and games) it's faster then the x3D.      this AM4 x3D hype is getting ridiculous and there is a better alternative available. yes. I said better.,Negative
AMD,"Next they say, bring back win98.  technology advances to fast for these guys on youtube to keep up",Neutral
AMD,yes I did this upgrade in April 5800X3D to 9800X3D is a huge jump.,Positive
AMD,Depends on the resolution and GPU I suppose. 1080p on a 5090 shows the gap. Say 4k on a 9070XT and the gap would be a lot smaller.,Neutral
AMD,"Assuming a 3 year delta between the two, back in the old days it would have been what... a 150% increase? I think the 5800x3d was the GOAT CPU but that was mostly because of the uplift between simulation style games.  Of course that does not excuse Intel for being such shit.",Neutral
AMD,"the worst part right now, is that a 5800x3d is at a highest price than a 9800x3d...",Negative
AMD,Ditto,Neutral
AMD,"I got my 9800X3D about a year ago, I can't wait to replace it in 5-7 years.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah, people freak out way too much about CPU. They upgrade the CPU despite not having any CPU bottleneck. My 12900k with DDR4 and a4080super can easily push 120+fps with zero CPU bottlenecking. People should start using tools like Afterburner to actually check their bottlenecks and not just assume.  If you are on AM4 a 5700x will do the trick most of the time. No need to buy into AM5 and DDR5 at current prices.",Neutral
AMD,Actually lol… 7900xtx too w a 5800x3d to 9800x3d and my 5800xt was the bottleneck,Neutral
AMD,_oblivion remastered enters the chat_,Neutral
AMD,Yeah because your gpu is not fast. My old 5800x3d bottlenecked the shit out of my 5090 in many games even at 4k,Negative
AMD,Are you sure? Because you probably use dlss. Which is effectively not 4k,Neutral
AMD,IIRC in latin american you have the 5500X3D which has a 96 MB L3,Neutral
AMD,"Is Cyberpunk known for being particularly CPU intensive? That makes me feel better about the slightly disappointing performance  on it after I upgraded my GPU, especially with crowd density set at high (granted I'm still on a 3600 so knew there was big potential for bottlenecking on that front).",Negative
AMD,"I can confirm this, I started out with a 5500 and then moved to a 5600x with 32MB of cache. MAN the DIFFERENCE that made was unbelievable lol. I will be getting a 5800x3D if they are brought back",Positive
AMD,obligatory this is a product for people already on AM4 not new computers,Neutral
AMD,This is for people who's already on AM4.  Plenty of people with R5 3600 or 5600 looking to get better performance would benefit a lot from an upgrade to a 5700X3D or 5800X3D,Positive
AMD,"Yeah, bought 32 GB last June for 101 eur, checked the price of the exact same kit from the same store and it was 303 eur. Prices had started rising mid June. According to the chart I saw, DDR4 prices went up before DDR5, which started rising in the Fall.",Neutral
AMD,Yeah it is nuts. I ordered 2x32GB DDR4 sticks back in 2023 and their price has almost tripled based on Amazon pricing.,Negative
AMD,Only DDR3 and older are not skyrocketing.,Neutral
AMD,Why did you go AM4 so late and not just AM5 in 2025?,Negative
AMD,Have fun buying DDR5.,Positive
AMD,"I recently picked up the AM5 bundle at micro center (9800X3D, 32GB DDR5, B650E-E) for $680 with the main justification being that I’ll make most of if not all my money back from selling my AM4 parts because holy shit 5700X3Ds go for a stupid amount these days.",Neutral
AMD,I got offered 400€ for my 5700x3D. Crazy times lol.,Neutral
AMD,"Those already exist?  The 7 nm prototypes never made it to market, likely for performance reasons they were not measurably better than this chip.  And I mean, they already solved these issues with the 7900X3D which was probably designed \~4.5 years ago.  Their CPU design teams are likely working on Zen 7 and Zen 8 at this point. They're not going to go back to a Zen 3 chip to try to workaround AM4 limitations to deliver a real 5950X3D in 2028 that would require a major BIOS update, be limited to very specific boards and high-end memory.",Negative
AMD,I fail to see why a double CCD X3D chip would be desirable.  If you are gaming then you want your game to be on one CCD to avoid inter-die communication latency. The second die being X3D is just raising manufacturing cost.  If you are rendering / number-cruching then X3D variants don't provide a benefit. Lower clocked ones usually lose out to their non-X3D counterparts when a large L3 cache is not needed.,Negative
AMD,Its not vs its about 5700x3d and 5800x3d in modern games 9800x3d is just for scale,Neutral
AMD,Sure? But it's easier this way,Neutral
AMD,The gaps have actually gotten wider,Neutral
AMD,"5900X with a new 9070XT here and for my 3440x1440 @ 160HZ purposes with I'm still really well served, considering myself a heavy user. Been playing through some RT titles like Cyberpunk and GTAV:E, while having good productivity for my coding needs.  I wouldn't know what to upgrade for at the moment, to me it's just not worth the cost. I'd e.g. have more value from going OLED.",Positive
AMD,"Same, upgraded a few months ago right when ram prices started to climb. Was a crazy big jump for a cpu upgrade",Neutral
AMD,"when I upgraded from a 5800x3d to a 9800x3d, I played civ 6 on the largest map with the most AI players using mods.   I used a save game with a turn that had no player interactions (rare).  The 9800x3d was 40% faster on turn time.",Neutral
AMD,"I think thats the distinction that a lot of people fail to make. Even with a more reasonable GPU like a 5070ti, you're still gonna see the most difference at lower resolutions. 4k maxed, probably not. Trying to max a 240 Hz 1440p monitor, it could matter.  I think its good to see the benchmarks to evaluate how CPUs have changed over generations and how they scale across different games. But inevitably these type of videos quickly devolve to people using them to  either justify their upgrade or why they don't need to upgrade any time soon.",Neutral
AMD,"Ever since upscaling tech matured, I can't remember the last time I ran a game at native 4k. Especially with DLSS 4.5 (on a 4090) there just doesn't seem to be a reason to. I'd assume most people are upscaling from 1080p or 1440p at this point, and the 9800x3d definitely makes a difference there. I assume FSR4 isn't gonna be much different      Though there's a great few games nowadays that even benefit at 4k due to being so CPU heavy.",Negative
AMD,"Yes because this is CPU test, not GPU",Neutral
AMD,"Luckily HUB has benchmarks for just about everything. Cued up to 1440P Ultra results, 4k follows right after. 5800X3D is about in the ballpark of the 7600X (remember all those Zen 5% jokes)  [HUB: CPU/GPU Scaling: 7600X vs. 9800X3D (RTX 5090, 5080, RX 9070 & 9060 XT)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpN4nyftQ3M&t=1080s)",Positive
AMD,"Well, sure, but there are games that are very CPU demanding even on 4k, like Space Marine 2 or Star Citizen.    If you anticipate being mostly GPU bottlenecked, the upgrade is less essential. But if you run a mix, you might want to consider a faster CPU. Especially now that prices have not become stupid yet.",Neutral
AMD,"I mean yeah, when you're CPU bound you're going to see differences that you wouldn't see when you're not CPU bound. A CPU intensive game is going to show those differences even at 4K on a 9070XT. Because the one CPU is faster than the other one, but as always you will only ever see that if you are doing something that needs the CPU's horsepower.",Neutral
AMD,"Intel will come back, don’t worry.  !RemindMe 5 years “Call me an oracle”",Positive
AMD,"5800x3d was always super expensive , the 5700x3d is a godsend.",Positive

AMD,Same. My plan is to keep it until they release the last X3D for my am5 platform.,Neutral
AMD,"I kept playing on a 4790K till I got a 3900X, replaced by a 5800X3d... and I hope it will keep as long as that 4790k did. Also, I just bought a brand new MSI motherboard for that 4790K.",Positive
AMD,5700x non3d is still fully capable and no slouch.,Positive
AMD,5600x is fine for most.,Positive
AMD,"It's not a matter of bottleneck, but having your needs met. What people must understand and ACCEPT is that there will ALWAYS be something bottlenecking your performance. Always. What matters is if you achieve your goals with your computer parts. That's it.",Neutral
AMD,All of my main games go below 60fps or otherwise have gametime slowdown undesirably on the best (OC'd) CPU's due to CPU bottlenecking lol  You probably just play a subset of games that aren't very cpu heavy,Negative
AMD,I have hundreds of hours in the game using the 5700x3d paired with an RX 9070 xt. It's gorgeous and runs flawless at 1440 p.,Positive
AMD,"Why would you have a 5090 without the best CPU you could get, which is 1/5 the price of the 5090.",Neutral
AMD,no doubt I had a 5800X3D + 7900XTX and at 1440UW there was a small amount of bottlenecking. Even a 4090 is bottlenecked alot by a 5800X3D with a 5090 forget about it.  Below 4k a 5800X3D + 4070 Ti is a good combo anything faster than that you will to limit the gpu.,Neutral
AMD,Lol the driver overhead from your 5090 certainly contributed to that,Neutral
AMD,Yes that's what i meant. For 4K I probably need to replace my GPU before my CPU 😀 . I'm mostly sim racing so my cpu is pretty strong still. Doubt ill see too much dif on a 9800x3d with the same gpu .   I sold my 1 kidney already to buy the 7900xtx on launch so selling the other one  for AM5 is not an option !,Neutral
AMD,"Idk why you’re being downvoted, I upgraded from 5800x3d to a 9800x3d with the same 3080ti and everything is way smoother. star citizen got a big bump in frames and it’s so much smoother.",Positive
AMD,Nope. I don't do any false frames  4k native  res only !,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, and albeit it's on average 10% slower than the R7 5700X3D is still much better than the R5 5500 and closer to the R5 7500F/7600 in performance.",Positive
AMD,"yeah, especially in Phantom Liberty.",Neutral
AMD,Or for people who already have DDR4. Like if you have a 7700k then a 5800X3D will be a big upgrade and you can re-use the RAM which is one of the most expensive components to buy right now.,Neutral
AMD,"You can't even buy these CPUs at MSRP anymore, this is a circlejerk video.",Negative
AMD,Blows my mind that people can't understand this.,Negative
AMD,He's implying and rightfully so that this is a way to get around high DDR5 prices.  So this would be for new computers if you don't want those high prices. However hes also saying that he thinks DDR4 is affected as well.  Which btw I don't think is the case.,Neutral
AMD,Sounds like a legit plan to me. Glad that AMD has done a fair amount of work trying to keep sockets relevant for so long.,Positive
AMD,"Yet! Doesn't matter if it's a stick of RAM or a weird stuffed animal with sharp teeth; if there's enough market demand, prices will rise.    It happened with DDR2 several years ago, albeit mercifully it wasn't as bad.",Negative
AMD,"Freebie!  Was on 9th-gen Intel, and this was a bit of a bump in performance.",Positive
AMD,"Dude, you can sell DDR4 for also substantial money and cover good part of BS pricing. Already calculated, it's not worth buying R7 5800X3D for anything above $250, because it's just cheaper to sell what you have and get AM5 on DDR5. And you bet AMD will slam like $450 MSRP on restock if they go for it. At that price, just get R5 7500F, and spend the difference on RAM with further upgrade paths.",Neutral
AMD,"I got 8 sticks lying around for my 14700k system i was planning to build and my 12600k. Have about 16 sticks of ddr4 though i will prob try to get rid off. Whenever i see a ram deal I buy it, its kinda an ocd thing.",Neutral
AMD,If only Microcenter is available around the world.,Neutral

AMD,I got a 9950x3d now but at first I had my old 5800x3d,Neutral
AMD,Theres no reason to just waste money on the rest of your build because you splurged on one part. So every 5090 owner should have a 9800x3d? Lol nah.,Negative

AMD,"It will improve, but not by an appreciable amount, and won’t perform significantly better than the 8core X3D part.   As for productivity, some benchmarks might see some gains. But you’ll find a few edge cases where the performance would skyrocket just because some memory bound dataset dealing with random data happens to get an unexpectedly high hit rate on the L3.   The majority of them will however perform near identically. Games are typically “Low IPC” workloads. Not much stuff being done, but it needs to react to things fast.  But productivity software is “High IPC” and the optimization targets in the software and even the compilers simply aren’t designing for CPUs that have this much L3 cache.   They know what a normal CPUs latencies are, and ensure their software is always able to keep the average CPU engine fully fed never waiting for data.  AMD offers some X3D server parts for certain workloads. And they have X3D on all the CCDs. But they aren’t nearly as popular as the classic ones.",Negative
AMD,We'll have to wait and see in the benchmarks. My initial guess is there _may_ be improvements at 1080p if there are games that can benefit from that many cores but for 4k I doubt it'll matter since we're always GPU limited.,Neutral

AMD,"One thing seems fairly certain about dual x3d CCDs, its going to be a toasty boi and (less certain but highly probable) wont be as fast for gaming as the 9850x3d",Negative
AMD,"In theory yes, in ""real"" situations probably not.  For gaming, you already have enough cores with 3d cache on a 9950x3d, same for (general) productive work, we don't know about the latency between both cdcs yet.  What will gain a massive amount of performance is stuff that is built to use the L3 cache because now you have double the amount of cdc then before.  Still probably better to wait for ZEN6.",Neutral
AMD,"It will improve gaming performance in all of the games where, at stock, the 9800X3D out-performed the 9950X3D.  The ""at stock"" means in the absence of something like *Process Lasso* to ensure the game only ran on the CCD with V-cache, which erases the deficit already.  Outside of that scenario, there are few games which will run faster on the 9950X3D2 over a properly scheduled 9950X3D.  At least right now.",Positive
AMD,"Some games that can utilize it will improve significantly, something like Star Citizen I imagine would love the extra cache.  Other games will improve immensely compared to the 50/50 x3d-chips like the 7900x3d simply because their OS can't mess up the core-parking since both chiplets are x3d now.  Still other games will have minor improvements from the small uplift in boost clock.  If you're into pure productivity use, a non x3d-chip is probably the way to go as it clocks higher and will chew through serial tasks faster. Maybe it makes a difference if you're doing 3d-art stuff, not sure.",Positive
AMD,It's for nothing basically.. just for some niche apps,Negative
AMD,"It will be interesting to see if there are any gaming benefits, but I'm sure there are applications that will use all that sweet cache. Probably rendering and handbrake for a start. 9800x3d, or rather 9850x3d now might still be the best gaming cpu.",Positive
AMD,"Yes, but there's a couple ways to get around it. Besides there's some people that keep asking for it, and it will make an interesting baseline for the next couple CPU gens.   Rumors exist future architectures may package the CCDs closer together to mitigate the latency. Plus we are getting more cores per CCD.",Positive
AMD,"Yes. This is only a problem because people talk as if X3D is black magic. It just extra L3 cache. The vertically stacked ""3D"" part is just how they're able to squeeze that more cache onto the die.  L3 cache is orders of magnitude faster than even RAM, so any time the CPU can get the data it needs from cache instead of even having to go out to RAM, you get better performance. This applies to everything a CPU does, as well, not just gaming. Gaming simply benefits greatly because, as a workload, it tends to use a lot of the same data over and over again, which means you get a lot of cache hits. A bigger cache means more data can be stored and, the chance of a cache hit versus a miss is greater, as a result. That's it. The entire secret sauce to X3D.  The reason already that the second CCD is disabled is because of the two pools of cache are separate. If a thread on CCD0 requests data, it's added to the the cache on CCD0. If a thread on CCD1 requests the same data, that's not in *its* cache, so you either call it a miss and move on or cross over the fabric to check the cache on CCD0. That instantly slows it down, though, to the point where you might as well have pulled it fresh from memory. Therefore, the way to extract the most performance is to make sure all the threads that are accessing the same cached data are using the same pool of cache, and the way you do that on a multi CCD design is to disable the other CCD.  Adding more cache to the second CCD doesn't solve this problem. The existing cache on the second CCD could already be utilized, if it made any sense to, and all that mattered was more cache overall. It just makes it so that any thread, regardless of which CCD it's on, has access to a large pool of cache. But, you would still want to confine the work for a single application entirely to one CCD to extract the most benefit. It doesn't help gaming at all. It could have some limited productivity benefits.",Neutral
AMD,"Maybe for gaming, but if you use these for compute intensive work and know how to nice your processes, they will go lightning fast.",Positive
AMD,"I think it was not a useful change since each CCD has separate L3 cache so going across the infinity fabric means not using the same cache and adding latency. AMD said they didn't think it would be a useful configuration.  But ""give the people what they want"" is a saying for a reason and people keep begging for both CCDs to be 3D cache",Negative
AMD,"No. Cache is not something that adding more of can hurt. The rest of the die is rumored to be the same, just now both dies have 96MB L3 cache instead of just the one.   Will some workloads *not benefit*? Maybe. But this change doesn't *add* latency. The latency you speak of is already there with your 9950x3d. (Ok.. +2ns to 3DV cache vs the standard L3 layer).",Neutral
AMD,"I think the idea is that the games will still only run on one ccd as per usual, but now you don’t have to worry about making sure the game is on the correct one since they both have the 3D cache",Neutral

AMD,"Doesn't mean people won't buy it anyway. But I think you're right, I assume it will use core parking the same as the 9950x3d I really don't see the point of having an extra v-cache CCD that's doing nothing while gaming.  I hope I'm wrong and it does turn out to be really cool.",Neutral
AMD,"Absolutely, there won't be any gains for gaming",Negative
AMD,"it improves performance by an appreciable amount due to the homogeneous configuration in specific scenarios.  the inter CCD latency would be more predictable because the core-cache config is symmetric  games? forget project lasso  productivity? memory intensive software like WinRAR should see a considerable performance increase due to having stored the all the dictionary or a bigger portion of it inside the on-die cache.  the performance increase is noticeable, but in very specific scenarios",Positive

AMD,"It's exactly the opposite.  If you run a game on both the V-cache CCD and normal CCD of a 9950X3D, that's when you'd have a lot of cross-CCD traffic to consider.  With both CCD's having V-cache, that scenario goes away, because running code on both CCD's will quickly end up having the same data in cache on each.",Neutral

AMD,"No, because the core problems remain. The reason the second CCD is disabled for the game is to keep all the game threads on the same CCD using the same pool of cache. The X3D CCD is chosen, obviously, because of the higher pool of cache, but either crossing CCDs and/or using two separate pools of cache would slow down performance, and that's still going to be a problem, regardless of if you added more cache to the second CCD. You could potentially play two games at the same time, both with the performance of a 9800X3D, each with their own CCD, but that would obviously be a fairly niche use case.",Neutral

AMD,"It's not about the latency that's added due to the large cache he's talking about, it's about cross talk CCD latency aka infinity fabric and I assume also specifically for games.  Most games only use a few threads and we already park the 2nd CCD due to it missing the cache + cross talk latency, so it begs the question how much does adding a second 3d cache really benefit that? If we stop parking the cores we get the cross talk latency which is probably gonna be worse in that scenario, especially because games are very latency sensitive.",Neutral
AMD,You didn't get his question,Neutral
AMD,"Actually it can hurt. More cache, more area, more latency. There will be a point on the cost benefit curve when it crosses from a positive into a negative.  At 5ghz there is only enough time for the signal to travel about 3-4 centimeters before the next cycle begins. You need things to be physical close, or you have to wait cycles in between requests. The more area you add, the more cycles you need to wait.  Just think about it logically, take the supposition to the extreme; imagine an infinite cache, the latency would be infinite.  -----  In this case its not adding more cache to the same ccd, but to the other ccd that lacks it. There wont be any additional latency concerns, so it should be a net positive. However, for anything that sits on one ccd, its not going to help at all. On ryzen, each ccd can only write to its own caches. One ccd can not go and write to the other ccd. It can however snoop the cache of the other ccd(and it must to ensure memory coherency), but this adds cross talk over the infinity fabric. Too much cross talk can likewise hurt performance instead of help. Again i dont think this will be an issue in this case. Its just there is such a thing as too much cache.",Negative
AMD,Unfortunately you still need to worry about making sure the game is only running on 1 CCD. I have a dual CCD CPU (7900) and every time a game is split between CCDs it stutters. It will do the same even if both CCDs have V-Cache.,Negative
AMD,"i thought both don't get 3d cache  they would just doubling the size of the v cache on one ccd ,so core parking is still a issue , i have a 9950x3d and id never upgrade other then finding a way to give both ccds v cache to make core parking a thing of the past but gaining a few Fps due to a double sized vcache on one CCD is just a money grabbing refresh",Negative
AMD,I see this as more of a proof of concept SKU...not really all that useful but its a step forward in some ways and people that just want the best will buy it. Future SKUs will be what you should be watching to see if they can make this better in a way that is more meaningful.,Positive

AMD,"You still won't want game threads crossing CCDs. The SerDes interconnect is still not fast enough, nor does it offer enough throughput for cache-cache transfers (and doesn't have this capability). All data will hit system memory if it needs to traverse another CCD. This is a significant latency hit vs V-cache, at least for first transfers. After that, data should be in both CCDs' caches, but there's not really a good way to control workloads with dependencies without locking to a single CCD. Otherwise, threads on both CCDs will stall as they wait for data from one another, traversing system memory, as all cached data is present in RAM.  Parallel ops with independent workloads can task both CCDs without much issue.  EDIT: There might be a way to optimize traffic in software, if it's intelligent and catches op dependencies from traversing CCDs. But, as usual, this has overhead and can still allow some edge cases to cross. Better to have some type of data traffic QoS than nothing though or we're back to parking the other CCD, which seems wasteful to me. Background tasks should operate on the secondary CCD at minimum.

Fanout/sea-of-wires can certainly move in this direction, but honestly, an expensive active interposer or active bridge die might be the only way to get more benefits. A lot of hardware logic is actually needed to bridge CCDs, so maybe AMD doesn't feel it's worth the transistor cost, as each design has strict transistor budgets.

It's not like the clockspeed of the GPU doubled (not even close, 2600 vs 2900 MHz) either so ain't no way that half assed version is going to totally match the old one, nevermind *improve* as one might expect when buying something newer.  So in my case since at the time the 7640U model was constantly going in and out of stock while the AI 5 340 just costs more for less I ended up splitting the difference and getting the Core Ultra 5 125H model instead, at least Intel only cut 12.5% of the GPU cores instead of 50% when dropping from the 7 tier to the 5 tier.",Negative

AMD,"Bingo  Strix is also limited by being RDNA 3.5 and no FSR4, so it's rather dependent on raw throughput, and it can't possibly fit in a comfortable handheld that would last for more than an hour and a half under load.  I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage.

And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.

But all I need to know is it's faaar bigger.  >panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus  That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations.

AMD,"Well Panther uses mixed processes, and hybrid tiles are bound to be a bit less space efficient than putting everything on a single die.

Case and point, AMD's R9 Fury X. Released with 4096bit bus HBM. Had a total memory bandwidth of 512GB/s. Yet the GTX 980 Ti released with a 384bit bus and 336GB/s memory bandwidth and it out performed the Fury X in pretty much everything.

They don't care if ARL on paper or on theory is some great reset. Perf, power, and cost is what's important.   >he 285K is suffering from the acute growing pains of decoupling the compute complex from the uncore in a way that creates a distinct latency penalty that enthusiasts are mistaking for regression.  It's not being ""mistaken"" for a regression, it quite literally is one.   The problem is also that AMD also has disaggregated their compute from their IMC, and yet has *better* latency on *less advanced* packaging.   >The controversy here isn't that Intel failed to push frequency; it is that they deliberately chose to execute a hard pivot away from the monolithic brute force strategy of Raptor Lake to a disaggregated chiplet design that prioritizes area efficiency and performance-per-watt over raw, latency-sensitive throughput.  Nothing about ARL's current design prioritizes ppw or area efficiency over RPL's design from a chiplets vs monolithic perspective. ARL isn't enabling higher core counts from going chiplets, that seems to be left to NVL according to rumors. And chiplets carries an area penalty over monolithic designs anyway.   >The removal of Hyper-Threading from the Lion Cove P-cores is the most contentious yet logically sound decision engineers could have made given the thermal constraints of modern silicon.   This makes no sense   >By removing the simultaneous multithreading logic, specifically the duplication of architectural state and the complexity required in the reorder buffers and schedulers to handle two threads, Intel was able to physically widen the core and increase the L2 cache per core to 3MB without blowing up the die size  SMT costs Zen 5 less than 5% in area btw.

AMD,"AMD had a very similar experience with their first generation of Ryzen CPUs. One of the differences here is Intel had a competitive product prior to their architectural shakeup. Had Intel totally croaked for years and not been competitive in the CPU space the narrative would be completely different and everyone would be singing their praises.  Aside from that I think the biggest problem with this new architecture is simply there's little reason to buy in. It was only recently (if memory serves, I could be wrong on this) announced that the next generation of CPUs will share this platform and later ones will be on a new socket. When AM4 was announced we knew that it would persist for multiple generations and now with AM5 - why would you buy a board that will be obsolete when its time to upgrade when you could buy into a platform that will support your next 1-2 CPUs?

AMD,"IMO corrupt tech sites and tech YouTubers are behind ARL’s failure for two reasons.   The first: AMD MCM processors without 3D cache are bad for gaming, and it’s hard to find this information in 90% of charts to warn intel about the consequences of going down this path, even though they should have done their own tests and experiments.   The second: in my own tests, the 265K was 15% faster than the 9700X on launch BIOS. Through BIOS updates, that gap extended to 20%, making it only 7%-10% slower than the 14700K. Yet on some very questionable charts, the 265K is shown as slower than the 9700X.   For experienced users, RPL CPUs’ temperatures can be lowered by 20°C by turning Hyper-Threading off and undervolting. For inexperienced users, ARL is better, as it runs 20°C cooler out of the box.   I believe that in 2026 we deserve raw, unedited video benchmarks that start from the desktop, show full system specs, then enter game-by-game benchmarking—no more charts with zero evidence to back them up.   When I tried to confront HUB with my benchmarks, I got blocked to cover up their lies and corruption. If they truly cared about which CPU is faster, they would share their in-game benchmark scores and discuss them in a scientific way, but that’s not their goal. The numbers go up and down for the highest bidders.   Lastly, I believe Nova Lake, with its expected 144 MB cache, will be faster than Zen 6 X3D by 10–20% as 9700x in real world is 20% slower than 265k and if both got the same IPC uplift NL will end up on top.

AMD,"285K seems to have fantastic workstation performance, I didn't think much before selecting Intel over AMD parts for work to be honest, considering the efficiency gains. We landed on 265K, it benches very favorably compared to AM5 parts in nearly every workload except for gaming, and even then, that's mostly the X3D parts, and even then, that's when there is virtually no GPU bottleneck.   Most initial ""gaming"" reviews were done exclusively with 5090s, which is extremely unrealistic for most gamers and gave an extremely false impression that you would see a massive uplift by buying this part compared with the alternative CPU parts in gaming.   A lot of reviewers such as HUB have done a lot of work to correct this impression with a variety of testing scenarios and explaining their reasoning behind removing the GPU limiting factor as much as possible in benchmarks. Incidentally, these reviews typically showed that anything less than a 5080 sees virtually no benefit with a 9800X3D versus, say, a 9700X, and incidentally the two parts that saw no discernible benefits were the Radeon 9070XT and the 9070.  Obviously, if you have a 5090 and an unlimited budget with price being no factor, your best bet for top tier performance in all categories is a 9950X3D, but that just isn't what most people are looking at.  I myself bought into the future proofing mentality with my CPU and bought a 9800X3D, and ironically bought another AMD Radeon 9070XT to pair it with, a GPU that seems literally no performance gain compared to a 9700X, let alone a 285K. The same 285K that takes a dump all over the 9800X3D in nearly every other productivity benchmark.  I guess the good news is that when I upgrade my GPU in 2-4 years, at least I'll take advantage of the 9800X3D in games, lol. But considering it cost me over $900 for CPU, RAM, and motherboard, that's cold comfort.

AMD,"I suspect they just didn't have enough time to change anything. MTL releasing in Dec 2023, internal testing I'm sure yielding some set of data, and external reviews giving other feedback, even by the release of MTL, ARL has probably been in the pipeline for years and probably locked into certain design choices regardless of the feedback and testing.  Additionally I suspect that on mobile chips/laptop gaming rigs there's less focus on each individual part because  a) few people hardcore game on laptops b) the latency can be blamed on other things since laptops are a prepackaged consortium of parts and it's harder to isolate, and  c) therefore laptops tend to be evaluated as a whole rather than the individual pieces that comprise them.   Therefore the ""latency issues"" only became a massive kerfuffle when the offending cpu could be isolated and tested alone, and reviewers needed something to complain about.   That's even if Intel was considering latency as the issue everyone made it out to be. Intel could have looked at it and considered the latency worth the cost to improve in other areas and serve as intels seminal desktop entry utilizing disaggregated silicon. Then gamers came and lost their shit that the newest Intel chip deprioritized something that impacted their precious fps- even though the impact was ""the new one is approximately the same to maybe a little worse as last gen in most games"".   Notwithstanding the fact that the 200 series chips retain healthy gen-to-gen perf uplift and a _massive efficiency improvement_ in productivity and general computing, and boosting the NGU and D2D clocks (which are _very_ low from the factory, and can be done with the app that Intel _has specifically designed for tuning their chips_ and is freely available (XTU)) brings the gaming performance to ""approximately the same to a little better in most games"". Contrary to what some people may think these chips are not solely or even majority used for gaming and there are other use cases Intel can to think about/chose to prioritize.   To be fair, gamers and tech enthusiasts are the ones who will care the most and therefore have a disproportionately large impact on the kind of publicity the chip will get. So, was this intels smartest PR decision? Maybe not. But I think it was still a sound engineering decision, regardless of whether or not they had feedback or data on the issue, even if it didn't go over very well with their loudest customer base.  And this is all overshadowed by the fact that if you stuck even the most hardcore of gamers on a blind trial and told them to identify what kind of chip they were gaming on, I have a hard time believing any of them would be able to tell with any certainty which is which.   Once you get to 60 fps, the vast majority of people stop caring. Whats five fps going to do to radically change your gaming experience so much that it's unplayable? Which brings me back to one of my original points: If you care _that much_, you can go spend your money _elsewhere_.",Neutral

AMD,"Let me explain why it will not degrade my CPU.  1. **TVB (Thermal Velocity Boost) is disabled when I set the turbo limit.** 2. **Current is not the issue.** First, even Intel chips were failing at idle. Second, you stated that ""the same power limit at lower voltage necessarily means more current."" That is incorrect, if it drew more current, then why does lowering voltage reduce power consumption? Have you missed basic physics? 3. **CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve.** The main issue was that either the CPU or the motherboard was supplying excessive voltage, or the CPU was requesting too much. Higher voltage is required for extreme single-core boosts, such as 5.9 GHz. This is why i3 and i5 CPUs were not affected. When I limit my boost and apply an undervolt, the CPU no longer requests high voltage. It might request slightly higher voltage for 5.5 GHz, but that is nowhere near the voltage required for a 5.9 GHz boost. 4. **The same principle applies.**  Its seems you are a failure of high life form.   Maybe read here more. it was already to high voltage   [https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop-Instability-Root-Cause/post/1633239](https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop-Instability-Root-Cause/post/1633239)  Maybe you havent read much. if you undervolted only using AC/DC loadline and didnt limit max frequency.

I fail to see how we went from talking about a failing architecture, which I don't think of Intel's product line as, to the whole bailout discussion. Maybe because I said AMD didn't get bailed out? I think maybe you forget that AMD had to offload global foundries, I don't think anyone even blinked when that happened and it's likely because that was a different era.   My post had nothing to do with the bailout versus architecture (or saving it) , apart from mentioning that I don't believe as a consumer I should feel motivated to buy Intel over AMD, or any other American firm, at the moment.   To be very clear, as this is personal for you, I do own Intel equipment including an Arc graphics setup for one of my children. I'm not anti-Intel or anti-American at all.   I know the history between AMD and Intel fairly well. Oversimplifying, AMD as it is doesn't exist without Intel. AMD only grew because they were the most successful second source producer for Intel, and the most successful at riding the thin grey line between patient infringement and unique implementation of similar IP that kept them alive while everyone else in the X86 space either died or became irrelevant to the consumer or enterprise space. After Itanium, the story levels out with both companies becoming effectively unwilling AMD64 codependents, and I'm saying that humorously.   Intel would gladly own the X86 market outright. So would AMD. At the end of the day, we need the two driving innovation through competition. Even if the CHIPS Act, the government stock acquisition, and the nVidia partnership are solely aimed at bringing more, needed, chip manufacturing to the US, it could create a situation where that amount of leverage puts Intel into a hyper dominant position again in the near future.

Broadwell-E and early Skylake also weren’t great for OC.   -Once the node matured, things improved again. Coffee Lake (refined 14nm) made 5 GHz relatively easy. The same pattern repeats with 10nm: Alder Lake (12th gen) came after Tiger Lake and could already reach ~5 GHz, while Raptor Lake pushed clocks even higher, up to ~5.7 GHz.

AMD,"The entire Intel board probably should have been sacked, but Gelsinger as well. He failed at his main mission and drove the company into a crisis. That kind of thing should have consequences.",Negative
AMD,Who was it that decided to exit the SSD business.  They sold off a cash cow for pennies on the dollar.,Negative
AMD,Nvidia is at least some what believable. AMD though?,Neutral
AMD,"I thought that too. At least they'd have some money coming in. But apparently it takes years to rejig the plants to churn out RAM instead of CPUs. And they're heavily invested in getting the next gen CPU fabs working.   Pivoting to RAM just doesn't make sense, unless they magic'd up a new type of RAM that's cheap to make and has super low latency - which is one thing I've always thought they ought to do.   Imagine if external RAM ran with super low latencies like CL1 or CL2 or something. You wouldn't even need branch prediction and prefetch and massive caches in the CPUs.",Neutral

AMD,This isn't wallstreetbets. We don't talk like that here.,Negative
AMD,">If you are referring to an article like the one linked below, they later clarified that 10A was supposed to begin development in 2027, not production.  Yup, and to make it even more obvious, the same graph also has Intel 14A showing up early 2026, and 20/18A showing up at the start of 2023*,* so clearly it's not the date of when the node is going to come out (or even start HVM).",Neutral
AMD,"Dunno why this is being downvoted, the CEO of Intel himself said that 14A is a 28-29 node in the Q2 2025 earnings call.",Neutral
AMD,enough info about how intel names products exists to know. if it didn't increase in transistor density per mm it would not be called 10A.,Neutral
AMD,"I think everyone knows there will be continued Q1 and possibly Q2 layoffs.   Return to office didn't lead to enough voluntary attrition. Leadership wants to hit a magic number which sounds good for financial reports, not what is actually viable to run things.",Negative
AMD,That crazy amount of cash being spent by Pat is what enabled 18A and 14A. They HAD to buy multuple $250 Litho machines from ASML in order to make that possible. Pat was playing catch up after years of under-investment by Swan and Krzanich. It was necessary and LBT is getting the credit. You don't appear to understand the lead times required in the semi industry. Pat understood that. The mistakes Pat made were trying to build a fab in Ohio and not cutting headcount and getting rid of dead weight sooner.,Neutral
AMD,The thing intel is doing rn is literally pat's groundwork isn't it?,Neutral
AMD,Still a tall order imo unless it's some defense chip for RAMP-C,Neutral
AMD,"If they're following industry standards I'd say it depends on how good AMD's next gen is. Intel doesn't need direct access to AMD designs to etch chips for them, and designers make way more than per wafer than foundries do.  If AMD has superior designs to intel again they could finally ship out some damn chips for laptop OEMs. It would hurt intel more than the revenue would benefit them imo since client has really been carrying intel for the last six years and demand for AMD chips has been high despite the drip feed of strix chips. honestly I'm considering an AIO/NUC/whatever the new name is with strix halo and unified LPDDR5 to upscale old footage without having to use my daily desktop. imagine if it was available at scale.",Neutral
AMD,"they don't have to make faster ram, just make it, right now, some ppl don't really care about speed",Negative
AMD,"So, risk production in late 27/early 28 and HVM in 2029 I suppose?",Neutral
AMD,YEs it is. He did make mistakes. He was hiring like crazy at the beginning of his term. And he should have started cutting sooner. But he doubled down on EUV lithography and tried to get orders in for the most advanced litho machines ASML made before TSMC started buying those machines. This is why 18A and 14A even exist at Intel.,Negative
AMD,"Nothing they're doing *right now* is a success story. Remember that they don't actually have customers, and that is first and foremost what got Gelsinger fired. As things stand, the foundry as a whole is a failure. If things turn around, that will have to be under Lip Bu.",Negative
AMD,I wasn’t aware 14A is part of the RAMP-C initiative. I thought it was only Intel 16 & 18A that are currently covered by RAMP-C?,Neutral
AMD,I think so. Maybe optimistically we see a 14A product in late 28'.,Neutral
AMD,"> But he doubled down on EUV lithography and tried to get orders in for the most advanced litho machines ASML made before TSMC started buying those machines. This is why 18A and 14A even exist at Intel.  No, that was just more wasted money. 18A doesn't even use the high-NA machines Intel bragged so much about.

AMD,get out of here with your sensable comments. we only circle jerk on this sub,Negative
AMD,It can expand in future ? My point is how can we believe such stuff at face value without actual proof.,Neutral
AMD,14A does use the High-NA machines. They didn't buy them with no plan to use them That would be stupid.,Negative
AMD,"no it wasnt. GPU's are surpassing cpu's eventually if not now.  a major part of amds success  was buying radeon all those years ago. when intel realized how utterly shortsighted they had been, they pushed arc heavy even though it wasnt going to succeed that well.  this was the right choice, as otherwise they would look like a dinosaur.",Neutral
AMD,"It can expand in the future but this is a trial, it’s not yet a long term commitment until the outcome of the project is known (final evaluation won’t be until 2026/2027). 14A is not part of RAMP-C, it’s still in phase III trial with 18A. There’s been no additional RAMP-C design calls via NSTXL that I’m aware of",Neutral
AMD,"> 14A does use the High-NA machines. They didn't buy them with no plan to use them  They bought the very first high-NA machines, claiming it was for 18A. Now they won't be used until a node that hits volume in '28/'29, by which point TSMC will have (or rather, already has) much better machines. So what exactly was the point?  > That would be stupid.  Is that not a perfectly apt description for Intel's foundry strategy in recent years? It sounds like they really drunk the coolaid with their attempts to blame the 10nm failures on the lack of EUV.",Negative
AMD,Yeah. The real mistake was LBT and the other Intel board members nerfing the r&d budget.,Negative
AMD,14A will have volume production in 2027.,Neutral

AMD,I just wanted arc to succeed 😔,Negative
AMD,did you buy one? I have owned two. A A750 and now a B580. They are great cards for the price paid. I'd like to upgrade to a B60 PRO. 24GB VRAM sounds amazing especially for $600. but I can't find one in stock anywhere.,Positive
AMD,"The fact 890M is that much faster than 140V shows this benchmark is terrible anyway. In real gaming performance, 140V performs very close to 890M and does so at usually superior efficiency.",Negative
AMD,Is panther lake on the intel process considered better perf than lunar lake on tsmc process? Or is it lateral,Neutral
AMD,I hope it comes to desktop CPUs,Positive
AMD,Almost 7600m performance ie stream machine. From a igpu . Hoping a handheld with this igpu under 1000usd,Positive
AMD,"yeah it says   ""We should also make it clear that these benchmarks seem to undermine the performance of Intel's Xe2 architecture. The Arc 140V is shown much slower than the Radeon 890M, but in reality, it ends up close to or faster in actual games.

AMD,Yeah this headline doesn't add up based on my own testing,Negative
AMD,Yeah that's a strange result. Makes me think the 16% will be for PL improvement over LL.,Negative
AMD,"So imagine how much faster it is in actual practice.  These iGPUs Intel are putting out are great, it's a good time for lower-power handhelds!  And insane power handhelds too, with Strix Halo getting in them, the Ryzen 388 (8c16t with 40CU iGPU) allegedly coming, and I'm sure Intel is working on an answer to Strix Halo which if it uses this kind of uArch, will probably be deadly.  Good friggin times.",Positive
AMD,concur  some benchmarks are biased,Negative
AMD,lateral,Neutral
AMD,If it’s just “16% faster than 890m” it’s nowhere close to 7600m. You have to be over twice as fast as the 890m.,Negative
AMD,"Isn't 140T also faster than 140V in benchmarks, despite being Xe+?",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah the 388 makes a lot of sense, a worthy sacrifice of a cpu tile for cheaper more efficient gaming cpu.",Positive
AMD,Answer to strix halo was the partnership with nvidia,Neutral
AMD,Did is you see the link? Passmark graphics score? 10999 for 7600m and 9500 for b390.,Neutral
AMD,"since the 140T has 20 watts for the GPU itself, how can it be otherwise?",Neutral
AMD,"I feel like the partnership was an answer to a much broader question concerning both companies, none of it really being an implicit answer to Strix Halo beyond a vague promise to develop custom chips with Intel cores and RTX cores fuse together using nvlink.     I mean, if they actually launch something, cool. But as of now, we don't really have any information that directly points to a competing product.      In fact, I might be crazy but I feel like it is more likely that the actual answer to Strix Halo will be all Intel silicon, because Nvidia is very horny for all things ai and all things datacenter.",Neutral
AMD,"I mean no offense, but Passmark is irrelevant.  Even comparing the 890m to the 7600m (non-xt), the 7600m is usually twice as fast, with dips down to ~60% faster, and lifts up to ~170% faster.     NoteBookCheck has an extremely robust dataset of benchmarks in games for both the 890m and the 7600m (non-xt) at various resolutions, and they show not only a clear winner, but a very large difference in the performance of these devices.      Now I'm not trashing what the B390 will be, because we need an iGPU fight here.  But thinking that the 7600m (non-xt) is only ~15.7% faster than the B390 ((new-old)/old gives percent change) because of Passmark is erroneous.",Neutral
AMD,">I feel like the partnership was an answer to a much broader question concerning both companies, none of it really being an implicit answer to Strix Halo beyond a vague promise to develop custom chips with Intel cores and RTX cores fuse together using nvlink.

AMD,"The most important characteristics of a laptop are battery life ( power efficiency) and screen quality. That is what sells ( non apple ) clamshells.    All the other crap they test in various reviews are mostly meaningless to the actual user. There is a very small %age of the market for high power/perf laptops and even smaller market for gaming.   Most of the reason a laptop is “slow” is bloatware and has nothing to do with the cpu choice anyway.  And Intel is already “beating” AMD in laptop cpu sales, by a substantial margin. People incorrectly assume AMD has most of the market share in all segments because of the very noisy and super-biased gaming reviewers, who mostly focus on $3000+ gaming desktop builds. Yes AMD is handily winning there.",Neutral
AMD,"I have a T14s Gen 5 Core Ultra 5 135U and recently I saw \~9h of battery life, browsing websites. It's quite nice piece of hardware so with Lunar Lake it would be just perfect. Of course not for heavy workload because for this we will have Panther Lake. I work in tech for years, not an expert in laptops area but I can assure you that new CPUs from Intel that I mentioned earlier are way, way, way better than previous generations.",Positive
AMD,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works. It's like the 2001 Toyota of the laptop world, it's not winning prizes for looks, but it'll never die, gets good mileage (battery life), and is easily repairable. Maybe not the laptop you want, but definitely the one you need (excluding people who need something like a dedicated GPU or really need super high CPU performance).",Positive

AMD,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good.

AMD,"if you think you're 100% correct - go out and buy an x3d and run the tests, post a video with the results, and put an amazon affiliate link in the comments for a 14700k build that overall is better than an x3d.  there's nothing wrong with the 14700k, it's a beast. i think there's a few select games where it even beats the 7800x3d. but there's a reason that you can find hundreds of youtube channels with sub counts up and down the spectrum from 0 subs to 10M subs showing hardware side by sides with the x3d's beating the 14700k - and most of them don't have advertisers to please.  in my opinion, you're getting downvoted because you don't want to provide proof, you're out here saying it's tech tubers fault that you have no proof. you can also find a good amount of open source benchmark data at openbenchmarking.org, it's not pretty - but there's useful data there as well.  but hey - you're only hurting yourself by not breaking open the youtube techfluencer conspiracy around AMD processors. go buy an x3d, do all the testing, and use it as a springboard to free us from the lies of big tech. i'd love for you to be correct, but until you can provide proof, it honestly just looks like you have buyers remorse with your 14700k.",Neutral

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance. I’ve shown full system specs and game settings every time, and provided more evidence than any tech site or tech YouTuber ever has, yet some people are still in denial.

AMD,"Arrow Lake performs quite well at general compute and power efficiency compared to prior generatons ans even against AMD.  Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU. Ironically the 9070 performance was identical with a 9700X and a 9800X3D.  So it's actually kind of the reverse, gaming reviewers painted Arrow Lake in the worst possible light.",Neutral

In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all.

(So going to be worse than windows or Linux)   All the numbers except the 7900 are with the same ssd, psu, custom water loop.  The motherboard and cpu changed between Intel builds and the 3950x was the previous build before the 14700k.   The e core performance significantly improved in arrow lake.  It’s now keeping up with 16 core am4 parts in the worst possible scenario for it.  If the scheduler was smarter, I think it would be very close to the 7900.   In windows, it’s pretty close in games I play on frame rate to the old chip. A few are actually faster.",Neutral

Well, you need a new board. So it depends what “cheaper” is seen as.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep. We all see the patterns here. Gamers nexus, HUB, LTT and most big name they all keep mocking Intel, even when Intel did good job to bring improvements to their products like fixing Arrow Lake gaming performance but those ""tech reviewer"" decided to be blind, they don't even want to revisit Intel chip and benchmark it, they don't even want to educate their viewers.    At the same time they keep overhyping Amd products to the moon like they own the stock, it's obvious now who is the real reviewer and who is fraud reviewer using their own popularity and big headline to spread their propaganda for their own benefits.

You can say that all you want but there's a reason why in the diy market everyone is buying amd over intel. People know arrow lake is doa where as am5 actually has a future, which is why everyone is flocking to the 9800x3d in droves.  Zen 7 is rumored to be on am5 as well. Meaning that am6 would come out in 2030/2031. If that's true am5 lived for around 8/9 years.  That's insane value to get out of one socket.",Positive

Most tend to skimp, only to end up buying another middling CPU the following year, and then again after that. And so the cycle trundles on.  When I buy PC parts, I usually go for the best available. Provided the price is reasonably sane. I picked up a 9900K seven years ago and it’s still holding its own. Is it on par with the 9800X3D? Of course not. But it’s still a very capable bit of kit.

AMD,"Hi all,  I ordered a contact frame from Thermal Grizzly because the temperature of my CPU wasn’t great, and I was tired of the fan noise.   I installed the contact frame in August, and everything was fine until two weeks ago, when the desktop suddenly stopped booting. The fans were spinning, but there was no POST, no debug LED — nothing. I thought the motherboard was dead.   However, when I removed the AIO head and tried to boot again, it worked!  Since then, I’ve been experiencing intermittent no-POST issues, especially after gaming sessions.   To get it to boot, I always have to adjust the screws on the AIO head. If it’s too tight: no POST. If it’s too loose: CPU temperatures are high. For example, in Hogwarts Legacy, I get around 60 FPS with an RTX 4090, while the CPU runs at around 18% usage @ 85°C. Which is not normal at all, as I used to run the game at around 100–110 FPS.  I tightened the screws on the contact frame using my thumb and index fingers.   I’m looking for advice from anyone who has encountered a similar issue, because at this point my only idea is to remove the contact frame and reinstall the original one.

I've been trying to run Avatar Frontiers of Pandora on my arc b580 for over a year now, and I keep having the same extremely unusual crash.  If I freshly reinstall the game, or change my operating system, or switch arc driver version, I can play the game normally, at regular framerates, with no issues, for around an hour. MAYBE two if I'm lucky.   The game then crashes, with seemingly no trigger. No thermal issues, no unusual resource usage, no memory leak, no framerate issues, no stuttering, not even a crash report. The game will just close as if I had closed it manually.   I don't crash in the same location every time, it crashes with different game settings, xess enabled/disabled, different monitors, different ram configurations. I can have the framerate capped or uncapped. GPU maxed out or not, power draw high or low. I can't consistently recreate the crash in the same way every time. The only certainty is that it WILL crash eventually.  After crashing once, It will then crash on game launch, every single time. The game opens, the epilepsy warning flashes up for a second or two, and then the game crashes in the same way, with no freeze, no crash report, just the game closing.  Since the game runs fine for an hour or so after I first install it, any benchmarker testing the gpu will likely never see the crash, because they install the game, run benchmarks, do their tests, and then close it before seeing anything wrong.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and have NOT worked.  * Updating graphics drivers (to both the latest absolute driver, and latest WHQL certified driver). * Downgrading graphics drivers (going all the way back to the first game ready drivers for the b580). * Updating windows (latest windows 10 and latest windows 11 versions). * Running a memory diagnostic * Enabling/disabling XMP. * Verifying integrity of game files. * Forcing the game to run in the Vulkan engine instead of snowdrop. * Performing a complete reinstall of the game. * Replacing one of the .dll files with a ""repaired"" one. (this apparently fixed a crash for some people). * Forcing the game to boot in dx11 instead of dx12.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and HAVE worked.  * Running the game on my AMD integrated graphics.  Obviously running the game on an igpu doesn't offer playable performance, but the game will run, and I've yet to find any crash, even leaving the game open for several hours.

Other times, the system may run normally for days before the issue reappears.  No relevant error logs are generated at the time of the freezes. Event Viewer only shows Kernel Power events related to the forced shutdown.  So far I've tried all possible solutions to resolve my issue:  \- Updated motherboard BIOS to the latest available version  \- Updated Windows 11 fully and also reinstalled Windows 11 through USB  \- Performed clean GPU driver reinstallations  \- Verified CPU and GPU temperatures (normal under load)  \- Ran hardware stress tests and diagnostics (CPU, GPU, memory, storage) and no failures detected  \- Tested each monitor individually (dual monitor setup)  \- Swapped HDMI/DisplayPort cables and ports  \- Tested my PC without background applications  \- Returned my PC to stock settings (no overclocks, no undervolts, no XMP changes beyond default)  I've also took my pc to a local repair shop, which they could not reproduce the issue but suggested it may be CPU or PSU related issue. However, when I took my PC to Micro Center, technicians ran similar diagnostics and stress tests but were also unable to reproduce the freezes. They have also tested the PSU voltages and it passed.

AMD,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Neutral

AMD,"u/hus1030  The mounting pressure from your AIO cooler can directly affect whether the system successfully completes POST. When the cooler is tightened too much, it can cause the CPU or motherboard to bend slightly, which may lead to poor or lost contact between the CPU and the socket pins. This prevents the processor from initializing properly, resulting in a no-POST condition. Installing a contact frame changes the pressure distribution compared to the stock retention mechanism, so overtightening the AIO screws can amplify this issue. On the other hand, if the screws are too loose, the CPU temperatures will rise because the cooler is not making proper thermal contact. To avoid these problems, ensure the AIO screws are tightened evenly in a cross pattern and do not exceed the manufacturer’s torque specifications. If the issue persists, you may need to verify that the contact frame is correctly installed or temporarily revert to the original retention bracket to rule out pressure-related problems.",Neutral

AMD,"u/Any_Information429 Your HP EliteBook 830 G8 is experiencing boot issues due to corrupted Intel Management Engine (ME) firmware, which is a critical low-level system component that manages hardware initialization. This corruption is causing the blinking caps lock light, multiple restart attempts before successful boot, and the extended Windows startup times you've been experiencing. The BIOS showing ""ME Firmware Mode: Recovery Mode"" confirms this diagnosis. Since these issues began after your recent repair, it's likely that the Management Engine chip connections were disturbed or the firmware became corrupted during the service process.  To resolve this, you need to perform a forced recovery of the ME firmware by downloading the specific firmware version for your EliteBook model from HP's support website-[HP EliteBook 830 G8 Notebook PC Software and Driver Downloads | HP® Support](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/hp-elitebook-830-g8-notebook-pc/38216726) and using specialized recovery tools to reflash the Management Engine. You also have check BIOS settings to ensure proper ME configuration and temporarily disable fast boot to allow complete initialization. If the firmware recovery doesn't resolve the issue, this may indicate hardware-level damage to the ME controller that occurred during the previous repair, which would require professional chip-level service or potentially warranty coverage since the problem originated after authorized service work. The good news is that once the ME firmware is properly restored, your system should return to normal boot times and eliminate the restart cycles you're currently experiencing.  USB flash recovery method is definitely worth trying first - it's designed specifically for these types of firmware corruption issues and should get your laptop back to normal boot times without all those frustrating restarts.

That error code you're seeing (0x00020001) is actually what's called a ""hypervisor error,"" which basically means it's a problem with Windows' virtualization stuff rather than directly being caused by your WiFi drivers.  The real culprits are more likely things like memory issues, BIOS problems, or conflicts with virtualization features like Hyper-V.

AMD,"u/strumpystrudel So what you're experiencing is actually pretty normal behavior for your laptop when it's unplugged - that 80% performance drop is totally expected and here's why. When your laptop is plugged into the wall, your CPU can run at much higher power levels (probably around 28W or more), but when you switch to battery, it gets severely limited to maybe 8-15W to preserve battery life. This is especially true for ultrabooks like the Gram that prioritize being thin and light over raw performance. The thing is, a lot of this power management happens at the hardware level with Intel's built-in systems, which is why all those Windows power settings you tweaked aren't really making a difference - the CPU is basically ignoring them and doing its own thing to save battery.  Now, for a game like Final Fantasy XI, you should still be able to get it running decently on battery with some tweaks, but expecting that same smooth 60 FPS at max settings is probably unrealistic given the fundamental power constraints of ultrabook design. Most ultrabooks see this kind of 60-80% performance hit on battery for any sustained workload, so you're definitely not alone in this.   But honestly, this is just how these thin and light laptops are designed to work - they're amazing when plugged in, but they have to make compromises when running on battery to actually give you decent battery life.",Neutral

TME is a security feature that encrypts the entire system memory using AES encryption with a hardware-generated key. The i7-12700F is part of Intel's 12th generation Alder Lake family, which includes TME support as a standard security feature.  However, TME functionality requires both processor support and proper system configuration:  Verification methods:  * BIOS/UEFI security settings * System diagnostic tools that enumerate processor security features  Important considerations: TME enablement depends on the motherboard BIOS implementation and may be disabled by default on many systems.  To assist you further, I need the following information:  * Make and model of your motherboard, as the TME feature may be disabled in the BIOS settings  For your reference, please find the official documentation: 12th Generation Intel® Core™ Processors Datasheet, Volume 1 of 2  [655258](https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/655258) (Page 40) - This document contains the specific technical details about TME support for your processor.  Once you provide your motherboard information, I can guide you on how to check and potentially enable TME in your system's BIOS settings.  Please let me know if you have any additional questions.",Positive
AMD,My motherboard is Asrock H670-M Pro RS. firmware version: 18.01,Neutral
AMD,Hello. I want to tell you i7-12700f does NOT support TME. Thank you for your help anyway.,Negative
AMD,"Your Intel i7-12700F processor does support TME (Total Memory Encryption), but the issue lies with your motherboard implementation rather than CPU capability. The ASRock H670M Pro RS with firmware 18.01 appears to either disable TME at the platform level or doesn't expose the necessary BIOS controls for consumer users. This explains why your diagnostic tools show ""TME = false"" and why HWiNFO64 displays it in gray. While you could check for TME-related options in your BIOS under Advanced → CPU Configuration or Security sections, consumer-grade H670 motherboards often omit these enterprise security features from their interfaces. Your best course of action is to contact ASRock technical support directly, providing your exact motherboard model, BIOS version, and specifically asking about TME support and whether future firmware updates might include these controls.",Neutral
AMD,"Most commenters are wrong or didn’t read all the articles. Nvidia wants some custom SKUs of server chips to pair with its data center GPUs, and Intel wanted a better solution for pc parts for the GPU tiles.   NVIDIA is NOT getting an x86 license, nor do they want one. In case you haven’t noticed, Nvidia is a $4T company largely on sales of data center GPUs, sales of which were 10x the gaming segment. Profit/earnings ratio of data center is even higher than the 10x.   In my opinion, the only reason for Intel to use RTX chiplets on pc parts is so they can have a few skus for mobile gaming. Lower end laptop chips would still use Xe cores.  This solves NONE of intel’s structural issues - they need, in this order  1. Major foundry customers  2. Regain server market share 3. Data center GPU offerings 4. Move all pc chiplets back to Intel nodes and start to fill up the fabs again",Neutral
AMD,An Intel + nVidia handheld would be something I would welcome just for DLSS4 alone.,Positive
AMD,"I don’t think it will change that much overall.  It’s no secret that NVIDIA wanted a x86 license for decades now and now they basically got it. This will ""hurt"" AMD by offering competition to markets where AMD currently holds a monopoly like with Strix Halo, most handhelds and consoles.  I don’t think we’ll see big changes on the Intel side.  I don’t think this will affect neither the iGPUs nor ARC because why would it.",Negative
AMD,"this jointventure is NOT about consumer gpu and does not change anythig about gaming gpu of intel, amd or nvidia.  this is instantly obvioiusly from just reading the headlines of the news announcing this.   this tumbnail is just hub using this news to suggest jet another time that maybe amd might just be screwed. they do this because they are neutral in every way.",Negative
AMD,"i think it's bad for us, consumers",Negative
AMD,Was the team up really to crush AMD or Nvidia's answer to enter China?,Neutral
AMD,AMDware unboxed only cares about AMD anyway,Neutral
AMD,This hurts the arc division way more than this could ever hurt amd.,Negative
AMD,They will crush user's wallet,Negative
AMD,you guys realize Nvidia buys all their stuff from TSMC the same company that makes all of AMD's stuff...So now intel will buy from them too since they cant compete? Because no amount of Intel+Nvidia humping is going to make a TSMC baby...you got to pay to play.,Neutral
AMD,"Even assuming they made monster co-op AMD still has own ecosystem of GPU and CPU, along with consumer support. It's Radeon and Ryzen are still very strong consumer wise. So no, AMD is not screwed",Positive
AMD,Remember Kaby Lake G? No? This will also be forgotten soon.,Negative
AMD,Yes.,Positive
AMD,Intel partners with UMC of Taiwan the third largest foundry in the world.    What does it mean for UMC and Intel?   How will it affect transfer / exchange of technology between Taiwan and Intel?   How does this affect TSMC position with USAG?,Neutral
AMD,Foveros baby!,Positive
AMD,AMDUnboxed on suicide watch.,Negative
AMD,"For mobile/laptop performance, yes AMD is in the dust, maybe? Makes sense since AMD GPU division is mainly focused on the console partnership with Sony/Microsoft--leaves the mobile platform wide open.",Neutral
AMD,"Who knows, time will tell. But if AMD does find its back against the wall, this is when it does its best. This should be interesting to say the least.",Positive
AMD,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive. I know they have a lot of tricks up their sleeves still, like designing HBM memory onto the die (how Vega was supposed to be originally) and unified memory (soldered down, see the new AI branded chips).",Negative
AMD,Ohh noooerrrrrrrrr,Negative
AMD,"Actually this may be good for AMD and I will tell you why: Open source drivers. Nvidia if they had a say in intels graphics division would make the intel GPU stuff proprietary and locked down and when support ends its gonna hurt. Meanwhile AMD has open source drivers and in the age that linux is gaining popularity will make it the preferred platform for anyone interested in the growing linux ecosystem. Nvidia will NEED to change how they handle things or intel may not be as attractive as they once were, intel has already suffered a massive knock on thier reputation and this may be the mortal wound that can work in AMD's favor.",Neutral
AMD,"I don't see how this means anything at all for AMD in desktop. This is borderline irrelevant for desktop gaming. Most users pick up an Intel or AMD CPU and an NVIDIA dGPU.  APUs don't really exist in desktop gaming.  In mobile? I think most people won't care much. Intel and AMD APUs both offer compelling and reasonable alternatives for everyday usage. Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.  In all other cases I dont see this being a compelling option.",Neutral
AMD,So either a 200w igpu with a 300w intel cpu or an intel cpu with a 5030 slapped on it?  I think amd will be fine,Neutral
AMD,welcome to the Nvidia and amd duopoly,Positive
AMD,"I’m really curious what the power efficiency ends up looking like here - mobile performance/W has continued to be very good in recent Intel platforms, and Nvidia is the market leader in that regard among gpu IHVs. But until now, Nvidia chips being intrinsically dGPUs has completely neutered any potential mobile power efficiency or handheld capability - but not anymore if such a thing can be a chiplet/tile! Interesting days ahead…",Positive
AMD,"By that time amd will have already made an FSR4 capbable handheld, so no significant change",Neutral
AMD,"It won’t affect either cause on parts that don’t need a nvidia igpu why raise the price with it when arc igpu is really good as is, maybe for the upper end they will have nvidia but what’s really stopping them from shipping one with an intel arc tile, gives customers more options and nvidia s Option may end up being more expensive",Neutral
AMD,a partnership doesnt mean they get free reign over license lol,Neutral
AMD,"AMD already has the next gen of consoles. Except for the Switch, which NVIDIA already has (with ARM, not with Intel).",Neutral
AMD,"None, It's a way for NVidia to have another product line and stop Intel from having a competitive product line.",Neutral
AMD,"Not to crush amd, but this essentially just kills arc and hurts the consumer market more. You won't be getting any of those 250 dollar 12gb gpus anymore.",Negative
AMD,Why would it?,Neutral
AMD,"It has nothing to do with the dgpu product stack. Nvidia makes very little from the diypc market. Way more comes from prebuilts, laptops and 90+% from data centers and other enterprise use. In a very real way, the arc cards are not a competitor to Nvidia.",Neutral
AMD,"Unfortunately no matter what given Intel's current state the division is going to suffer. Intel cannot afford to invest in products that will take a very long time to generate profit or may never generate profit. If even AMD cannot compete with Nvidia, then Intel will likely never be able too either",Negative
AMD,"Be civil and follow Reddiquette, uncivil language, slurs and insults will result in a ban.",Negative
AMD,Past != Future,Neutral
AMD,"nvidia also used to make motherboard chipset, with mixed success.",Neutral
AMD,FSR 4 looks like the later versions of Dlss 2 did,Neutral
AMD,"This ""insignificant change"" we definitely want though.  Competition is good in a stagnant market...",Neutral
AMD,"Other than Halo SKU which we are yet to establish any trend of, AMD notoriously drags their feet. RDNA3 will be with us for a while",Negative
AMD,Wont this be targetting the ML workstation space where you have the iGPU with access to >128GB of RAM like Strix Halo with DMA and/or NVLink banswidth?,Neutral
AMD,">maybe for the upper end they will have nvidia but what’s really stopping them from shipping one with an intel arc tile, gives customers more options and nvidia s Option may end up being more expensive  Possibly an overlap like this would be a waste of money developing, and tbh I highly doubt customers would go for the Intel option rather than a Nvidia one, *even if* the Intel option is better performing, because of Nvidia's insane mind share.",Neutral
AMD,Never said that.,Neutral
AMD,Also a way for Nvidia to invest some of their funny money (which is essentially infinite) into a cheap company. Intel under $20 was ludicrous. Intel is still at book value at $29.,Neutral
AMD,Why do so many people think that this will kill ARC?,Negative
AMD,The market for Arc is the same as for Nvidia.,Neutral
AMD,Was that back in the MacBooks having the NVIDIA 9400m paired with a Core2Duo? Those were solid.,Positive
AMD,"No, but it is a reminder on shortcomings to watch out for. The Intel + AMD Partnership with the Intel NUCs several years ago made for some pretty compelling hardware. I still have a NUC8i7HVK in service which works like a champ.  If we are talking about current day NVIDIA with their Discrete Graphics (not the MX budget crap) then their GPUs are obviously smoking anything AMD and Intel. That doesn't resolve some of the Linux problems that still remain with NVIDIA, and that's not going to stop some of the BS NVIDIA does with their hardware around NVENC/NVDEC stream limits. But they have raised those limits, and the open NVIDIA drivers are getting better in time.",Positive
AMD,"Yup. Their nForce boards were great for overclocking, but rather buggy too.",Negative
AMD,"It's not a later version of dlss 2, it's between dlss 3 and 4. Just go watch some videos comparing both.   And btw redstone is coming probably at the end of this year which will improve ray tracing quality and frame gen performance.",Neutral
AMD,"No reputable reviewer thinks that. Most I've seen say it's better than DLSS 3, and very slightly behind DLSS 4.  Why lie about this?",Negative
AMD,They literally haven't said a word about it everyone's just speculating off of Moore's laws anti Intel videos lol consumer is the last thing they care for atm and might be server first cause that makes the most financial sense,Negative
AMD,If they do that in the case the two companies deal fall apart Intel is screwed with no graphics to compete with even the basic amd ones,Negative
AMD,"Well phrased, They now have a seat at the table of Intel to sway votes enough to dissuade them from making competitive products",Neutral
AMD,"Too many people are peeping that MLID podcast. Dude there is very confrontative about his theory that ARC is being ""effectively"" canceled because of some very early roadmap not paying out. Everything is a confirmation bias at this point.   I on the other hand don't get why would Intel forfeit it's competitive advantage with GPU accelerated AI, XeSS or QuickSync and made itself dependant on nVidia. Doesn't make sense especially now, when they have significant influx of cash from both Nvidia and government.",Negative
AMD,"Arc was already not doing well long before. Pouring millions into their gpu division every year with no returns. Their own road maps had their gpus coming out a year sooner but everything got delayed with them resizing the company. Like this deal is not exactly what killed arc, but arc was already struggling beforehand so this was most likely the nail in the coffin.",Negative
AMD,Nvidia does not have an A310 competitor.,Neutral
AMD,But I still remember how many motherboards with Nvidia chipsets I replaced way back.  They used to reliably overheat and need a reflow.  I think it was the HP DV6000 and DV9000 series.,Neutral
AMD,I have not lied,Neutral
AMD,"While workstations dont directly contribute a big chunk of the sales, I suspect they dont want to yield their foothold on the ML/Data Science guys.  If they start getting familiar with non-nVIDIA ecosystems, it could mean indirect losses when these guys start procuring non-nVIDIA dGPUs in servers when they do port their workstation experiments to ""larger"" hardware now that AI is all the rage.  B60 is gaining momentum on homelabs, and Strix Halo to some extent getting popular for those needing more memory for their larger datasets.",Neutral
AMD,"MLID has used clickbait trash thumbnails/titles way too many times, no one should watch that garbage channel to begin with.",Negative
AMD,"I think Intel priced in multiple generations of taking losses when they decided to enter the GPU market. Essentially impossible to walk in to a mature duopoly market and immediately start turning profit as a new player, even with Intel's resources.  Of course I think they also had much rosier projections for their other ventures when they started this journey, so who knows if the GPU losses are still tolerable.",Negative
AMD,Intel doesn't have a current gen A310 competitor either.,Neutral
AMD,Theres no way that nvidia is gonna let intel keep producing entry level gpus that directly compete with their own. I know their deals are in regards to apus and to compete with strix halo but nvidia is not gonna invest into a company with a competitor to their gpus. Like a b580 destroys the 5060 and 5050 while costing less or the same amount. There's no way nvidia invests 5 billion without some agreement that kills off arc as long as they are together.,Negative
AMD,Their nForce boards were excellent for overclocking and tinkering! That's for sure. I also remember them being a bit buggy lol.,Positive
AMD,IIRC that wss the AMD Turion X2 + NVIDIA 7300Go laptops. Those were notorious for dying.   I also remember some budget laptops with the Turion X2 + ATi 3200 chopsrt graphics would die due to graphics desoldering off the board. The GPU would sit at the end of the heatsink and burn up.   The 9400M MacBooks I remember would get hot enough to start leaving powder from the chassis on my desk lol.,Negative
AMD,"You did tho. It doesn't look like ""later versions of DLSS 2"". Every reputable source has said it's better than DLSS 3 and close to DLSS 4",Positive
AMD,"They're already at 2, going on 3, generations of losses though (Intel discrete GPU's basically have 0 marketshare, even worse than AMD who are also doing really badly) so even if that were true that isn't a reason to be optimistic.  As a company they also seem to be desperate to get income as well and so there is no reason to assume they're going to tolerate that situation for all that much longer.    I doubt they'll entirely kill off their GPU division, they can still do iGPU's which will be good enough and cheaper than paying NV a royalty, but the discrete GPU line is clearly in trouble.",Negative
AMD,A310 is cheap enough and good enough for it's purpose. If it ain't broke why fix it,Neutral
AMD,"Wrong man. You just don’t understand how small the diypc market is compared to prebuilts, laptops, and enterprise- it’s a fraction of one percent.",Negative
AMD,The later versions of Dlss 2 look like Dlss 3,Neutral
AMD,Nvidia probably feels the same about their low end SKUs.,Neutral
AMD,"The DIYPC market largely drives the “prebuilt” market, with a 1-3 generation lag.  Many people who buy “prebuilts” have people they go to for advice (i.e. they talk to their friends/family members who DIY). When there’s a big swing in the DIY market, it typically ripples out to the prebuilt market over a few years/generations.",Neutral
AMD,"Lol, what an explanation hahahaha   And that's still not ""better than DLSS 3"" as most say",Negative
AMD,Yeah lol,Positive
AMD,AMD Unboxed say anything about that? What about Linus Cheap Tips!,Neutral
AMD,"""Everyone I don't like is biased""-ass answer",Negative
