Intel,"3050 performance at half the power, can't argue with that.  I do wonder how long it will be before the low-end dGPU disappears entirely from laptops, suspect these new chips probably aint it due to price but it's presumably coming.",Neutral
Intel,"While Geekbench's OpenCL isnt super popular for GPU testing;  I still cant believe a mainstream integrated GPU is actually competing with laptop 3050Ti, and these results still aren't with final optimizations!  by the time Panther Lake comes out, Intel claiming that its as fast as laptop RTX 4050 might actually be true lol",Negative
Intel,Are these better than Ryzen igpu? How do they compare to RTX 4050 AND 5050 in non demanding game?,Neutral
Intel,"I'm excited sure but if the claims are true how can anyone here expected these to be reasonably priced and sell well? If it competes with a laptop dedicated GPU it will be priced 2-3 times that laptop. The 285H isn't even that popular and its expensive, hope the 385H is affordable AND the claims are true.",Neutral
Intel,"The score is slightly above a GTX 1650 Super which in turn is slightly above a GTX 1060 which is barely matched by current most performing 128 bits iGPU (Lunar Lake / Strix Point)  Even if we expect 50% improvement compared to 890M, that's still half the performance level of a full power mobile RTX 3060.

Intel,"It'll happen eventually but they have a few issues.  First is memory bandwidth, they'd need to put a wider bus on it to address which is costly.  Second is the memory itself, they need something with higher bandwidth (but that might be addressed with LPDDR6).  To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.  Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.  A think that in 2028 big APU solutions can compete well against XX50 series and most XX60 cards.  It isn't happening before then however.",Negative
Intel,Apple's M5 already beats the 3050Ti though.,Neutral

Intel,PTL should have comparable or possibly even lower production costs than ARL. There's some room for optimism.,Neutral
Intel,this GPU is also coming into the 355H btw (more specifically there's a Ultra X7 version of the 355H with the full 12-core GPU)     and iirc last time the 255H was pretty popular,Neutral
Intel,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.  EDIT: 8060S (Strix Halo) is \~18,000 for reference.  EDIT 2: 890M (strix point's top end) about 8,100, so the PTL 12Xe chip will smoke that.  I'm excited about it, it looks like a great chip!",Neutral

Intel,"Only sticking point seems to be cost I suppose, implementing a truly competitive iGPU looks like it will be expensive if Strix Halo is anything to go by.

Bang for buck AT HIGHER RESOLUTIONS — that’s where it’s at. And I’ve had 4090 (sold), amd 9070(sold). Never would I pay what they are asking for a 5090.

Blurs my picture even on best settings possible.",Positive
Intel,Upselling,Neutral
Intel,IMO it's probably not economical for them to do it.   Gaming laptops/handhelds are already niche enough as it is -- doesn't make sense for them to package both and for OEMs to carry both for just for a ~$1-200 delta between the units. Those who want the full GPU will just pay for it.,Negative
Intel,"You gotta remember these CPU’s don’t have multi-threading. AMD gets 16 threads out of their 8 core z1 and z2 extreme but with these core ultra’s you get one core and that’s it. A full on physical core is better than a virtual core, but the same amount of cores with multi-threading is much better than just a same core-count CPU without it. Intel are offering up to 16 cores which is 16 cores/16 threads, but generally should offer better multi-core performance vs an 8-core 16-thread. If anything it’s nice Intel have the ability to improve core count offerings without significantly raising the power requirements.   I for one veered away from the MSI Claw 8 AI+ as a standalone PC solution because it lacked the multi-core performance I needed with it only having 8 physical cores and no multi-threading. A 16-core offering is exactly what I need.",Neutral

Intel,"If anything, seems strictly worse than N3, even compared to older iterations. That's not great for a node that was supposed to go toe to toe with N2. Especially if the production cost is more in line with the latter.",Negative
Intel,"18a is initially launching with its lower power variant, which is why the only nova cpus that will use it for the compute tile are the laptop ones. The higher power variant comes later",Neutral
Intel,"Jaykihn, whose tweets these leaks are based on, says that the design characteristics cannot be extrapolated to the node itself.   So it is less likely that the clocks are limited by 18A. It is just what was decided for this particular product.",Neutral
Intel,"> […] It doesn't seem like it improved on N3 and I know that they were targeting better frequency and lower power than they got.  Well, we already had rumors of Intel struggling to hit actual intended frequency-goals, no?  Though especially the actual performance-metrics of the node will be quite sobering I think.  The power-draw of these SKUs is supposed to be a TDP of *officially* 25W – In reality, these parts are allowed to draw as much as 55W (2+0+4 or 4+0+4) and 65/80W (4+4+4 and 4+8+4) respectively.  So it must be seen, if these parts are any more efficient in daily usage, or just a side-grade to Lunar Lake.",Negative
Intel,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power. A 10-15% frequency advantage would go a long, long way towards closing gaps if it comes as a relatively small power cost.",Neutral

Intel,Laptop.,Neutral
Intel,Since when is any user determining what cores they want to use and when?,Neutral
Intel,It makes sense to have three as the low-power cores prioritize keeping the power consumption low for battery life but to achieve this they aren't attached to the ring bus which hurts performance so 8 regular E cores are also used,Neutral
Intel,">I can't say I'm entirely sold on the idea of having three core clusters humming inside my laptop.  From a user's perspective, CPU's are a blackbox and the inner-working details are irrelevant. What matters is results. They want, typically, a balance of performance, battery life, heat / fan noise, and cost, placing greater emphasis on one of these categories over the others.  The idea is that P cores = performance optizied  E cores = Area optimized  LP-E Cores = power optimized.  The theory being to have different core types focus on different parts of PPA.  E cores and LP-E cores are the same microarchitecture. Just LP-E cores are off-ring so the ring (and rest of the cores) can be powered down in light-load scenarios.  Intel's biggest problem is that looking at each of the cores, the P cores perform their designated role the worst. 200% larger than E cores for \~10% more IPC and \~15% more clockspeed is a pretty rough trade off - and by the time you've loaded all P cores and need to load E cores too, that clockspeed difference diminishes hard.  Intel's better off (and all rumors point this way) to growing the E cores slightly and making that architecture the basis of the new P and E cores (like Zen vs Zen-C)",Neutral

Intel,"And with all the issues Windows already has with the scheduler, I fully expect it to never be able to properly utilize the different cores.

Intel,Darkmont should really not be that far off Cougar Cove. Certainly not *slow*.,Negative
Intel,The E-Cores are plenty fast for most use-cases by now and there are 8 of them in there. Aren‘t they even ahead of the skylake IPC by now? 8 will be doing a great deal with a good clock frequency.  Only the 4 LP-Cores are kind of weak. But they aren‘t attached to the ring-bus and really only used for offloading low req Backgroundtasks and an idling machine. So that you can turn off the faster cores when they aren‘t necessary.  But for performant gaming and productivity it is basically a 12 core machine.,Positive
Intel,I hope there's a 4+0+4+12 for handhelds but they might not consider adding a whole new tile configuration packaging line worth it over just giving the OEM a discount.,Negative

Intel,"> Not great, not terrible.

Intel,"> BSPD and transistor density is flattening the VF curve on the high-end   He doesn't make this claim. BSPD in particular was supposed to help the most at high voltage, and the density does not appear to meaningfully differ from N3, which it still regresses relative to.    Best case scenario, the node, for other reasons, can't hit as high voltages as N3, and the top of the curve is just capped. But you wouldn't expect thermals to be such an issue then.    Doesn't seem to be any evidence of the core-level VF curve benefiting from the node either.",Neutral
Intel,"Jaykihn attributes only density to the supposed heat issues, not BSPD. Which makes sense because the process guy and Stephen Robinson both talked about having to space out the signal and power wires when working with BSPD.  If they prioritized density, then it is possible that frequency could not reach the theoretical maximum due to crosstalk or heat issues.",Neutral
Intel,"18A has always been low density, but expected to compensate for it with very efficient frequency scaling past peak perf/W. It was always going to struggle in laptops, where you rarely push past the best perf/W due to thermal and battery constraints.  Wait for the desktop/server chips before you call it. With fewer thermal constraints and much higher power budgets, they should be able to push well past the perf/W peak, where it should continue to scale well and for a long time before it starts hitting severely diminishing returns.  I'm not talking 300W monster CPUs, but the scaling between a 65W and 105W 18A CPU should be more significant than on current nodes, where you might gain like 10-15% additional performance from that 50% power bump. I'd expect 65W to 105W on 18A to yield 20-25% due to the benefits of BPD.",Neutral

Intel,"I actually suspect otherwise - speculation on my part, but I suspect that they were running into unexpected process issues when they pumped the frequency and/or voltage higher so they had to scale back performance.  It almost feels like a process bug that they discovered when making the actual chips.  They've also talked about kind of weak yields on 18A on their latest earnings call.  That makes me optimistic about the improvement opportunity in a more mature 18A if they can chase down these issues, and perhaps even more in 18AP if they can clean up these bugs.  If they have a 'double upgrade' opportunity in both fixing the discovered 18A issues and implementing the originally planned 18AP improvements then it could end up being a somewhat bigger jump.  Don't think it'll be an N2 beater though.  18AP *might* beat the best of N3 in some applications, we'll see.  For that you'd want to look ahead to 14A where the CFO mentioned on the earnings call (and he was somewhat realistic in other areas so it's more believable here) that 14A has been a positive surprise and they're actually pretty excited about it.  It's possible that if Intel gets more experience on High-NA versus TSMC that they might start having an edge later on.  Maybe.",Neutral
Intel,"> Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD   And yet we see the exact opposite here.

Intel,"Yeah after being reminded that the LPE cores are also Darkmont like the E-Cores I looked up the layout in detail and the differences is simply the P and E cores are on a large Cluster with L3 Cache and a fast ring-bus, but the LPE cores are seperated from that Ring-bus and don't have any L3 Cache (just access to a ""memory side-cache"" accessible by the NPU and small cluster but not the large cluster).     They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them. The small cluster could be used to offload background tasks to themselves (if the powerlimits aren't hit), which could at least improve 1% lows and fps stability.",Neutral

That only suddenly changed by 2017–2019, when Intel suddenly increased core-count in mobile swiftly from Quad- to Hexa- and ultimately Octa-cores, while pushing the TDP in quick succession  into insane territory.  *That was the time, Asus took about a year to manage applying liquid-metal en masse, for Intel-notebooks!*  You are right with your sample here, yet you only confirm what I said before. Only past quad-cores it was.",Neutral
Intel,"> The idea is that because LP-E cores are off ring, you can power gate the rest of the cores when you're doing light tasks, getting much better battery life.  Do you happen to know, if that (ring-bus related) was the same principle on MTL?  > The failure of MTL/ARL's LP-E cores was that there was only 2 and they were very weak, so in practice, even a single web page would turn the ring back on and move the process back to the main cores, **negating the entire point of them**.  Yeah, talking about throwing some completely untested sh!t onto the market, irregardless of the fact, if the product makes sense or not — A true classic, I'd say. Just Intel being Intel.  Since dropping those LPE-cores on MTL, would've actually made the mask and thus needed die-space *smaller*, which in turn would've actually *increased* their yields \*and\* in return profit-margins already …  But muh, benchmark bars and ""AMD has moar corez!!"", I guess.  > LNL/PTL/NVL have much more powerful LP-E cores, 4 of them instead of 2, so common tasks can stay entirely within the LP island, and they're on the same compute tile, so they're also used in full nT workloads.

In others words they want Panther Lake to ride on the momentum and positive vibes the B series branding has garnered.   Xe³ is a Xe³ based architecture like Xe³P is architecturally but there is more to selling a product than the engineering, keep in mind there's strong rumors that there will be a B770 launch, Intel also just released the B60 and later this year will provide a big software expansion to Bxx cards so the B series brand is still full of life. Xe³P will launch much later and at that point Intel feels there will have passed enough time to leave the B series branding behind.",Neutral

Intel,"They would be extremely stupid not to continue to release discrete graphics cards, even if they decide to release 2-3 gaming SKUs per new generation; entry/budget, mid-range, high-end, etc.  - they win. until they keep iterating up, maturing driver, increasing install user base, improving software, until the point they can target higher segments (enthusiast tier)  Gaming GPUs remain the flagship component that pushes the limits of silicon design, features like ray tracing, AI upscaling, and real time path racing all debut in gaming before trickling into pro and AI workloads. Every research report shows that demand for high-end GPUs is still strong. Steam HW survey shows the most popular GPUs are still mid-range gaming cards, showing that discrete GPUs remain central to the PC ecosystem.  And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",Neutral

Xe3 just have additional optimizations and HW blocks along the lines of OMM (confirmed) and whatever new tech Intel decides is worth pushing for higher end parts.

Intel,"> It explicitly calls BMG dGPU cards ""discrete"" and does not do so for PTL  Of course not, since it would instantly tank their reputation and will kill all further ARC-sales?!  Do you actually think, that Intel is that stupid to plain announce the death of ARC-series graphics-cards? Do you think they'd even sell a hundreds cards after such a announcement? Who would by a dead-end line of graphics-cards, which won't even get any further driver-support and still have disastrous drivers like Intel's ARC? NO-ONE!  Of course they virtue signal it through the backdoor here, to preserve the sell-off the of the rest of pile of shame of their B-series graphics-cards as long as possible (leaving users with none support afterwards), and *only then* pull the plug afterwards when they went through their inventory …  Since when are you following Intel? Intel has always done so, and only announced a sudden discontinuation once the inventory was sold (leaving customers in the open with no further support overnight), despite virtue signalling a continuation all the time (to preserve a proper sell-off).  ---- Wasn't this exactly the same story with **Optane** back then? Each and every question upon a future support was answered in the affirmative, only to pull the plug overnight again as usual …  I'm not another piracy of cons here, it's Intel pulling the same Optane-stunt with ARC – Happily selling off their cards, knowing darn well, that they will pull the plug, yet refuse to actually play with open cards again.",Negative

Intel,"You have to look at this from both sides.  This would give NVidia the ability to offer OEMs a tightly integrated on SOC gfx solution vs a separate discrete gfx package as it is now. This would lower costs for NVidia's customers as well as improve performance and Intel's cpu's get to ride that train.   Intel has a long track record of using integrated gfx so it's certainly right up their alley to take this on.  Could Xe gfx coexist with NVidia? Yep, I think so.  Xe could be the budget igfx option and iNVidia is the premium integrated solution. That's basically how it is now with Intel Arc/Battlemage & GTX.   On the DC side, Intel has absolutely no gfx solution at this time and won't have anything for at least two years.  Intel already sells NVidia when a gfx solutions are needed so tighter integrated products will benefit both sides in that DC space as well.",Positive
Intel,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work. And even if NVIDIA wants to keep Intel's fabs open, I doubt they want to run them either.",Neutral

Intel,The b580 is still good at $250 and it’s only recently in the past month the 5060 and 9060xt 8gb dropped near or at $250 in some instances.  It’s a good card at 1440p aswell and it has 12gb of the other 2 8gb cards.

Intel,"It's a really good general purpose card. Perhaps not the best card if you want to squeeze out the most fps out of games, but it performs really well in a wide range of tasks including gaming. And yes 12GB VRAM really comes in handy.  It can easily be found for under $250. B580 is still cheaper than 5060 and 9060 XT and even RTX 5050 and RX 7600, especially in the UK where you can find a B570 for only 20 pounds more than RTX 3050. That's way cheaper than RX 6600, it's a no brainer. But the prices could only go down thanks to economy of scale mostly. It's been produced for a while, that's why.  Also one of the big reasons it's still selling now is thanks to good publicity. Imagine if it came out as the same time as RX 9060 XT. HWU would tear a new hole regardless of how much of an improvement it is over the Alchemist cards and the impressive productivity performance.

Intel,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction. Very important when running 24-48 hour simulations.",Neutral

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm more familiar with the Linux side / vGPU than VDI.  ECC is Error Correcting RAM. I generally don't understand the use case for ECC either, but it is ubiquitous in HPC. All server boards support ECC RAM.  In modern environments most of these features need 16GB of VRAM minimum, but if you ever wanted to try it on a consumer card, you could get an old RTX 20 series and try it out with some driver mods.

Calculations, it absolutely depends on what you're calculating and which bit gets flipped; flipping the low-order bit in a number might not matter much and flipping the high-order bit could cause a big error.  Networking, it depends on whether the protocols you use have more error checks at a higher level (TCP does; UDP does not).

Obviously fixed pass though is an option, but even that isn't without issue. NVIDIA only recently removed the driver restriction, they could add it back at any time.

Intel,"LMAO, I actually have quite a bit of knowledge in this area.  If all you care for is VDI for a small number of VMs, then you'd go GPU passthrough. vGPU / MxGPU often requires higher levels of hypervisor software tier (i.e. VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus), requiring more money. For KVM hosts, setting up vGPU is a lot more difficult and time consuming than just straight up GPU passthrough.  Only two groups of people would be interested in GPU virtualization / splitting:  * Enterprise, in which they wouldn't care about the used card prices.  * Enthusiasts, in which they wouldn't want to pay for vGPU prices anyway. So why bother catering to this crowd?",Neutral
Intel,"Full GPU passthrough is not a solution that many people would consider because it is clumsier than using sr-iov (or potentially VirtIO GPU Venus). Plus for each extra passthrough instance I would have to add in another GPU and this greatly increases power consumption, heat output and cooling requirements. The process is not all that much more complicated at least on Turing GPUs with a hacked driver on KVM guests at least. Plus for passthrough, you probably still need an NVIDIA card because last I checked AMD cards still had a random kernel panic issue after being passed through.  My assumption is that sr-iov on the b50 will allow users an affordable way to have multiple guests on one host GPU without increasing power draw and paying for expensive alternatives and expensive vGPU subscriptions.",Negative
Intel,"...first time I heard people prefer SRIOV over GPU passthrough because it's ""clumsier"" lol. I'm sure setting up mdev devices in KVM, finding the correct corresponding GPU instances, making them persistent through reboot, then edit virsh xml for each individual VM is a lot easier than just doing IOMMU passthrough. /s     Again, enthusiasts don't care about power consumption / heat output / cooling requirements for their lab environment. Enterprise that do care about them are very willing to pay extra cost to get a production ready driver. You're creating a hypothetical situation that simply does not exist in the real world.",Neutral

Intel,"The E core having more improvements than just 50% larger L2 is a nice surprise, but damn the efficiency and performance of it is insane. 29% and 22% more performance, at the same power draw is insane, clocking like 6.7% higher too. They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown. As that can probably handle like another extra watt of heat and performance. Battery life is very nice, the fact that it can match other phones with like over 1000mAh bigger battery is funny. As people always flexing over how they have like a 4000, 5000mAh+ battery, of course having a bigger capacity is better, but the fact that Apple is more efficient with it and can have the same battery life at a much smaller battery speaks volumes about it.",Positive
Intel,"The occupancy characteristics of A19 Pro are quite incredible. 67% occupancy for a RT workload.  Look at Chips and cheese's SER testing. 36-44% ray occupancy with SER in Cyberpunk 2077 RT Overdrive.     Assuming NVIDIA can get this working on 60 series an effective a 52-86% uplift. After OMM and SER this seems like the third ""low hanging"" RT fruit optimization. Anyone serious about a PT GPU architecture NEEDs dynamic caching like Apple. And no this is not RDNA 4's Dynamic VGPR, it's a much bigger deal. Register file directly in L1$ has unique benefits.",Neutral
Intel,"Nice been waiting for this. P-core frontend improvements and branch, and a wider E-core with it's newer memory subsystem shows great YoY gains as usual. Though I am not surprised since it's been years leading up to this that Apple has steadily have been increasing power/freq to get the rest of it's performance gains, although IPC YoY is still class leading. The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that. The base iPhone 17 looks like a reaaly reallly good option, more than ever, wished they didn't drop the Plus model. But man, I feel like waiting another year, hearing rumours about N2 and new packaging tech excites me.  That said, looking forward to QC, MT, and Samsung.

Intel,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.  Its either Qualcomm or Apple. AMD is too far behind Oryon and Apple's uarchs. They consume similar or even more area for their core architecture while lagging in performance while using significantly more power. The x86 ecosystem and compatibility is the only reason they'd survive Oryon.",Neutral
Intel,Having so many SoC makers on arm competing against each other by one upping each other yearly is bearing fruit vs x86. i don't know how Intel and AMD long term can fare at this rate. Arm CPUs are still showing double digit gains yearly.,Neutral
Intel,Most of apples RT gains are from optmsiing how the GPU deals with divergence.  This is not dedicated RT silicon so much as making the GPU be able to maintain much higher throughput when there is lots of divergence.  RT operations have a shit tone of divergence.,Negative
Intel,I can't wait to see die shots and measurements for these chips. The A18 Pro and A18 die shots were really interesting to see what was compacted or lost for the base model chip. I have a feeling that there will be bigger differences for the A19 Pro and A19 with that giant SLC on the former. Die areas will also be interesting. Cache isn't cheap for area and I'd also love to see inside the new E-cores and GPU.,Positive
Intel,">Growing the E core into a medium core is really important and something I was worried apple might miss out on, but this means they should be able to keep up in multicore as trends point to flooding CPUs with E cores.  I wouldn't say its a medium core yet tbh. Apple's E cores are still sub 1mm2 in area usage. Compared to other ""M cores"" they are still relatively small. I imagine the A19 Pro E core is fairly larger but the A18 E core was around 0.6/0.7mm2 in size. I'd imagine its not grown a whole lot.  >They really ~~buried~~ deleted the lede by not even mentioning the E core improvements beyond the cache and undersold the GPU.

So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",Neutral
Intel,"While RT does have lots of branching logic (and CPUs are much better at dealign with this) you also want to shader the result when a ray intercepts, and this is stuff GPUs are rather good at (if enough rays hit that martial)   We have had CPU RT for a long time and so long as you constrain the martial space a little GPUs these days, even with all the efficiency  loss are still better at it.   (there are still high end films that opt for final render on cpu as it gives them more flexibility in the shaders they use) but for a game were it is all about fudging it GPUs are orders of magnitude faster, you just have so much more fp compute throughput on the GPU even if it is running at 20% utilization that is still way faster than any cpu.",Positive
Intel,"Its not just useful for RT but also for a lot of other situations, being able to just call out to functions on the GPU and not pay a HUGE divergence penalty (you still pay some) opens up GPU compute to a load more cases were we currently might not bother.",Positive
Intel,I'm a bit confused. You think lagging 15% behind in P/W the competition for an entire year is not being a generation behind?  ARM themselves have managed only a 15% jump this year. So it will essentially be 2 years before we get an E core that matches the A19 pro. And this is just considering the Xiomi's SoC. Mediatek's and Qualcomm's which dominate the majority of the market lag even further behind.,Negative

If the faster LPDDR5X-9600 in the A19 Pro eats more power, it's fair to include that power because ***all*** A19 Pros will ship with LPDDR5X-9600. That was Apple's choice to upgrade to this faster memory.    Now, you're very right: we can't purely blame the uArch at Apple. It may well be the DRAM or the boost algorithms (like we saw at the A18 Pro launch last year) and—at Apple specifically—even the marketing overlords.

Intel,"While the efficiency for this is BAD, I dont think its 20W per core.  When we look at results by [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-zen4-zen4c-scaling/2) we can see \~7-8W per core for this (not great numbers, because its a weird chip and different node), which is still very bad. AMD certainly has some power issues, but many of which, i.e. inefficient I/O dies, are not really dependent on the CPU uArch and could switch at any moment. They certainly have much more inefficient chips at the moment than both Apple and Qualcomm. For Zen 6 we expect a major update to the desktop chiplet architectur which could bring some much needed improvements in terms of I/O though.  They have reasonably fast cores, and I think they are not in a terrible position, even though it is far from good. I think what is interesting for AMD to look out for is that they keep moving fast, instead of intel who didnt move fast since like 14nm, and AMD has strong cores. Additionally AMD has (including from the datacenter) an enterprise need to make the CPUs more efficient.  So yeah, very bad CPUs efficiency wise. A bit behind, but not terribly on perf per node wise, efficiency on the desktop is an afterthought for AMD, clearly, but they are moving constantly and are improving.

So what will happen first is some data will be evicted from cache and those bits will be used as registers.   maybe that shader has a typical width of just 5 registers and only in some strange edge case goes all the way up to 30.

TSMC claimed 25-30% power savings from N7 to N5 and another 30-35% from N5 to N3.  Using these numbers, we get these 4 E-cores using somewhere around 6-7w PEAK, but this is all-core turbo. Intel's CPU at it's most efficient 12w configuration won't hit it's 4.4GHz turbo required to win in single-core performance and is going to hit closer to its 1.2GHz base clock in all-core sustained performance at which point the E-cores not only have their giant IPC advantage, but double the clockspeed too.

You will also use this mixed martial uber shader to use up all the dregs that do not fit within a SMD group.      Eg you might have 104 rays hit a martial but that martial shader can only fit 96 threads into a SIMD group so has 8 remaining thread, you don't want to just dispatch these on there own as that will have very poor occupancy (with 88 threads worth of compute ideal) so you instead inline them within a uber shader along with a load of other overflow.",Neutral

Intel,"Personally Id go B580, higher vram and the drivers have gotten alot better but also be sure to enable resize bar in bios. Its recommended for any gpu but the b580 performance is much better with it on.",Positive
Intel,"By far, get a new GPU.",Neutral
Intel,"The 12400f is still a decent cpu for gaming, a 9070xt would be a good upgrade now, you can update the platform (cpu,ram,and mb) later and still carry the card over a year from now",Positive
Intel,9070xt if you're going to update your cpu later.,Neutral
Intel,GPU. That's nothing really wrong with your CPU and the next two Intel gens have a ton of problems. If you're using it mostly for gaming you'll get much more out of a 9070 XT than from a CPU upgrade depending on what resolution you will be playing at. At 1440p the a770 is fine but still relatively slow and its only real good thing is the 16GB of VRAM. The 9070 XT has twice the performance with better drivers and features. At 1440p you also won't have any CPU bottlenecking with your current one but you likely won't see much difference in performance if you keep your GPU and upgrade your CPU. That all being said this applies to only gaming and at 1440p or higher. If you do a lot of multitasking and content creation you may benefit from an i7 or i9 with a higher core count.,Neutral
Intel,Intel i5 what? There are a lot of i5's.,Neutral
Intel,"Need to know what motherboard you have, i5 is on every socket made in the last 10 years at a guess, so doesn't tell us anything. Odds are though if you're looking at a 9070XT, you'll need a whole new system. Just a guess that it will all be old.",Neutral
Intel,Thanks for this! First time upgrading so I wanted to be sure I made the right choice.,Positive
Intel,Thanks for great response! Will I still be limited to 1440p with the 9070xt and my current CPU?,Positive
Intel,"Sorry, 12400f",Neutral
Intel,"i5-12400f, sorry",Neutral
Intel,Not at all. CPU bottlenecking is an issue with lower resolution(depending on the game) because your CPU is actually generating the frames while your GPU renders the graphics. At low resolution your GPU can easily render frames so the bottleneck is with the CPU. Conversely the GPU is a bottleneck at higher resolution. The higher the resolution the less frames the GPU has the ability to render so the CPU has less work.   So basically right now you're being bottlenecked by a slow GPU. Your CPU has decent boost clock speeds so you would only see issues in very CPU dependent games and only at lower resolution (1080p or less). The 9070 XT is a perfect 1440p card. In rasterization performance it should be able to play any 1440p game at Max settings and ray tracing 120+fps and it can play 4k with high frame rates using FSR.   In situations where you're trying to decide what to upgrade it really comes down to what you're trying to accomplish. If you're gaming at 1080p you have no need to upgrade anything. If you're 1080p gaming and using your PC for content creation or CPU intensive workloads upgrade your CPU. If you're gaming at 1440p and above upgrade your GPU. If you're gaming at high resolution and doing CPU intensive workloads then upgrade both.,Neutral
Intel,Then your GPU is definitely the weak link.,Neutral
Intel,"This is really helpful, thank you for this! Upgrading for the first time and I really needed this info.",Positive
Intel,"I feel like most people would want to run fsr4 quality even on 1440p. The cpu would giga bottleneck in that scenario and even on 1440p native max no rt, my 12600k on ddr4 was holding back my 9070xt on cyberpunk 2077 (not the newest game I know). And on psycho raytracing and fsr4 quality, it also bottlenecked. The 12400f will likely be on ddr4 as well.  But regardless, it's huge upgrade and if OP plans to upgrade platform, there will be another upgrade that will be felt. No system is ever going to be perfectly balanced especially if you play a wide variety of games so it's a solid decision.",Neutral
Intel,"I kind of thought so, but I’m not too knowledgeable on this stuff and wanted to be sure I was making the right choice. After getting the 9070xt, the CPU will be next. Is there anything I should be worried about if I pair it with my current CPU?",Neutral
Intel,"No problem and good luck! Last bit of advice. I would switch to AMD rather than just upgrade to another Intel when you do upgrade your CPU. No matter what you're going to need to upgrade your Mobo and RAM anyway unless you just get an i7 or i9 of the same generation which I wouldn't recommend. If your main PC use is gaming you would benefit a lot more from a 9600X and 32GB of DDR5-6000 than say a 14600k. Not only have 13th and 14th Gen Intel chips had a ton of problems but they're power hungry, are expensive, and run hot so you'll need to get a really good air cooler or AIO. AMD also does long term support on their slots with a new AM4 budget CPU having been released last week even though we're two gens into AM5. My second PC that I use for work has a 12700k that I'm happy with but when I upgrade I'm going to get a 9900X3D or whatever is better at the time in AM5.",Positive
Intel,My 5700X3D is also on DDR4 and I don't hit many situations where I'm CPU limited but to be fair that is an X3D chip. I play cyberpunk on Ray tracing ultra with fsr4 quality and I benchmark at average 68-74 fps without frame gen.,Neutral
Intel,What's your power supply?,Neutral
Intel,"Again, I’m barely dipping my feet into these things, but is it worth looking into getting a 3D CPU for the 9070? I’ve seen it being discussed as ana amazing series of processors, but I don’t know if that’s overkill for what I plan on buying. I just want to get the most of 9070 and kind of build around that for now. Hopefully it lasts me a good amount of years.",Neutral
Intel,"I play a lot of games, but I don’t think they’re too demanding. Mostly things like Overwatch, Fallout, Monster Hunter, Expedition 33 and smaller games like Hades or Slay The Spire. Cyberpunk never interested me and I know that game asks for a lot from your PC.",Negative
Intel,"650w, upgrading to a 850w when I get the 9070xt. I think that’s enough",Neutral
Intel,3D chips main benefit is the extra L3 cache directly on the CPU die. It puts super fast memory right in the cpu that improves gameplay performance especially in CPU intensive games. If your goal is to have a CPU you won't need to upgrade for a long time then it's a good idea but they're expensive so it really depends on what you're willing to spend. The whole reason I'm still able to game on AM4 with such good performance is because I have a 3D chip. That being said you absolutely do not need it to get the most of your 9070 XT. A 9600X is a great CPU for gaming with high clocks and it's very reasonably priced especially if you get it in a bundle with Mobo and RAM. The 9800X3D is more than twice the price and is only necessary for people that are seeking the best possible performance you can get on a gaming PC and should probably be paired with a 5080 or 5090.,Positive
Intel,The most demanding of these is probably monster Hunter but yeah none of them are super demanding. I'll need to do some research to see if they're CPU limited games though.,Neutral
Intel,Looks good to me.,Positive
Intel,"Thanks again for the advice, really helps!",Positive
Intel,would have tried to get onto AM5 with this budget especially with how much cheaper the B570 is in relation to the B580 but overall good parts selection especially if you are someone who waits multiple CPU generations before upgrading,Positive

With Hunt it's very hard to tell what the issue is as it has frequent issues that effect many gpus at the same time. Like a friend playing on amd had different issues at the same time as I did. Honestly couldn't tell you if I've turned the graphics up from low since I had that issue. A770 runs armored core 4 really well to the point that I haven't had to mess with any settings or check fps.,Positive

Intel,"I have an A770 in my rig, genuinely never had a problem unless it was Fallout 3",Positive
Intel,I had a B580 near launch. Was my replacement for a 1080ti at the time. It was totally fine for my use case. I did upgrade to a 4080 later but that was more due to my use case changing (built a sim racing rig with a large format 4k TV) than the performance of the card itself. I was also quite partial to the understated looks of the card,Positive
Intel,"Ive used plenty of Arcs and have enjoyed the performance and compatability.  The 1 weird thing is in one older game I played, the game defaulted to my PCs AMD iGPU, and wouldnt run on the Arc without disabling the iGPU in the BIOS.

Intel,I want one for av1 encoding pbad. But other than it sitting in my server for that one use case it wouldn’t get used.,Neutral
Intel,Bad compared to a 5090. Sure.  Bad for price to performance. No.  My main problem with arc is that its still early days. If they make another generation assuming the rnd team survives lay-offs I might pick one up.,Negative

It also has a dedicated RTX 3050Ti, I have been surprised that leaving the RTX disabled I'm still able to emulate PS2 and 360 (Xenia) perfectly. I only use the RTX for heavier Steam games due to heat output and power consumption.

Intel,"Threw one in my son's computer, was a good bit cheaper than the equivalent Nvidia card and still a bit cheaper than the AMD.  Doom TDA is the most intensive game he plays and it has no problem with it so that's good enough for me.",Positive
Intel,"Have a b580 & so far so good. Bf6, cyberpunk, sm2, EfT, etc all run great.   I'm not frame chasing, as long as the games I play run with no stutter lags & look good I'm happy. I don't need to see the absolute detailed zit on a character's face in their stubble beard at 4k ultra settings at 196fps.   Would definitely like to see what a beefier card could be if they made one. You get a solid amount of vram, low price, & no burning cable. I hope it has a 1080ti lifecycle. But also waiting to see how much the C, D, etc improve.",Positive
Intel,A750 in a second build. Great for 1080p in most games,Positive
Intel,It's an amazing value. I used one after my 4090 and was kinda shocked how well it played COD and Warzone.,Positive
Intel,"Got an Arc B580 for the price/performance ratio, coming from an RX 5700 XT. Was a good bit of an upgrade in a lot of newer games. Honestly think it's a great card for that purpose.  Unfortunately, I ran into poor performance that was a no-go for me. Yakuza Kiwami had a huge issue (ran at like 50-55 fps with horrible lows that made it jittery, while my 5700 XT easily pushed 144, which makes sense, it's basically a PS3 era engine with better assets). From what I can tell, 0, Kiwami 2, and YLAD all had the same issue, and they got fixed over the course of a few years. The problem with that is that 0 was reported on the forum like 2 years before it was fixed. I was in the middle of a playthrough and couldn't just wait for reasonable, playable performance. I even tried DXVK and got a big boost (like 90-100ish), but it was still very unstable.  So you really do have to beware of older games still, despite the drivers having improved a lot and being overall solid. Some other DX11 titles ran perfectly fine though.  OpenGL performance? Forget it. Necesse uses Java and OpenGL and I managed about 70fps before using Mesa for Windows to get a boost. Still wasn't ideal compared to my 5700 XT, once again (and AMD isn't known for OpenGL performance on Windows lmao).  So overall, I think it's a great piece of hardware with mostly solid drivers, but it's not good enough for me on the driver side and I don't want to wait. It lasted 2 weeks before I returned it and got a 9060 XT 16GB (which is again a good bit of an upgrade from the B580, so the extra cost doesn't hurt as bad. I've been waiting for so long for an upgrade that made sense to me).  This was all in the middle of last month. Got my 9060 XT on the 30th.  I'd also like to note that they did alleviate most of the CPU overhead issues recently, so my 5600G wasn't an issue in games that did run well, like The Finals (actually ran extremely well with maxed out settings, and XeSS is actually really good on the Arc cards).",Positive
Intel,"If I haven't got the RTX4060 LP, I would definitely vuy the B580",Positive

Intel,I have it in my NAS and for plex transcoding its a godsent. It just works.  Do be honest for my main rig it will not be an option for a long time. NVidia has with Cuda just to much stuff that i use daily.   AMD is years behind sadly.,Positive
Intel,I'd buy any companies gpu if its good price and good performance.   But I feel like Ibwould be a beta tester at this point.,Positive
Intel,Arc team reporting!,Neutral
Intel,Replaced my 5700xt with a b580.   Performance is equal or slightly better at 1440p ultrawide.  The 5700xt was running out of VRAM in some games though and I was having very frequent driver crashes too.  The b580 has actually been a smoother experience.  The 5700xt has moved into a pc that had a 1050ti so it loves on being a very capable 1080p card,Positive

Intel,"arc a770, it crashes alot",Negative
Intel,It would have been good if Intel didn't scrap the idea for something better than the B580 because if we were to have the B750/770 there could have been a more affordable option to compete against the RX 9070 and RTX 5070 but of course Intel got rid of that notion and we would have to wait for the next series of GPUs if they do plan on making one which would most likely compete against the RX 9060 XT and RTX 5060 Ti 16GB cards.,Neutral

Since it's an 8x card, any consumer grade motherboard with two x16 slots that split the primary slot lanes when both are populated ultimately does not suffer a dip in performance.  Plus the linux friendly nature of the cards means that I can pack a double-bazzite PC in my bag and take anywhere.  It makes road trips and game nights significantly easier.",Positive

Intel,I’m on a regular 2080 and feel the same way.  Still hoping for a B770 release and that it would be a worthwhile upgrade.,Positive
Intel,"I'd say it's good with i5s, they just seriously improved the CPU overhead performance with i5 and i7.",Positive
Intel,I do wonder if this is a problem with CPUs that don't have iGPUs.,Neutral
Intel,Probably better due to the higher VRAM and clock speed.,Positive
Intel,"Actually, they just fixed that recently. Used an i5-14400F and it ran absolutely pristine.",Negative
Intel,Fun thing: try and see if you can use lossless scaling and combine the rtx with the igpu.,Positive
Intel,"Is amd years behind or just blocked out of the game.  Nvidia holds the market because of cuda, and cuda is proprietary to nvidia and very old tech so almost all programs are designed to take advantage of cuda.  Amd is not allowed to make a cuda equivalent and developers dont want to write their code for something new.    Thats not years of behind, thats a monopoly.",Negative

Intel,"I can understand that without judgement. I only just replaced my GTX 1080 a few weeks ago. Had that thing running for over 7 years and it's still got enough life left in it to go into a secondary computer for a few more years of service.

Intel,Even just 12GB like the 4070 would have made it last longer   Same for the 3080,Neutral
Intel,16 and 24 gigs wasted on it as the core can barely utilize 12gigs without shitting the bed.,Neutral
Intel,"Unless intel confirms the cancellation of ARC officially as a whole, then that means pretty much nothing.",Negative
Intel,"Maybe you don't get the reason for your downvotes, but at least one of them is that their cpu and gpu departments are completely separate, no that's why there was a big disconnect between Intel cpu and gpu quality, it's essentially 2 different companies sharing intel's name",Negative
Intel,Is that on paper? No? Then it doesn’t exist.,Negative
Intel,"Intel doesn't compete at the high end, if anything it just takes even more market share from amd so idk why Nvidia would stop it.",Neutral
Intel,"The partnership is because, as much as people in this sub argue otherwise, the age of large APUs has begun. They're likely not gonna catch on in DIY desktop, but for laptop and mini-PC's, giant APUs with large iGPUs are going to likely replace entry level dGPU.   So the partnership allows Nvidia to, instead of selling a GPU chip to a motherboard OEM to be soldered, will now sell that chip to Intel to be integrated into the SoC package as a chiplet.   It doesn't mean Arc is dead. It means Nvidia is ensuring they aren't squeezed out of this new emerging market",Neutral

Intel,"It's not A310, it's A380 (although it's power limited to 43W) and it's not connected to the chipset, but directly to the CPU. I've picked up motherboard that has two large PCIe slots running at PCIe gen 4 speed, connected directly to the CPU, exactly for this reason. 2nd slot uses 4 lanes though, but it's more than enough for 3440x1440 170Hz uncompressed video.",Neutral
Intel,Would it be good for CAD modeling?,Positive
Intel,"maybe a slight bottleneck in 1080p, but nothing to worry about.",Neutral
Intel,"It seems like I'm still more bound by the GPU and maybe something else. I can see in MangoHUD in e.g. Tiy Tina's Wonderlands my GPU at 60-70% and my CPU only at 15-20%.

I also considered the MSI Claw but it apparently sucked for another reason.",Neutral
Intel,That all got fixed in the first month,Neutral
Intel,Its really funny you felt compelled to comment this as a reply to this specific comment and not as a comment as a whole,Negative
Intel,Like?,Neutral
Intel,"Not exactly better, but there was some performance increase compared to the 6700XT. In scenarios I could use Intel XeSS instead of AMD FSR, I got more frames with increased image quality.  For comparison, I paid for a brand new B580 the same price of a used 6700XT. It was a no-brainer and I am not suffering from CPU bottleneck, which isn't a big issue since the .8xxx drivers.",Positive
Intel,"Woo! I love that thing, its so good for an igpu",Positive
Intel,It's not that's its budget. It's the support full stop. They are not supporting a use case that many use. They are throwing away sales.,Negative
Intel,"It was early adopter teething issues mainly. I haven't had any issues recently, Intel has fixed A LOT of stuff over time. My main source of complaint now is just that their driver software is lacking some features compared to my previous Radeon card. I'd rather Intel focus on perfecting the basics rather than implementing a bunch of fancy driver features though",Negative
Intel,A lot of the early issues was with older games. Intel didn’t have years of optimizations to make sure they run well especially with a tech change I can’t remember the details on. I believe they fixed it.,Negative
Intel,"Yeah, I would like to see a 16gb version or at least a better 12gb.",Neutral
Intel,"Okay, that’s good to hear, though isn’t that more of a budget card? I’d *assume* the most common setup would be with an i3.  The main point of criticism I heard is that you can get a last-gen used AMD card for around the same price and get better performance overall. If that’s still true, then I’d withhold on saying it’s truly a good card. Just a step in the right direction.",Positive
Intel,"Yeah, we even have our own subreddit, r/IntelArc",Negative
Intel,If Intel's version of XT and Ti was a -K suffix that would go so hard,Neutral
Intel,Pay more than 1000 bucks for a card. You have to tweak the power consumption or it starts burning. Big clown face.,Neutral

Intel,"I just think people are sniffing copium. I want intel to do well in gpu department as much as the next guy, but reality is different. Often dissapointing.  The things that intel has to do to be on-par with current competitiors is astounding. However, I do hope I'm wrong and intel *can* find a way.",Negative
Intel,"Video encoding and just displaying my desktop, so my RTX can run headless so I can passthrough it to a VM if I need to.",Neutral
Intel,"Do you do a lot of video editing? I'm not familiar with this, and I'm wondering at what point I would need a separate GPU for video encoding.",Neutral
Intel,"Smart, are you using a display streaming like parsec?",Neutral
Intel,"That's why I picked up single slot low profile version. Slightly more expensive and power limited, but it doesn't block that much.",Neutral
Intel,Might be! I haven't tested that myself.,Neutral
Intel,"its a productivity beast, but if youre frames are uncapped and your gpu isnt getting to 100 percent usage, youre cpu bottlenecked, as most games only use 1 or 2 cores usage percentage means very little",Neutral

Intel,I'm assuming 8 pcie lanes,Neutral
Intel,"8 pcie lanes instead of the usual 16 so half the bandwidth for a given generation.  The PCIe bus is used to share information between the card and the rest of the system. It's usually not a bottleneck (the GPU can't process data as fast as it comes in through the bus), but it's a noticeable one when you're low on VRAM and the GPU needs to fetch data in the system RAM through the PCIe bus. Mostly an issue with 8 GB cards like the 5060.",Neutral
Intel,Ah. Shame that the Intel cards never got a market in my country. Wouldve definitely snapped one when I built my PC,Negative
Intel,"If I were to get one for my kiddo, would I expect more troubleshooting for Steam games or ability to play less of them?",Neutral
Intel,Yeah K or KS would be cool though i think XE as nod to HEDT and the X299 platform with the i9 9980XE and i9 10980XE could also go super hard.,Positive

Intel,Deshrouding rules,Neutral
Intel,"No, I don't do a lot. The main goal wa to use it as a display GPU, but the AV1 encoding is a nice bonus. I run OBS in replay mode (10 minutes) in the background and this intel GPU is used for encoding.  I want my Nvidia GPU to not have any monitors connected to it, so I can switch between using it in my host OS and in the VM, here's an example of how it works: [https://youtu.be/3fiXFv85iRU](https://youtu.be/3fiXFv85iRU)  This allows me to for example stream a game directly from a VM to my TV and still use my PC to do something else, like for example few weeks ago we played Trine 2 with my brother, when I was running the game in both the VM and host (one copy on Nvidia and one on Intel) and we played multiplayer together.  I used to use the VM to play everything like year or two ago, but the Nvidia drivers on linux improved significantly, so nowadays I don't use it nearly as much, but I still do from time to time. Plus it's always nice to have a backup plan for running some anticheats.",Positive
Intel,"I'm using looking-glass. It's a bit different than parsec, it works by copying frames from the main GPU's framebuffer into the shared system memory segment and then to the 2nd GPU's memory. No compression and very low latency (I use virtual display in my Windows VM that I can set to 500Hz, which gives me around 2.5ms of added latency in total).  I also use Sunshine and Moonlight when straming to a TV or remotely to my laptop or phone. I have the cheapest server in OVH that I use as a VPN, so I can access my PC or share some services over internet (like my personal cloud for example: [https://cloud.yayuuu.pl/index.php/apps/memories/s/pKqfn86wLLy6xZM](https://cloud.yayuuu.pl/index.php/apps/memories/s/pKqfn86wLLy6xZM) ), so I can game from anywhere, just login over SSH to my home server, wake on lan PC, start a VM and connect using Moonlight).",Neutral
Intel,"Good point, I guess it isn't necessarily the best gaming CPU, but I quite like its speed for compiling etc.  Getting some 5xxx CPU seems like just a small step up and wouldn't be cheap. And anything even higher would mean basically replacing everything: Mainboard, RAM and CPU. Going with a lower core count and higher boosts might be better for gaming, but would feel like too much of a downgrade.  Ironically most games, which I play besides Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, are such old titles, that both GPU and CPU are complete overkill. And lately I found just far too little time for gaming in general to make it worth it with the current prices to get some DDR5.  Edit: I just checked and at least according to Wikipedia the Ryzen 5000 CPUs aren't clocked all that differently. Its successor the 5900X has a boost of 4,8GHz, but same core count and same L3 cache and same TDP.",Neutral
Intel,I don't know what that means in layman's terms. Does it cap bandwidth like older hdmi resolution? Does it limit my kid's Minecraft terrain generation range? Does it mean I only run 69 mods on Skyrim instead of 420?,Negative
Intel,"To be fair I don't play *that* many different games, but I haven't come across one that simply doesn't work. The biggest game compatibility issue I ever ran into was with StarCraft Remastered not rendering at full resolution. My theory is that they were specifically checking for Intel (what would've been only slow iGPUs at the time) and disabling high resolution. Blizzard fixed it though thankfully.   This video is over a year old, so things have only improved since then. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the issues shown have been addressed: https://youtu.be/Y09iNxx5nFE",Negative
Intel,For what I've played using an A750 card on steam the only game I've ever had issues with is Kenshi which would crash out on me for whatever reason but nothing else seems to have any noticeable issues.,Negative
Intel,WTF. I corrected it a bit.,Neutral
Intel,The point is that premium product should be perfectly tuned out of the box.,Neutral
Intel,"There is always room to tweak. Fact is, the burning connector should not happen on a product that expensive.",Negative
Intel,"It’s cool you’ve got the best GP that’s ever U-ed and it’s even cooler that you made it suck less (power), but the reason people are diasgreeing with you is because you’re defending an inarguably bad design with the argument of “but it works on my machine”.",Positive
Intel,"Your not a clown, you’re the whole circus buddy",Negative
Intel,"Wait, if you don't connect your Nvidia to monitors, does that mean the thing you see on monitors is only rendered by the Arc?    So, is it like how you stream from game pass? Where you let other PC run and calculate the game (your VM in this case) and then stream the game on your host OS?    Are there advantages in doing this? How are the graphics compared to directly using your Nvidia?  When you say that you rarely play on the VM nowadays, do you mean your Nvidia is connected to the monitors? Or is there a way to split the task without VM?  Also when you played Trine 2, does that mean the game looks better on TV than your PC? Since Ark is weaker.  Sorry for asking many questions lol",Neutral
Intel,"😂 Just has less bandwidth, but still really damn good.",Positive
Intel,"It caps the bandwidth. But that's fine because it's not strong enough to even utilize the full bandwidth that 16 lanes would provide. And those extra lanes would just increase cost.   This *may* be a problem on an old motherboard, because 8 lanes of PCIe *may* be too little (idk, didn't see any tests). But 8 lanes of PCIe4 are more than sufficient.",Negative
Intel,"You need to change your expectations if that is your point.  If you buy a stick of RAM today, it is going to run at half speed if you don't go into the bios and correct it. If you don't want to tune your PC, don't build one yourself.",Negative

Intel,"https://preview.redd.it/5utu2xxvee1g1.png?width=5240&format=png&auto=webp&s=a281c9815d6408496deeaa752ed61862de335754  No, I can choose which GPU I use for rendering. That's basically what laptops are doing this with multiple GPUs. I just set these environmental variables in the steam's launch parameters: DXVK\_FILTER\_DEVICE\_NAME=""NVIDIA"" \_\_NV\_PRIME\_RENDER\_OFFLOAD=1 \_\_GLX\_VENDOR\_LIBRARY\_NAME=nvidia   and it will run on Nvidia. I can do the same with any other app, like browser, blender, etc. The screenshot shows an example of the game running bare-metal on nvidia-gpu and being displayed on intel GPU.  To not repeat the same parameters with every game, I've made a simple bash script that just exports these variables (and few more, like DLSS upgrade, etc), so I just type ""setenv %command%"" in steam lauinch parameters and that's it.  When running a VM, I use looking-glass, which is different than streaming the game to another device over LAN (like in your example with gamepass). Looking-glass uses shared memory to copy frames from one device to another, so it only works within one PC, but the video is uncompressed and with minimal latency (like 2-3ms of added latency). This is essentially the same path as offloading rendering but with one additional limitation - windows forces vsync, so I need to run as high refresh rate inside windows as possible to reduce latency. I use Virtual display adapter that allows me to set up to 500Hz and run desktop without any physical monitors attached.",Neutral
Intel,"Trine 2 is not that demanding, both GPUs can run it at max settings just fine. This is also true with a lot of older games. With new games it wouldn't work like this, but there is another way. Linux has a built-in multiseat, that allows logging in 2 different users at the same time, giving them access to different monitors, input devices, etc. I could use a 4k dummy plug to enable multiseat on that device and stream from there to the TV, but I don't have it configured right now, as I still need VM sometimes, so usually it's enough.",Neutral
Intel,"So like a v6 Camaro? Not as fast at the suped up v8, but still better than a Corolla?",Neutral
Intel,"I think it’s less about “not getting the full performance”, and more about it being a fire hazard.   Especially when you pay that kind of money for it.    In fact, one could argue that the consumer shouldn’t be able to make your product into a fire hazard, even if they aggressively fuck around with software parameters. As long as no modifications were done to the hardware - it should be perfectly safe. Sure it may not function properly, but it shouldn’t melt itself.",Negative
Intel,"Your ram clocks actually depends on your other hardware, its not the case for gpu. Its fine that you like it, but other may not, and nothing on the box say i need to understand something about overcklocking\\downcklocking. Also i doubt that some random dude will spend time to play with your gpu settings if you buy prebuilt, you will just get it as it is.",Neutral
Intel,"More like the transmission than the engine. PCIe lanes determine how much compute (horsepower) can get to the CPU (Road) so if your GPU (Engine) is performing really well but is bottlenecked by PCIe lanes, you aren't really getting that level of performance.   It's also why this objection to the Intel cards is a bit of a moot point. If you are running a v6 than you don't need the best transmission, the car isn't making the power to necessitate more HP to the wheels.",Neutral
Intel,"I'm the guy that bypasses restrictive software and hardware to do what I want, so I won't advocate for any more dummy proofing. That is one of the reasons I hate Apple.",Negative
Intel,"So sounds like an Average Joe won't notice, especially compared to other cards of the same price?",Neutral
Intel,"I don’t mind tinkering(in fact I enjoy it a lot, both at my job as a software dev, and as a hobby).  However, hardware+firmware(when not modified) should not allow software to set unsafe parameters, period. And the fact that those unsafe parameters are set from the factory - is all the more insane.",Neutral
Intel,Of all the differences between cards at that price range the number of PCIe lanes it has will be the last thing you'll notice.,Neutral
Intel,"A couple things stand out to me here:  - CPU not going above 60°C is strange, unless you’re running a very beefy water cooler. Did you try running something like Cinebench and compare the results to other 5700X?  - Are those 16gb of RAM a single stick or two? If two, are the in the correct slots (one free slot between the two)?  Intels gpu drivers are known to be quite heavy on the CPU, but I don’t think a 5700X should struggle that much.",Neutral
Intel,So  the cooler is not anything special like an assasin spirit evo 120 but I got 2 new coolers for the case because i was sure heating was the problem.But under load It researched 75c yesterday. but it runs cool thats what I was trying to say.I will fix that.  Dual slot and they are in the first and third slot.  My motherboard doesnt support PCIE4 and people told me that could be weird but from everything that i saw on videos and forums it shouldnt affect that much the fps.,Neutral
Intel,"The slow RAM is definitely dragging your CPU down a bit, but it shouldn't be that much of an issue. PCIe 3.0 should also be fine for that combo.  Have you tried running a CPU benchmark?",Neutral

Intel,Can you up your budget to $350?  9060xt 16gb is more powerful than wither of those options and vram should keep it relevant a long time.,Positive
Intel,"I think the b580 is the better buy. The 5060 has worse fps/dollar, and less vram",Negative
Intel,At a base it's around 20ish percent better but the extra vram in the b580 might help it last longer.  I'd go for the b580,Positive
Intel,"Intel Arc is still today for a  Tech Savy Enthussiast with alot of patience,   There is alot of probleme to be fix still.  The 5060 is your best bet if you want to game without have to troubleshoot every time. and the software stack (feature) is superior, Even if stability-wise the last year of NvidiaApp driver as been a hit and miss.  Radeon would be a choice but checking the current pricing for 9060 xt 8go variant. the saving dont make up for the nvidia advantage.  Specialy that in a close futur Nvidia Neural Texture compression is going to leave Beta and turning the VRAM argument to old history.

Intel,Never looked into AMD cards (only reason I looked at Intel was because I was bored in my hardware class) but I will take a look,Neutral
Intel,"The b580 is a decent budget card, but the 16gb vram of the amd make it an attractive option for the price point.",Positive
Intel,i4-14700 and Arc B580.. not saying any of those choices are wrong... but the i7 is a high end CPU paired with a budget GPU. i5-14600K and 9060XT could've been better but ok... and also the Arc B580 can't really play on 4K without HEAVY XeSS.,Negative
Intel,"It is a pretty questionable HTPC build tbh. You definitely should’ve allocated more money to the GPU.   14700 is a pricey chip, I’m sure the 14600k is cheaper and you easily could’ve power limited it in bios. Alternatively a 14400 would’ve been fine too.  As well I went ddr4 with my build and it was quite a bit cheaper.   Sf750 for this build is super overkill. It’s a great PSU, I have 2 of them, but they are very pricey.   Just the cost of fans you probably could’ve gotten a 9060xt as well.",Neutral
Intel,"This is not a gaming PC, it’s a media centre PC. For gaming, I use an RTX 4070 Super. The 65 watt i7 was chosen because it’s a cool running CPU, averaging 30–32 degrees in this build. Also, to semi future proof it for if I ever do turn it into a gaming PC. The Arc B580 was chosen for it’s great through-hole design that helps with airflow, which is beneficial given this SFF PC’s restrictive layout. That said, I have another build with a ARC B580 that games at 1440p just fine, so this PC would still be perfectly capable for gaming.",Positive
Intel,"It’s pointless to invest more money into the GPU at this stage, given that this is a media centre PC and not a gaming rig. The 65 watt i7-14700 was chosen not only because it’s a cool-running CPU, averaging 30–32 degrees, but also to semi future-proof the system in case I decide to convert it into a gaming PC later on. If that happens, I’d be using a higher-end GPU and wouldn’t want to be limited by an i5. The Arc B580 was selected because it’s more than capable for my current needs and features a through-hole design that helps with airflow. As for the PSU, while a 750-watt PSU isn’t strictly necessary, it’s 2025 and with GPUs continuing to demand more power, I wouldn’t go any lower. With the way this build is set up, I’d only need to upgrade the GPU in a few years, and that’s only if I choose to turn it into a gaming PC. The fans, been using Noctua fans for many years and I wouldn’t touch anything else.",Neutral

Intel,What does media center pc mean in your context? For me my HTPC is being used like a gaming pc for my TV.   Also Intel is very good with idle power draw but make sure you’ve limited the boost wattage. For me I’ve limited my 14500 to 95w on short bursts. The 14700 should have a higher base boost power.,Neutral
Intel,"I mean just watching movies, listening to music, streaming and video encoding. No gaming.  I also have a 14500, a 14700K, and another 14700 in three other PCs. Those are gaming systems, and I’ve found that when set to Intel default settings, they average around 60–65 degrees during gaming without me needing to enforce power limits, since Intel default settings enforce them automatically.  Edit: 60–65 degrees for the non-K CPUs. My 14700K runs more like 70–75 degrees. Honestly, I much prefer the non-K 14700, since in my benchmarks it performed only 3–5% lower, yet ran cooler and used less power. Not like anyone overclocks these days anyway.",Neutral

Intel,"AMD have clarified their original stupid as fuck statement mate. Apparently what the utterly inept fuckwads in their marketing department were MEANT to say, according to the engineers, is that any NEW software tech that's developed from now on, will only be available for 7000 series and up GPU's. RDNA1 and RDNA2 GPU's will continue to receive the same game ready style drivers as they always have.   It just means that if AMD develop anything new, like FSR4, it won't be made backward compatible with older cards. A lot of us have been saying for years that AMD's entire marketing team should be fired, and replaced with people from the engineering department, because this level of fuck up is literally so common that their nickname these days is ""Advanced Marketing Department"", and not in a good way.",Negative

Intel,Their marketing team is certainly one that gives the vibes of 100% nepo appointments.,Negative
Intel,"The Advanced Marketing department thing comes from that deranged weirdo at UBM, if memory serves, and the irony is that he makes that joke to imply that they are only good at marketing, but bad at creating products, which is the literal inverse of reality. AMD's products are pretty good, but jesus christ on a cracker is their market utterly horrendous",Negative
Intel,This makes perfect sense with redstone supposedly coming this year of course they were going to split the driver stack. Terrible communication aside this seems pretty obvious,Negative
Intel,I hope thats what AMD will actually do and not just PR corporate bullshit meant to save face. Still kinda sucks that 6000 series will never get official FSR 4 support unlike the 2000 series getting DLSS 4 which is a massive improvement.,Negative
Intel,So kind of like microsofts feature support vs extended support  You don't get the new shiny but we fix what you already have  I suppose you'd only see over time if that's a big deal or not. Personally I do like products having at least some on no new features extended support. That way if a new feature brakes things it isn't one of the final patches you see(How long that should be I'm not sure),Neutral

Intel,"It's still pretty dumb: if eg. FSR4 or any new feature set can improve the performance of an older card, without an inherently crapton of additional massaging, it should be made to do so. And reportedly, FSR4 has already been shown to work on and improve performance of these older generation RDNA cards in modded drivers, so it has been demonstrated that the only obstacle in implementing it is a profit-seeking one. Though saying that is there not profit in providing value for customers on older hardware, doesn't that build the brand, etc. or are they just interested in pushing the next generation of eWaste into the bin sooner.",Neutral

Intel,">is that any NEW software tech that's developed from now on, will only be available for 7000 series and up GPU's  Well that's disappointing. It's way too soon. I'm sure it's not just due to hardware limitations, since 6000 and 7000 share similar hardware necessary for upscaling. They can't throw that ""we drop support because compatibility blah blah"" card on consumers.  Well on a positive note, it's good that 6000 series will still get FSR4 support thru mods, although that might be limited, as some online games could trigger anticheats.",Negative
Intel,That just sounds like BS from AMD.   Why come out and say something you already said. What this sounds like is AMD trying to back peddle a decision that would cost them future sales. The best part is if they get this out there now. Then oops don't update for games moving forward. Then no one will say a word. It will be done and over with.   Everyone knew FSR4 and the like wasn't coming to RDNA1/2 gpu's they said this before. They don't back port new stuff anyway.   So just more corpo speak for hey we screwed up now forget bout it look a shiny thing consumer look at the shiny.,Negative
Intel,Which I feel like they didn’t need to say? Like obviously not every feature is going to be supported an older hardware already right now FSR 4 is not available on the 7000 series though the rumour is they will have it eventually. Like why is this something the end user needs to be informed about?   I almost wonder if they were planning on pulling Support and then just decided to say that it was misinterpreted because they saw the reaction,Negative
Intel,"> RDNA1 and RDNA2 GPU's will continue to receive the same game ready style drivers as they always have.  Where did they say that.

Intel,"I'm pretty sure the clarification had a big asterisk of something along the lines ""we will continue updating them according to market demand"", i think they're still moving them to maintenance mode the same they did for Polaris and Vega which means they will continue necessary bug and security fixes, unlikely to recieve optimizations (tho still possible) but more importantly no new features will be added, this kinda sucks when you consider RTX 20 series which is older than RDNA2 is still receiving partial support for new DLSS features.",Negative
Intel,the original message was slightly ambiguous but then literally every news outlet choose to interpret it in the very worst way possible and then add clickbait headlines on top of that misinterpretation. The resulting mess is only marginally AMD's fault.  They aren't saying anything now that wasn't in what they said originally.,Negative

They believed it enough that they actually let some performance out of the bag and into the market... otherwise they would have released a crappier card on purpose, because that is legitimately what NVIDIA do without any real competition: hold back technology and dribble it out in ever crappier improvements year on year.  AI is cool, but apart from GPT doing my spreadsheets for me (which costs OpenAI far more than my subscription) , it's made every single product it's integrated in worse.  It's already at the point where a customer faced with the choice between AI assistant integrated VS vocally proclaiming no AI...they will pick the one without AI because it's just data harvesting guff.

No different than the Dot Com bubble or Mobile App bubble or social media bubble. Some companies like OpenAI or Google or Anthropic will ""win"", they'll buy up any startup/smaller company that actually shows promise (or potentially has promise and would deny competitors the engineers working there) then the market will calcify.

Intel,"Data Centers use a lot of power, and there's more demand for data centers than before, but this isn't a specific to AI problem. I've ran local LMs (Llama primarily) on my own server, they're not significantly harder or demanding to run than a typical server. Per the UPS I have attached to it, that single server uses around 200-400W the average is around 1700kW/h per year, and this is a fairly inefficient homelab.   Image/Video generation on the other hand, requires a lot more processing power, as anyone who's worked VFX will tell you, but this isn't the bulk of work that LLMs are doing. It's also why AI was able to ""pop up"" on every site so quickly, as it's really not significantly more intensive for Cloud providers than most K8S systems. This isn't a _pro_ AI comment btw, just noting that the power consumption aspect is a bit of misinformation that companies like OpenAI are _themselves_ pushing as if they make it seem too intensive to ""get in"" at this point, they solidify themselves as the defacto winner of the AI bubble. It's also why they recently have started bringing up ""ethical concerns"" about data theft and wanting regulation on data scraping...because they've already scraped everything.

You had ridiculous stuff pop up nearly everyday and get investment, and then in 2-3 years the investors (and the companies) realized they had no way to actually make money, so the bubble burst.  You can look up articles and videos on it by searching for ""Dot Com Bubble"", it's often discussed.  Ironically, many of the failed businesses' ideas are a profitable thing now, and similar websites and companies exist - but the fact was the infrastructure and demand just wasn't there 25 years ago.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, but we're talking about Nvidia. So they'll still be in the AI game for as long as AI exists. So the bubble bursting will never bankrupt Nvidia, only companies buying from Nvidia.

Intel,"There's already a solution for EAC for games like Fortnite, though. The companies are just too lazy to do it. It's literally a opt-in option in the Epic Online Services Dev portal.

Intel,"i did my own test for 14700k vs 9800x3d and this is how it was  [https://youtu.be/sZIlzI\_F2XM?si=ZZghGYJ0FM92jH3l](https://youtu.be/sZIlzI_F2XM?si=ZZghGYJ0FM92jH3l)  14700k vs 9700x  [https://youtu.be/X2zpplzKfuc?si=qjcnSUdY1xHRlWmc](https://youtu.be/X2zpplzKfuc?si=qjcnSUdY1xHRlWmc)  ive tested 14700k on 6c12t configuration and it managed to beat 9700x in every game  6c12t of 14700k vs 9700x  Spider man2 170fps vs 145fps  Re4 140fps vs 130fps  Horizon zero dawn 150fps vs 136fps  Cp 2077 150fps vs 136fps  Though that was with DDR5-7200; on DDR5-6000, they perform on par, since Intel scales with memory speed, while AMD doesn’t because the IMC will run at a 2:1 mode on ddr5 6400+, so practically on ddr5 7200 14600k should be faster than 9700x  in my opinion, the choice should be either the 7000/9000 X3D series or Intel’s 14th gen. I’ve never tested the Core Ultra chips before, but I bet they aren’t as bad as some reviewers make them out to be.",Neutral
Intel,Get a case with preinstalled fans like montech king 65 pro,Neutral
Intel,"You might as well just go for a 14700K or 14900K. Or if you’re planning on hanging on to this thing for a while, just go ahead and spend the little extra to run a 265K or 285K. They overclock very well and do get meaningful bumps in performance from faster RAM.  The extra cost compared to a 14600K will be meaningless after a year or two but the performance difference will be very noticeable.   Having spent most of my PC building/Gaming Life as an Intel fanboy, personally I think the x700K (what is now 265K for the Core Ultra) model of Intel CPUs always seemed to be the best bang for the buck performance vs cost vs longevity.",Positive
Intel,"If you want to go Intel, get the 265K. Its such a good upgrade from the 245K for under 100 bucks. Its around 280 dollars, competes with the 9700X in gaming and with the 9900X (400 dollar CPU) in productivity. Also supports higher RAM speeds if that is important for you.",Positive
Intel,"Hop on AM5 and dont look back, you have a far wider range of upgrade options than anything intel could offer right now. the 7600X is a good entry point for AM5 but there are far better offerings in the ryzen 7/9 range for your workload. once you get into ryzen 7 and beyond you dont need anything else for any workload.",Positive
Intel,That's so sad 😭,Negative
Intel,Good idea. I was gonna go with the montech air 903,Positive
Intel,"Doesn't really make sense to get 14th gen. A new 265k is cheaper than a new 14700k or 14900k and getting them used seems ill-advised to me (it also isn't even much cheaper than a new 265k anyways, so kind of a pointless risk).",Negative
Intel,"Ram is important, none of these seem to be bad choices, theres at least 2 intel CPUs I could pick and 2 AMD so it really comes down to if I want to go editing or gaming focused.",Positive
Intel,Understood 🫡 7700X it is.,Neutral
Intel,"Its subjective but I find the air 903 looks quite different irl from the advertised images make sure to check th builds in reviews to see if it fits your taste, the king 65 pro on the other hand has tinted glass   This build is with 245kf, no integrated graphics since you have a gpu https://pcpartpicker.com/list/sKts9C  This one with a 9600x https://pcpartpicker.com/list/4hz9b2  245kf is better for editing, 9600x is slighly better for gaming and like 12% slower for editing but the platform is upgradable",Neutral
Intel,"I guess you will have to find an equilibrium that provides the most performance between the 2. AMD officially supports 5600MHz RAM but it can be overclocked in the BIOS with EXPO and Intel supports 6400MHz and with 200S Boost it supports up to 8000MHz but the specific RAM kit matters.   If you go with AMD I do believe 6400MHz would be stable on their CPU's. Just research based on people who actually have systems with 6400MHz RAM kit with Ryzen 9000 CPU's. good luck also with the RAM prices, hopefully your budget is flexible with whats going on.",Neutral
Intel,"From what I've read, you still want the intel iGPU and its quick sync feature for video editing.",Neutral
Intel,"Same, did a quick search and apparently quicksync can help accelerate some tasks in some editing suits, granted its data from 3 years ago but should still be relevant, you also get something to fallback on if your gpu fails, seems worth for $30 extra if you can squeeze it",Neutral
Intel,It's the PCI slots that do it for me.,Positive
Intel,pretty sweet! do you plan on doing a platform update later on,Neutral
Intel,Serving us proudly!,Neutral
Intel,Love it. Enjoy!  I briefly panicked when I first saw the PCI slots and an Intel ARC thinking it was an ancient motherboard. That motherboard sure did throw me.,Positive
Intel,I believe that's called vintage thank you,Positive
Intel,"Most likely, but nothing concrete planned out yet. Hoping to string some upgrades together over a couple years so I can build something out of the leftovers for my young kids. Stuff might just be too old by that time. I guess paint is pretty easy on the specs though lmao.  Could be looking for something sooner if I actually hit this fabled arc bottleneck.",Neutral
Intel,Yeah it is pretty old for PC parts tbf. Definitely a gamble to try the arc with 8th gen too. Kind of why I ended up just building something new for my wife instead of going down this path first.,Negative
Intel,I never thought I'd see a depreciated interface on a modern board it's mind blowing.,Neutral
Intel,No B580?,Neutral
Intel,"9060XT. Newer, better performance",Positive
Intel,8gb is ass. 16gb is great.  Just get a B580 if the 16gb isn't in your budget.,Negative
Intel,"Digital art as in 2d Photoshop, Clip Studio Paint, Rebelle, Corel Painter, etc are almost completely CPU and memory bound. Even the 3d model poser in CSP is completely CPU. So I would recommend you max out CPU and invest in 64gb (or more) in ram before worrying about the GPU - it'll give her a much better experience in these programs.  But to answer your GPU question directly, I think investing in an Nvidia card would be good since a lot of 2d artists will eventually move into dabbling 3d work (Blender, Cubism, etc) and those thrive on Nvidia. I worked professionally doing 2d work with a 1660Super 6gb for years. So you could get a 5060 8gb, or a used 3060 12gb, and be completely fine (especially since you mentioned she doesn't game).",Neutral
Intel,That’s what I was thinking however she doesn’t really game as much as she does art and is coming from a old thinkpad laptop so I’m just trying to figure out one what’s worth it to her and myself money wise for me and enjoyment for her,Neutral
Intel,That’s what I’ve decided,Neutral
Intel,I mean if the difference is more than 50$ and she doesn't need the 9060XT then get the A770,Neutral
Intel,Getting the B580,Neutral
Intel,It makes sense. A770 is technically a little faster I think but it was the first generation product and... well the focus is definitely on the B580 (and possible B770 yet to release) as far as driver development etc given it's the current gen product.  It's also a great price for a good general purpose GPU.,Positive
Intel,TrueNAS.  You probably wont need a CPU that powerful. Depends on the game servers though.,Neutral
Intel,11 LTSC,Neutral
Intel,"I started playing Arc Raiders a few days ago with my mate, and I have to say I’m really enjoying it. It’s also refreshing that I can max out all the settings and actually see great performance, unlike most of the standard UE5 slop out there. The devs have really done a great job with the optimisation.",Positive
Intel,"Isn't Helldivers II on a downward trend atm due o the abhorrent (or somehow, more so as of late) performance and crashing issues folks have been having?  I've got a pretty beefy rig and not only is HD2 the only game I've had whole system lock ups on, but it's also the only game I've had in the last decade that's done it with such regularity and it's not my own dumbass fault.",Negative
Intel,"Currently considering buying it.   Tried tarkov, but that's a too steep learning curve for me. (Had to watch a 4min video, just to figure out how to mount a scope lol)   Is it more ""casual"" than tarkov?",Neutral
Intel,I’m impressed. The game is good that’s for sure.,Positive
Intel,Why has extraction games suddenly become popular?   Hunt showdown has been doing it for years and no one seems to care 😂,Negative
Intel,But it’s comparable to hell divers? I really like the game play of hell divers,Positive
Intel,"I maxed out the stash size and it's nearly full. Now I have nothing to sell my goodies for. I don't buy gear. So I guess it's just about how high I can make the numbers go up.  So I stopped playing. I think the addiction broke for me. I get my life back though, so that's a plus.  If there was a system to convert 1000 credits to 1 gold, that would incentivize further play.",Negative
Intel,Not for me. Not a PvP person,Neutral
Intel,Hard pass on extraction shooters.,Neutral
Intel,I'd play it but I don't care for getting killed constantly by griefers,Negative
Intel,"lol you loot addicts, this is the worst type of gaming",Negative
Intel,I enjoy Helldivers more than Arc AIDSers I'm sorry 🤣,Negative
Intel,"Rightly so too I’d say, I’m getting like 300 frames on high settings, talk about well optimised. Gdamn.",Positive
Intel,That’s a shame. I was hoping the extraction shooter fad would end.,Neutral
Intel,Helldivers is dogshit,Neutral
Intel,"Easy anti-cheat: well, forget it.  Just had to deal with uninstalling that hot mess, as it was causing windows update failures, which caused all kinds of issues with other game updates.",Negative
Intel,"Umm, it never “crossed”. It had been 10x of helldivers since launch",Negative
Intel,I have a great time playing it on my steam deck. I'm so grateful that it plays on it.,Positive
Intel,Seriously. It's so sad that so many games release with absolutely no intention of giving people the performance they paid for,Negative
Intel,"Embark's other game, The Finals was also a lot of fun, until I stopped playing a while back. It's still pretty good, based on what I hear from friends.",Positive
Intel,They just stripped features out and used old settings. New features always pushes new tech holy why is everyone like this now. Can PC gaming not push further than what we have? Games scaled even worse back then when tech was doubling every year. If anything we are in a drought as tech is no longer having big gains as the best nvidia and amd can do is make bigger chips and pushing more wattage.   Its not just devs or engines its hardware manufacturers no longer able to keep up. Since every time pc gaming looks to stabilize we get a big boom and something spikes and those prices stay. As of now everything past 2020 is just price gouging that you paid for. Your money to performance is worse than ever before and you paid for it. You should be mad at nvidia with messing with their stacks. Then increasing the prices. Next gen is only to get worse.   The way I see it top end gpus have a harder time keeping up with what unreal 5 wants to do and since nvidia cuts the stack by 40% for the next tier down their is no gains on moving up unless you move up a tier. At the same time devs just dont have the time to optimize cause they dont have infinite money or time. But the better unreal 5 games dont run that bad.   We are so screwed.,Negative
Intel,"I have been having a blast with it and I never play PvP games!  I play solo and everyone has been so friendly. Died a few times to people that shoot at first sight, but that's just part of play a PvPvE game, so no hate to them at all. Really recommend it even for people who would normally avoid this genre.",Negative
Intel,Turns out UE5 games can run great if you basically turn UE5 into UE4,Positive
Intel,"I for one wish the graphics could be pushed further, even maxed out there’s some rough spots. But the game is amazing regardless.",Positive
Intel,Saw a video the other day that essentially said they managed to get reasonable performance out of UE5 by turning most of the features off! Think it was a digital foundry vid.,Neutral
Intel,">It’s also refreshing that I can max out all the settings and actually see great performance, unlike most of the standard UE5 slop out there.  It's because their 'max settings' are more like medium/high on other games. Try turning stuff down.",Positive
Intel,"This article would be comparing the all time peak concurrent figure for the two games, a little under 500,000. But yes Helldivers is in a sorry state right now.",Negative
Intel,imo the game loop got boring  I’m glad Helldivers 2 exists though. I hope they make a Helldivers 3 that’s even better. I’ll play it for sure.,Positive
Intel,"Somewhat, but the community has also been fairly willing to hear them out as they've made some recent commitments to fix things up and reducing file size for PC users. The game has been rock solid stable for me after a weird fix that support recommended though, so I'll pass it along:  Browse the local files on steam. Find the HD2 exe. Select its properties (not the usual properties that W11 wants, show more -> properties) and run it in Windows 8 compatibility mode. Also select the checkbox that runs it as administrator.  This does mean there's one popup thing that happens every time you launch it, but it solved all my crashing issues. The game might run really bad for a few minutes the first time you launch it after changing this, but it clears itself up.",Positive
Intel,"Performance issues are resolved now. Problem is because the devs decided to focus on performance and bug fixes, it's been under a content drought for about 3 months now so playercount is falling.  It was expected from the beginning that if they were to stop making content and focus on bug fixes, playercount would fall which was one of the reasons why AH held it off for so long.  They had to make a choice between maintaining the health of the game at the cost of low numbers for a while versus keep pumping content every month.",Negative
Intel,"Much more casual: no out of round health systems to manage, gear is much more plentiful and there’s less punishment for dying (you still lose your gear but it’s easier to craft) Free loadouts that aren’t on a timer like Tarkov And putting attachments on guns is idiot proof unlike tarkov",Neutral
Intel,Definitely feels like a much more casual Tarkov. It scratches a similar itch and I have been able to groom my more casual friends into playing this game after Tarkov being too much.,Positive
Intel,"I really wasn't a fan of Tarkov. Arc Raiders, on the other hand, might be my GOTY. Way more accessible, looks better, performs better, and the community for the most part, is great. Solos is very chill, I reckon 95% of players are just doing quests or looting.",Positive
Intel,"Way more casual than Tarkov (or anything other extraction ahooter on the market, really). This is why it's so successful. People have been throwing around the term ""extraction shooter for the employed,"" lol.  The game is good fun and if you play solo too. Probably 70% of the people I run into are friendly. I will say that having a mic in this game improves your chances of survival massively.",Positive
Intel,"It’s like tarkov for fortnite players.   Theres only a handful of guns, losing your gear means nothing because you can get free loadouts at any time, most loot is just for crafting or tasks etc.   I like it a lot but it felt a little shallow having come from tarkov, but it’s definitely way more palatable to the average gamer.   Tarkov requires constant focus whereas i can just chill out and goof off in arc",Neutral
Intel,Much more which is why it has been appealing to a wider audience,Negative
Intel,I have been watching a bunch of streams for it lately. Taking up more time than I'd like tbh. Really hope my wife gets it for me for Christmas lol.,Positive
Intel,"HUNT has a very brutal competitive streak, ARC banks on less PvP and encourages a more cooperative gameplay loop.",Neutral
Intel,"Hunt are Tarkov are the only ones that have done in right in that time. It’s not really a new thing, a ton of them have released and failed.  Difference is that Arc is actually doing it well, in a way that’s approachable to more casual players. So it’s blowing up.",Neutral
Intel,I have about 20h in hunt but I wasn't a fan of being 1 tapped. At least in Arc you have a chance to fight back. There is no weapon that can 1 tap you.,Negative
Intel,"In a way, sure.  It’s also not Helldivers at all",Neutral
Intel,"They are both shooters, it stops about there",Neutral
Intel,"My only hesitation is the PVP, getting smoked at extraction because somebody wants your loot would get tiring fast.",Negative
Intel,"In terms of third person, the way PvE works, and the fact that helldivers is also extraction-based, yes. The gameplay and movement is really similar. The addition of PvP makes it quite different however, as well as the absence of airstrikes lol",Neutral
Intel,"Third person, have to extract to be successful, you shoot big ass baddies... could be comparable, yes. LOL",Neutral
Intel,Did you finish your expedition project?,Neutral
Intel,"I was thinking the same, but since the price was accessible, feels like Arc Raiders is a evolution of the formula.  People said the same for turn based games, and Expedition 33 happened.   Never keep your mind close to these things, something always comes around to surprise us. Arc Raider is a damn good surprise so far.",Positive
Intel,I felt the same way but it’s been super fun,Positive
Intel,PVP isn't griefing. It's a part of the game.,Neutral
Intel,Plenty of PvE single player games out there for you bud.,Neutral
Intel,See ya never,Neutral
Intel,You make a fine point. The “ummm” gave me the ick lol,Neutral
Intel,Does it support only deck or works on all distros?,Neutral
Intel,Yeah it’s still a really solid game. They also do a great job with cosmetics and treating the community well,Positive
Intel,"Borderlands 4 runs like dogshit even with optimised settings. It still drops below 100fps with DLSS performance at 4k. Arc Raiders I get 140-170fps on the highest settings. Borderlands 4 doesn’t even look impressive either. I don’t care how they’ve achieved the performance, it’s just a much better experience.",Negative
Intel,"I have 200 hours in Helldivers 2, at a certain point, I just lost interest because it took too long to find super credits to unlock the other warbonds, especially when you have people who run around the map doing their own thing and don't open the two-man locked gates.",Negative
Intel,"I was so into helldivers for the first few months, then I got bored and waited forever for the illuminate to be brought in, and that content turned out to be so incredibly underwhelming that I haven't touched the game since, such a pity because HD2 really felt special and refreshing for those first months.  At least the first game is still awesome and fun.",Positive
Intel,"I'll try that compatibility fix next time I play. Beyond the lockups, my game was running quite well. Not sure why folks are downvoting you, but Reddit do be that way sometimes.",Negative
Intel,"Its been a bit more than 3 months. We've basically had illuminate (4 enemies), cities, bug reskins and a few bots with reused weapons. In 2 years.   They've never exactly been pumping out anything but warbonds and store items, which are also mostly reskins of things we already have and effectively a subscription more expensive than paying for an MMO subscription if you want literally any new equipment, with something like 2 exceptions this year.  Performance is very much not fixed either, its better, but still awful on many tiles and hardlocks are still occurring for many among other long term bugs which remain untouched a year later.  Oh and they joked about lying to the community, then lied to the community, multiple times. I don't understand having faith in devs that literally try to deceive their customers, repeatedly.",Negative
Intel,"Fuck it, bought it",Negative
Intel,"I was looting with 4 other randoms in the same area, like next to each other, one other random decided to open fire in one of us, we killed him and shared the loot, one of the best experiences I had on a extraction shooter.",Positive
Intel,"100% nailed it, while not having the same depth it's definitely made the genre more accessible. Plus I will admit the background/environments are relatively interesting",Positive
Intel,what?,Neutral
Intel,Have probably done 50 runs and only had 1 where it was cooperative. That was because my buddy and I came up on them and could have killed them but chose not too. If I say friendly I’m getting shot every single time,Negative
Intel,"Lmao so do I buy or not smh  Edit - everyone says to go on the Internet and look for myself, have you ever heard of asking somebody for their opinion?  I know a lot of you may not know this, but the information on the Internet even from some of your favorite influencers is very curated or paid for.  The interaction between me and the individual above is a real interaction in his real opinion  Always remember this, when somebody asks you for their opinion.  It’s not because they can’t do the search, it’s because they want an authentic opinion knowing that the Internet is littered with bullshit marketing.",Neutral
Intel,"It really doesn't. They both have a very similar gameplay loop, but Helldivers 2 is PvE exclusively with *far* lower stakes. And also HD2 doesn't use AI voices, for all its other technical flaws.",Negative
Intel,"While I won’t say it doesn’t happen, PvP is a super inefficient way to progress in Arc Raiders. The gameplay far more heavily encourages cooperation between players as opposed to competition, especially when it comes to downing the big Arc",Negative
Intel,I hit 100 hours last night and this has only happened a dozen or so times. Just go next and forget about it. There are ways to mitigate it too. Griefers have not slowed me down in any meaningful capacity.  Don't trust anyone with the stupid orange and black skin,Negative
Intel,Are there pve only servers? That’s how I did wow and I loved it sm,Neutral
Intel,on the PC version I have noticed more players helping each other versus killing each other. like 75/25 helpful/want to kill me.,Neutral
Intel,"Not to mention the entire North Line project, which is loaded with goodies, and just launched last week",Negative
Intel,"No, that's the one thing I can do. If I go back, that's probably what I'll focus on, that and blueprints, and parts for those high end recipes.  It's just a bit sad when money means nothing anymore when it was a big draw.  I think the game progression is balanced around PvP, and as fun as it is to find a ton of high end loot, the new map has too much of it and not enough PvP. It's too easy to get 40-50k of loot and dip playing solo. No one shoots, or at least it's easy enough to spot and avoid players.",Negative
Intel,"""I'd play soccer, but I don't care for getting scored on by griefers""",Negative
Intel,Something a griefer would say,Neutral
Intel,"You misunderstand.  Similar to BR, this trend has caused a lot of devs to waste time on making extraction games or extraction modes for non-extraction games that just end up being a waste of time and money. Look at Battlefield 2042’s attempt at extraction, it ended up being a complete waste of resources.  Plus the complete lack of PvE extraction games is odd. I want to like the genre, but it ***ALWAYS*** just ends up being unemployed players who no-life the game and have best in slot gear stomping new players. I just wanna play the PvE aspect of it. People act like PvE can’t be challenging which is just ignorant.",Negative
Intel,EAC does have issues tbf,Neutral
Intel,It should work on any distro. It works on my vanilla arch installation (btw).,Positive
Intel,"It's still at a class of it's own, but I do agree that all the current updates they're adding is underwhelming. I don't mind more warbonds, but it got to a point where they nerfed the super credit drops and it took too long to unlock anything anymore.",Negative
Intel,"If that doesn't work, it can also be the anticheat. The tools folder includes an uninstaller and reinstaller for it, which should reset that back to defaults as well.",Neutral
Intel,Also you aren't supporting Russia by playing tarkov. So there is that going for you too,Neutral
Intel,He’s been watching a lot of porn.,Neutral
Intel,Duos and Trios are much more hostile. Solos are chill,Neutral
Intel,Do some research man. It’s not like Helldivers at all really. They are 3rd person shooters in a futuristic setting. That’s about where the similarities stop.,Negative
Intel,Lazy as fuck generation,Negative
Intel,Imagine making a decision for yourself lmao,Neutral
Intel,Idk bro go look at gameplay and decide for yourself,Neutral
Intel,I would be surprised if you regretted your purchase.,Neutral
Intel,It's really good.  PvP is there but you can do a pretty good of avoiding it but the constant threat of it is what makes the game excel.  The Bots are really good and well balanced. They can overwhelm you if you're careless but you'll be fine for the most part if you're smart.  It's worth the buy.,Positive
Intel,idc about ai kekw,Neutral
Intel,"That sounds pretty refreshing, I've put a ton of hours into Tarkov and have been big into Hunt lately, I'd love to be able to properly work with other players towards a common goal like that rather than always being on guard. Is there proximity chat in Arc?",Positive
Intel,There is no pve only servers,Neutral
Intel,I'm near the end of that actually. It moves really quick.,Neutral
Intel,You're supposed to use the lvl 3 refiner and condense a stash full of tier 4 weapons and other top gear. Crafting 1 maxed out weapon by itself uses a lot of stash slots worth of materials just by itself.,Neutral
Intel,Tell me you don't understand what griefing is without telling me,Negative
Intel,why dont you play other games then?,Neutral
Intel,The devs said they tried the pve only and said themselves that it was boring,Neutral
Intel,"If you’re looking for a PvE extraction shooter, check out Sulfur. It also has a lot of roguelike elements to it. It’s still in early access, but there’s tons of content there already and it’s very fun",Positive
Intel,"I didn’t misunderstand. The issue you have with extraction shooters is the PvP. That’s why I said there’s plenty of games with just PvE out there for you. I understand there are some shitty extraction shooters out there and a lot of them have been a flash in the pan but to say it’s a “shame” that ARC Raiders is successful is just a dog shit opinion. So many people are having fun and enjoying the game. Even if it isn’t around in a year, people still had fun with a $40 game. Is that really so shameful? You mention BF Firestorm but who cares if AAA studios try and fail. They need a wake up call anyway.   To your final point about about no lifers getting the best gear and stomping all the players with less playtime, I agree this is an issue in some extraction shooters and no developer has cracked the code to remedy that issue. However, if devs stop making these games like you suggest, the code will never be cracked. So again, saying ARC Raiders’ success is a shame is just ridiculous. Also, if you did an iota of research on the game, you’d know it’s easily the most casual friendly extraction shooter out there.",Negative
Intel,"If you think the extraction shooter genre is oversaturated, name at least 5 notable ones besides ARC and Tarkov.  Battle royale on the other hand IS (or was) oversaturated, as even AAA developers tried their hand at it.",Negative
Intel,"Do you know about escape from duckov, Helldivers or Incursion red river? That's probably more your style",Neutral
Intel,"Ah. My bad, i thought it only works on deck,  seems like it supports linux in general, pretty happy to know",Positive
Intel,"Yeah problem is I don’t like the game enough to play solo. So now I just run free kits only. This way when they lose a shield, ammo and grenades it’s a net negative for them if I die. Even better if I kill them.   Prefer ABI and tarkov.",Negative
Intel,"Did You know that marketing always puts their best product forward, that’s why you ask people for their opinions on it because they purchased a product and they’ve experienced it.  If I go online what do I see, a bunch of pre-created marketing material trying to sell me a product. The person above is giving me his honest opinion, something you can’t just find unless you ask for it on the Internet.  So while you claim I’m lazy as fuck, I see you lack critical thinking in perspective and trying to understand why people ask questions and other people for their opinion opinions.  I can tell you’re very easy to sell too, and you’ll probably eat up all the marketing material. So I have at fam spend your money away but don’t criticize people that are looking for opinions from not marketing sources.  Let me guess you think politicians care about you too?",Neutral
Intel,"There is prox chat and it gets pretty well used in my experience. On solos, with cross play off, I’ve found that things go really smooth around other players the vast majority of the time. Very rarely have I had to PvP.",Positive
Intel,Can’t craft tier 4 weapons if you find no fucking weapon blueprints,Negative
Intel,Ah ok. Thank you. I'll work on that then. Cash value was fun but it's not everything,Positive
Intel,That’s a failure on the devs’ part. Tons of compelling PvE games exist and have existed even before multiplayer games existed.,Negative
Intel,"No, you still definitely misunderstood. That’s not the only issue I have and I specifically said that.",Negative
Intel,Helldivers is not an extraction shooter.,Neutral
Intel,Dunno why you were downvoted - it’s ok to have opinions.,Neutral
Intel,"Damn bro, you really wrote all that without realizing you're a clown. Maybe you'll figure out halfway through your next reply, I'm rooting for you.",Negative
Intel,"Bettina is the single most common blueprint in the game. And yes, you can still craft tier 4 weapons without blueprints - Ferro tier 4, Stitcher tier 4, etc...",Neutral
Intel,It’d be boring as pve and would not be popular at all,Neutral
Intel,"you dont like the genre, so dont play it? i dont like puzzle games, i dont play puzzle games. pretty simple.",Neutral
Intel,You say that’s not the only issue you have but I addressed every point you made except for your last line about people claiming PvE can’t be challenging. I’ve literally never seen anyone say that as it makes no sense. Every game was PvE before PvP was even a thing. So you can’t say I am still misunderstanding.   Funny that you chose that response and then didn’t address any of the points I made.,Negative
Intel,How exactly do you leave the map? Next you're gonna tell me you don't shoot.,Negative
Intel,"Again, only because the devs failed at their jobs. Tons of great PvE games exist. And since it’s PvEvP, they really have no excuse for the PvE parts to not be good.",Negative
Intel,If that’s what you wanna tell yourself. You’re not worth arguing with.,Negative
Intel,"That’s not what makes an extraction shooter an extraction shooter. By that logic Titanfall, Warframe, and Deep Rock Galactic are also extraction shooters.  Extraction is all about dropping in, gathering loot, and attempting to escape with that loot. If you fail, you lose that loot and all loot you brought in with you. None of that is true in Helldivers. Sure there’s samples, but you’re not collecting weapons or armor and you don’t lose any weapons or armor you bring in.  Helldivers is a mission-based co-op horde shooter.

Intel,"this shit was fucking with my PC, DDU current drivers and reinstalled 25.10 straight from Gigabyte Program and everything works again",Negative
Intel,getting bsod randomly since 25.9.1 sad..,Negative
Intel,"I started having an issue since the 25.11.1 update with unreal editor where all of my tools menus instantly close, nothing else changed except for this driver update and I've heard of Nvidia having similar issues with driver updates in the past so I think it may be the cause, Going to revert to an older driver and see if it works",Negative
Intel,For me the driver just times out randomly during normal stuff like youtube shorts. Today I opend steam and the driver timed out. That never happend with 25.10.1.,Neutral
Intel,"I've spent the last few days uninstalling, reinstalling, DDUing, doing everything I could think of to get Adrenaline to start/work. It would show the splash screen and then quit. No way of re-starting it. Couldn't open anything that used Vulkan and got errors. Couldn't install the Windows Store version cause ""driver error"". I eventually used DDU one last time and uninstalled everything AMD and was able to just install the driver through MyASUS. Now I'm able to open all the software again that wasn't starting before. I'll be holding off on installing Adrenaline again anytime soon. Sucks cause I want the features, but I couldn't use the programs anyway. I miss having nvidia.",Negative

Intel,So are the issues with Arc Raiders fixed? I had to roll back to 25.9.1 because 25.10.1 kept crashing my game. Did they actually fix it?,Negative
Intel,Disabling ULPS seem to fix the crash. My pc crash pretty often when i wake the screen or turn it on if i dont disable ulps with msi afterburner. 9070xt,Negative
Intel,Doom: The Dark Ages does not lauch with the latest driver. I had to rollback to 25.9.2 in order to play. Please fix,Negative
Intel,Last driver crashes Apex Legends every joined game. Im fuckin over amd.,Negative
Intel,Support for Anno 117: Pax Romana - Incorrect. I have needed to downgrade back to 25.9.2 to play Anno 117: Pax Romana without crashing. The last updates have been a joke. I now cannot use adrenaline due to needing to play on this earlier version to be able to play any new games. Does anyone know of where I can express my complaints?  Edit: This is also the same for Arc Raiders.,Negative
Intel,"Here we go again, jetzt stürzt Battlefield 6 wieder ab. Mit dem Treiber davor hatte ich es in den Griff bekommen außer XMP war aktiviert, dann stürzte es dennoch ab.    Also es scheint definitiv ein AMD Treiber Problem zu sein.    Gut das bei euch die Kunden die Tester sind und nicht ihr das übernehmen müsst.  PS: Gespielt wird mit einer 7900XT und einem 7800X3D.      Das war definitiv meine erste und letzte Karte von AMD. So viel Probleme hatte ich mit Team Grün nicht.",Neutral

Intel,"I have this but on display port, HDMI works fine",Neutral
Intel,"DDU with full uninstall of all AMD related things and then chipset driver install, fresh GPU driver install fixed the crash from wakeup for me.",Neutral
Intel,"I had to go back to version 25.9.2 but I no longer have AMD Adrenalin. If I try to install it, it reinstalls version 25.11, which crashes my game. Is it necessary to have AMD Adrenalin? I have a 7900 XTX and a Ryzen 9 7950X3D.",Negative
Intel,Could you try a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter? I wonder if it works in this situation =D,Neutral
Intel,I have the same issue with display port but it’s okay with hdmi :/,Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, I plan to make sure my next display has Display Port in it. Mostly for linux though.",Positive
Intel,"There will already be branching inside the code of the driver. This has been the case already, to various degrees, for years. It's not new.  It's just whether AMD wants to formally spread those branches out on a file / compilation level and distribute different packages. And then publicly whether they commit to updating all branches of code or only some.  For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch. Of course, we have very little outside insight into the exact spread of these cases that AMD wants to pay their engineers to work on.",Neutral
Intel,There is a separate code path for specific things bit both are in those combine driver. Its mostly about certain ray tracing extensions   There are also fp8 and fp16 codepaths    People misunderstand and thought its like pre rdna stuff.,Neutral
Intel,"V25.10.2  here… I have both CPU and GPU by AMD and if you download the specific package, they install drivers only for the specific hardware (and they have different dimensions). For installing both drivers you have to download the AutoDetect package.  EDIT: typo",Neutral
Intel,"I'm one of the 5 people still running a Vega 64 and for years we've had a separate driver ""branch"" despite being able to install new Adrenaline versions. Bf6 beta wouldn't run without spoofing my actual internally installed driver, which hadn't been updated since they dropped support.",Negative
Intel,combined again it looks like 🤷‍♂️,Neutral
Intel,the display team are working on this with priority. Hoping to have this out in the next release. There are two similar display issues on their radar which are both P1.,Neutral

Intel,"Are y'all playing on televisions? HDMI isn't really optimal for modern monitors, with DisplayPort being the better spec for computer graphics.  Not criticizing, just curious as to use-case.",Neutral
Intel,"Same here, but oddly enough I use modded 25.9.1 drivers",Neutral
Intel,You try install last chipset driver ?,Neutral
Intel,"Bummer you're having issues. Hopefully AMD gets it straightened out for you. Out of curiosity, why did you decide to use HDMI on your monitor instead of display port? I thought HDMI was mostly used for TVs nowadays.",Negative
Intel,So it's the driver that's why that happens 😡 and it's not fixed?,Negative
Intel,Thank you for your service,Positive
Intel,"I've had the ""device_hung"" error and the best drivers are those you are on.   AMD needs a lot of help with their drivers...",Negative
Intel,Any update mate?,Neutral
Intel,"No, radeon drivers update cannot upgrade your CPU so that it would stop bottlenecking your GPU.",Negative
Intel,"yeah same, my experience with 25.10 was terrible, had to DDU it once to get back my CPU metrics in Adrenalin, then DDU’d it again to go back to 25.9.2 since games were stuttering.",Negative
Intel,Same.,Neutral
Intel,"Not stable, ddu install 11.1 and lag in old dx11 mmo game(BDO)  Same as 10.2, 9800x3d with 7900xtx, i can keep 144fps in town , 11.1like  fps 60-65 and lag spikes  Im go back to 9.1",Negative

Intel,I'm playing it on 7900 GRE with FSR4 INT8 with no issues.,Positive
Intel,na it works the problem only occures when using PathTracing and you are not going to play on an AMD card with PT anyways and especially not a 7700XT,Negative
Intel,"I played recently the latest patch of Cyberpunk 2077 with RX 7700 XT with drivers from February this year, 25.2.1 and had no issues, no stutter, no lag, no crashes, the problem is with path tracing or ray tracing something, you don't have to use that even and it lowers fps probably for very little visual gain.",Positive
Intel,If it still crashes set RTX Global Illumination to Static.,Negative
Intel,"pretty sure anti lag was causing my system to freeze up when in arc raiders on 25.10. turned it on and issues, turned it off and haven't had issues since",Negative
Intel,"Optimizing has nothing to do with fixing crashing, generally, that would be bug fixing.",Negative
Intel,"The only Redstone component that will work through the driver for upgrading existing features (like FSR3 FG) will be ML FG, but only for games that have FSR 3.1.4+(and FSR FG), as they’ve already announced in a GPUOpen article quite a while ago.   Ray Regeneration (RR) and Neural Radiance Cache (NRC) require dev implementation since they’re much deeper in engine code/inputs.",Neutral

Intel,"Itll probably work through optiscaler, but a game like indiana jones has locked dlss inputs, so you need dev implementation",Neutral
Intel,"And all my USB devices dropped for a while, far worse experience than the usual double screen flicker & it's done.  Edit: seems like that was because of iGPU driver for my Zen4. In the end and after 6+ reinstalls, I'm stopping on 25.9.1 and have Vulkan working again.",Negative

Intel,"Most likely when your distro provides a kernel update.  I'd give this a quick read: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-update-and-see-what-graphics-driver-you-have-on-linux-and-steamos/  Pretty much the default is that you will be using the Mesa driver collection and they were last updated yesterday.  The fixes there do not correlate with the ones in this thread (I think).  As long as you are on a ""cutting edge"" type distro then you can expect that update in the next few days/weeks.  If you are on a ""stable"" distro that doesn't update often, you may be waiting a realllly long time.",Neutral
Intel,"Get what exactly? Features? Bug fixes? Optimizations?   Every 2 weeks there are new Mesa driver updates with bug fixes and performance optimizations. As for features, you have to wait a few months for versions with big numbers (25.2 is soon updating to 25.3, adding Anti-lag 2).   Depending on your distribution, you can get these updates faster or slower.",Neutral
Intel,"Linux doesn’t work like windows. You get updates directly via Mesa stack. When your distro provides mesa package update, that’s when you get driver updates, and they’re completely different from windows branch.",Neutral
Intel,just uninstall it I prefer manual check myself.,Neutral
Intel,So AMDs default driver overclocks and doesn’t reflect that in the values?,Neutral
Intel,ok it is still crashing ... complete reboot :(,Negative
Intel,"I feel like that crash is more on DICE's side, since Nvidia users get the same exact crash, although less often.  I tried everything I saw on the internet, nothing really works. Sometimes I can play for hours on end, other time game just crashes randomly after 10-15 minutes.  I am going to try to downgrade to 25.9.1 and see how it fares, since I remember that driver being really stable for me (6800XT).",Negative
Intel,Okay.,Neutral
Intel,I’m hoping Valve’s new steam machine will push them on that since it’s RDNA3 based.,Neutral
Intel,The RT/PT reflections leading to CTDs issue? We're working with CDPR to resolve this - it's not caused by the driver software.,Neutral
Intel,"Stuff like this is honestly bugging me.  First AMD card and while it is okay to have some driver issues, stuff like that shouldn't be a thing at all. It can't be that some bugs keep existing for multiple months let alone more than half a year.",Negative
Intel,A much more fundamental thing like playing video in a window without stuttering took 3 or 4 driver updates.,Neutral

Intel,welcome to amd,Neutral
Intel,Yeah hoping it works. I guess the point about crashing with easy anticheat was the fix? Doesn't specifically mention but it was with raytracing enabled I was getting the crash. I suppose we shall find out.,Neutral
Intel,"Weird. I was running 10.2 and things were running fine for the most part. I kept getting a pop-up on launch saying there was a known issue with that driver and Arc Raiders though, so I rolled it back to 9.2 and had more issues on that release than the one with the stated problems.  My fan control profile broke and stopped tracking gpu temp so last night I did a clean DDU install back to 10.2.  Of course 12 hrs later the new release drops haha  Hopefully Fan Control continues to play nice if I just update",Negative
Intel,Same. Never even had Ryzen master installed.,Negative
Intel,"I'm receiving the same error in Event Viewer, but I have installed Ryzen Master. Most likely it's also a component of the Adrenalin drivers for system tuning and monitoring.

Intel,Suggest if you are using powertoys to stop... After their last game update it was crashing left and right. Powertoys was cause. I only crashed once and I believe it was cfeen blanking was cause for that. I was away too long.,Negative
Intel,"Fps drop over time? That's a game issue, it's got a memory leak",Negative
Intel,"What kind of FPS drops? I was having dog shit frame pacing, and hardcore drops to like sub 60 FPS at 1440p medium/high with a 6950XT. I went through every setting and found that anti-lag was the culprit. Once I turned that off it all went away. Then with future frame rendering it got even smoother.

Intel,are you able to install driver only with the newest drivers? When i choose minimal or driver only it still install full version of the software anyway. Only 25.9.1 works perfectly.,Neutral
Intel,Yeah... it can happen. I was already locked outside windows after a bsod with my old nvidia card. I had to use a linux usb drive to fix it through the command line.,Negative

It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.

Intel,Ohh okay. Yeah I don't use any of that lol. Hopefully it won't give me any issues. Plan on playing it after FF7Rebirth.,Neutral
Intel,I tried that before and amd antilag off. I tried all the suggestions.   Been really happy with Bazzite so haven't been back in windows for 2 weeks,Positive
Intel,I tried that and all the other suggestions at the time. Nothing worked.  I'm running the game in Linux now and have 0 issues. I can't even crash it when I try,Neutral

Intel,Pink path tracing and crashing after a few minuets of gameplay. If you don't enable path tracing the game seems to work just fine.,Neutral
Intel,What are you seeing? I played last night on latest driver and everything seemed fine to me. Playing Ultra RT with Auto on FSR4.,Neutral
Intel,"Yes, modern AMD cards use various telemetrics to push past the rated max boost frequency when headroom is available. Even on default. Problem is, not every board runs stable under these circumstances...  This issue is known to AMD but they don't seem to care.",Negative
Intel,"Have you tried undervolting your GPU?

Intel,Either launch with curseforge or rollback,Neutral
Intel,"Damn, didn’t work for me last driver either. I can get FSR4 to work in other games just not BF6",Negative
Intel,"Even the rollback doesn't fix it for me now. It being related to the combination of iGPU and GPU makes sense though. Sadly I actively use the iGPU, so thats not an option for me.",Negative
Intel,"Possible I had not any freezing till 9.1 and rollng back to 8.1 solved the problem.  Yet, I don't use any rare hardware. The rig is formed of most common brands and models. So there is something wrong with the driver.",Negative
Intel,You 100 procent sure on this?,Neutral
Intel,I went back to 25.3 official gigabyte latest driver for 9070XT OC gaming and 2 days no crashes for now. Also changed HDMI for DP cable  I will also change in BIOS and completely disable integrated GPU in BIOS,Positive
Intel,"I had auto update on (my mistake), so it did install over the previous driver. I've downgraded for now and it seems to be working just fine.  But no, after uninstalling from control panel I booted into safe mod and used DDU.   Then I downloaded the newest installer from the website. Restarting where needed during this process.

Intel,Does fsr 4 work on 25.9.1? I thought the only driver that works without having to change any files and risk a ban online is 23. 9.1?,Neutral
Intel,"I had to rollback to driver 25.9.1, start up Star Citizen, switch the renderer to Vulkan, exit game, start SC again to verify it's working with Vulkan, then reinstall the latest driver again. Now it works, just don't switch it back to DirectX. No idea who dropped the ball on this one but Easy-Anticheat sure doesn't like the atidxx64.dll.",Neutral
Intel,I'm not sure. However when I install the driver it states that I cannot use adrenaline and gives me a link to the newest driver. Wondering if there is an earlier version of adrenaline I need to install.,Neutral
Intel,What do you mean extension update??? Do you mean lg firmware update or something Ina  windows update? Where do I find this?,Neutral
Intel,They do not.,Neutral
Intel,"Well, I used the system before the latest updates normally, for maybe half a year. Installed every update without DDU. I wanted to triple boot, formated the drive, left windows to install stock updates and drivers, went to install chipset and GPU driver and voila, every wakeup, just before I could type the pin, kernel panic and shutdown. DDU, just the driver, installed again, black screen. Went into DDU again, wanted to see if I missed anything and without reading, uninstalled everything AMD related, went into windows, installed chipset drivers from vendors site (ASUS) and then the latest GPU drivers, and havent had issues. I have a monitor connected via DP and a TV via HDMI.",Neutral
Intel,Dont buy an adapter. Most of them are trash and dont put out the advertised resolution and refresh rate. Not to mention most of them dont support vrr or HDR.,Negative

Intel,"Yes, I’m talking about 25.10.2 (posted the other day here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/s/nNunS1QlFX ). If you go to AMD download page and select “GPU” you get a file that has a different dimension from the one you download if you choose “CPU”. If you do the following steps 1) DDU (or AMD CleanUp Utility), 2) install CPU drivers => GPU not recognized or with a generic driver. If the you install the GPU driver you get the GPU correctly recognized and a yellow esclamation mark on the integrated. To have both VGAs working at the same time I have to download the AMD Auto Detect package (the file name ends with “minimal_install), but Adrenalin App does not open.",Neutral
Intel,Thank you for explaining it before the rage baiters go nuts.,Neutral
Intel,I've been following this one pretty closely. Unfortunately the fix *just* missed 25.11.1 release cycle; we hope to get this out in the next one.,Negative
Intel,"I have a 7900XTX and have this issue at times. It normally clears quickly on its own, but seeing pink pixels on the screen worried me that I had an issue with the actual hardware",Negative
Intel,"I totally understand. if you're running with an affected display config, you should be fine on 25.9.1 or the 25.10.1 preview driver for BF6. We'll get this out as soon as we can.",Neutral
Intel,"Appreciate you reaching out with this - that's an interesting data point to consider.  In this case, the quirky behaviour with HDMI 2.1 + FRL was attributed to a change made in the display stack, I don't think it explicitly involves display stream compression to repro, just high enough display bandwidth (though I could be mistaken)",Positive
Intel,"Interesting. I've been experiencing random BSODs on my PC too on a fresh Win11 install too, I was also suspecting it was something to do with auto HDR toggle but I didn't know for sure.  I'm running 180hz 1440 LG panel but I don't recall if it's using hdmi or DP. I've also never experienced BSODs until the last week or two, since i did a fresh install and I've had the same monitors/PCs for a long time.",Neutral

Intel,Already launched in COD 7,Neutral
Intel,"Im currently using dp 1.4 on my 7900 gre.  My monitor has 2.1 hdmi, so you’re saying i shoulf switch to hdmi?",Neutral
Intel,Some of us are using DP 2.1 though. DP 1.4 is a thing of the past.,Neutral
Intel,Are you sure? The steam machine has HDMI 2.0 and DP 1.4 listed in the specifications,Neutral
Intel,"Ah ok, that definitely makes sense if you're using a TV. Hope they straighten it out for you soon.",Neutral
Intel,What I did is get the 25.8.1 drivers shut off the fluid motion frames and in Windows set bf6 to run full power on your graphics card. Try some of those things and see if that helps you.,Neutral
Intel,"I tried to reinstall the chipset drivers, the same error, tried to install the drivers from gigabyte site the second screen worked but uninstalled adrenaline and it ran the auto update that disabled the secondary screen and the issue of no adrenaline opening came back, going back to older version, thanks AMD",Neutral

Intel,"Wait until December, there's the 5th anniversary and they'll supposedly drop something new.",Neutral
Intel,For me playing it with path tracing on eventually the game crashes. Had no issues playing with ray tracing: psycho though.,Negative
Intel,Amen to that. Not a single crash since the game released on CachyOS. (9070 XT),Positive
Intel,Thank you! Exciting keen to see what it’s like,Positive
Intel,"It has nothing to do with the lack of vulkan support, even when fsr4 comes to vulkan, the game still needs ray regeneration implementation from the devs, you cant use optiscaler through dlss inputs, like you probably will be able to in fx alan wake 2",Negative
Intel,I suppose is going to be fixed as soon as Amd Redstone go out. Basically is going to add every tecnology that Path tracing needs to work. Off course the devs would have to implement them in the game too,Neutral
Intel,"The issue is if you try to use path tracing. Which to be fair, you probably shouldn't unless the miracle of them getting Virtuous to implement Ray Regeneration in Cyberpunk happens.",Negative
Intel,yes i tried it ... maybe it is because of the 7800X3D ... i really dont know... i will wait for the next patch ... should come tomorrow 18.11. ... but i have read so many threads and i am not the only one...,Neutral
Intel,Hmm fair. For me on 9070XT if I had raytracing enabled it would crash most regularly on loading back to the menu after extraction which was annoying but at least not game destroying lol. But yeah annoying enough that I turned RT off entirely.   I hope this means I can turn it back on because the game runs well enough for it.,Negative
Intel,"My last two processors are ryzen amd, my last three video cards are amd radeon and next one will be amd also, nvidia has driver issues as well, to be honest.  But yes, some issues are too annoying and updating drivers is lottery at this point. I would advice against updating drivers unless you need it for specific new game or have the latest video cards - rx 9070 \[xt\]  or 9060 xt .  I should have sold the 7700 xt and bought 9060 xt 16gb instead but too late for that now and it has problems as well, so lottery as i said, its a risk.",Negative

Intel,Which driver version and does it still crashing?,Neutral
Intel,OK I will install it now and test it and get back to you. Give me 10 mins.,Neutral
Intel,Yuppp. It does not work on bf6 but it works on ark survival ascended for me. Seems it might be a bf issue. I saw ppl saying they were getting more fps with this driver in BF6 but I think they didn't realize it's using FSR 3.1 and not 4.,Negative
Intel,Try using DDU to uninstall your current drivers and do a clean install of the 25.10.2 combined drivers if you havent already (you can find it here):  https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-25-10-2.html,Neutral
Intel,"Yup just need to say ""No""",Neutral
Intel,"whew thanks, good think i noticed it first before updating. i have 25.10.2 and 25.9.2 here and they both have windows 10 along their filename so i might as well asked.",Positive
Intel,I don't see how it would work on 23.9.1 lol,Negative
Intel,"Did you use DDU to uninstall the drivers and then reinstall using a driver installer from the AMD website? I found this guide yesterday and it was extremely helpful, specifically step 8:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1lnxb8o/ultimate_amd_performance_fix_guide_stop_lag_fps/",Positive
Intel,I did it this morning before the new driver and confirm chipset drivers were untouched,Neutral
Intel,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.  More people use HDMI than what people think and those TVs don’t always have a DP connector at all.,Negative
Intel,"ah, that explains it. Thanks. :)",Positive
Intel,"What if one does not check release notes? V25.10.2 point to different packages, for installing both CPU and GPU you had to download the AutoDetect package (named “minimal install”). Obviously I’m referring to AMD driver download page.",Neutral
Intel,"Okay, as long as they have a workaround for that... I was planning to get a 9060XT, but also keep my 6700XT for lossless scaling frame gen, was worried the branching would affect that..",Neutral
Intel,"What a mess. I have rdna2 and 3 on the same PC, so combined driver is the solution for this? Or auto detect is the only way?",Negative
Intel,"Damn, that's a huge relief to hear. Most of the frustration came from not knowing whether the issue was even acknowledged.   Thanks a lot for the update.",Positive
Intel,What about Noise Suppression not working since 25.9.2?,Negative
Intel,Finally. The last driver without pink artifacting was 25.4.1  It has been 7 months. AMD Matt acknowledged the bug on [the amd forums](https://pcforum.amd.com/s/question/0D5KZ000011WpJJ0A0/pink-square-artifacting-chrome-discord-and-steam) 5 months ago.  Please let it be fixed with the next driver update. So many 7000series users are on the verge of swapping to Nvidia.  https://i.redd.it/ywrg9at3lp1g1.gif,Neutral
Intel,"what about whatever changed post 25.3.1 for multi monitors? Any driver 25.3.1 and older i can run my main at 200hz, my side at 165, and my third at 60 without issue. Any driver newer than 25.3.1 and running my main at 200hz then playing a game will cause the second monitor (165hz) to flicker, glitch, and freak out the entire time, until the game on the main monitor is closed. Dropping to 165 on the main monitor down from 200hz \*fixes\* the issue but, i paid for 200hz and would like to be able to actually use it again.  (7700xt system)",Neutral
Intel,Hell yeah 🙂 amd I appreciate you see the issues Iv been a fan boy for a long time and I know it will be fixed,Positive
Intel,"Hi. Sorry, I thought this was pretty common as I've had this issue with two different systems and 3 AMD GPUs across 2 generations. [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1jayump/chrome_full_screen_freezes_after_switching_to_amd/) [Or here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/3890720/parts-of-screen-freezes-when-using-chrome) Chrome (or other Chromium browsers, I've had this happen with Edge too) in fullscreen, with graphics acceleration enabled.   Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind this only actually matters if one protocol or the other is **actually** limiting bandwidth for the [resolution * FPS] you want to display on your monitor  For instance, DP 1.4 can do ~25Gbits/s, which translates to roughly 1440p @ 240fps, or 4k @ 120fps  If you have proper cable into HDMI 2.1, it should be able to do ~42Gbits/s, which would instead be 4k @ 190fps  Read up the wikipedia tables for bandwidth specs and resolution / fps / bit depth rates for more",Neutral
Intel,Yeah most people are still have dp 1.4 monitors though. No way I'm swapping my monitor just for dp 2.1 as it's just too awesome. Although these tandem OLED screens look interesting... Hmm lol,Positive

Intel,Cool. Thank you,Positive
Intel,I might turn on ray tracing in like a medium or low setting just for shits and giggles or screenshots but I don't plan on playing with it on all the time since I'll also play at 1440p so I don't wanna have a really bad experience 😖,Negative
Intel,Exactly! It's insane. I can't believe running through a translation layer is more stable than running native,Positive
Intel,"but i dont know something is also wrong with 25.11.1 ... AMD Adrenalin randomly vanishes from tray     i dont want to roll back to 25.9.1 :-(    but this version was the last which was good so far      maybe when we have luck amd is able to provide next time a ""perfect"" driver without any issues?",Negative
Intel,"Could be it, nothing hardware wise at all and just software too.     Yeah, you're not the 1st I've read that says they have issues on the game.     If you're crashing and the system reboots it does make me think of some stability issues and not really just GPU, but I'm guessing you've already tried stability tests and using the system without OC+A-XMP/EXPO disabled.     Once upon a time I remember reading some people, on other instances and other games, having crashes like that (complete reboot) due to PSU instability as well.     Good luck!",Neutral
Intel,That's strange. My game defaulted to everything maxed out including running ray tracing and I haven't noticed any issues. The game runs incredibly well.  I've got a 5800X3D & 9070XT as well.,Positive
Intel,"Fair enough, and yeah sooner the better for all of us",Positive
Intel,It absolutely could be.  Europe has some pretty good consumer law and promising features that could impact your purchase decision are part of this law.  It can fall under misleading advertisement,Neutral
Intel,"It's not freezing, it's just that the GPU usage is practically at 100% all the time, even with V-Sync enabled. With the 25.9 drivers, this doesn't happen, and the clock speed varies normally, increasing and decreasing as needed when V-Sync is enabled. These 25.10 drivers are causing the GPU to consume more energy unnecessarily.",Neutral

Intel,"im running 25.11.1 on win10 7900xt. no problems besides afmf2 breaking the performance overlay, which ive had for multiple updates now",Neutral

Intel,Thank you for this. This was very helpful. Got adrenaline working fine now.,Positive
Intel,"I wish my LG C4 42"" had a display port. Its my primary monitor.",Positive
Intel,"Yep, AMD is not so quick in fixing their driver download page, I still can remember when X870E chipset came out but you found only X670 option. The drivers were the same, but man it’s your flagship chipset! Anyway, drivers install but Adrenalin App does not work for me… and have zero time to reinstall Windows.",Negative
Intel,"I feel like AMD can do a bit of a better job communicating this, despite Vik's great efforts in this subreddit. Just saying: hey guys, we know about this, it sucks, bear with us please can make things better in the long run in my opinion.",Neutral
Intel,"We've not observed anything like this internally, and I've personally not seen this at all in the field. This one may be specific to your display combination.

Intel,Can you tell us what content you have on the secondary panel when it starts misbehaving? Is this behaviour affected if you disable VRR on it too?,Neutral
Intel,"I see. I recall the partial display freeze being related to DWM & multi plane overlay in Windows.

Intel,"Nope, that didn't fix it. Chrome continues to forget to update its display. And WoW continues to crash in the background leading to massive stutters when panning the camera around quickly, along with plenty of other odd behaviours.",Negative
Intel,"Yeah, I'm facing the same issue on RX 9060 XT   Is it a GPU driver issue, or a Windows issue that Microsoft needs to fix?",Negative
Intel,"That's not how it works. Small print won't save you from stuff like this, you think that they can stop releasing this software for 2-3 years because some small print said 'Subject to change'?   European consumer law would absolutely support the consumer in this case. If you promise a feature by a certain date, you will need to deliver it.

Intel,"You have always been able to do something like this! Though cross manufacturer has not had ""benefits"" until Vulkan in some spaces for games, now lossless scaling, but for anything requiring VRAM or software level rendering, it's been there as an option.

Intel,"Works in Windows too. But Windows has way too much overhead for all of the AI garbage, ads and integrated spyware running in the background to still be a usable operating system. Linux is much better.   The drivers install all side-by-side, and all GPUs show up as OpenCL devices. In the software you can then select which one to run on.   FluidX3D can select multiple OpenCL devices at once, each holding only one part of the simulation box in its VRAM. So VRAM of the GPUs is pooled together, with communication happening over PCIe.",Neutral

Intel,"Technically FluidX3D uses neither SLI nor Crossfire, but cross-vendor multi-GPU instead, for domain decomposition of a Cartesian grid simulation box, to hold larger fluid simulations in the pooled VRAM.   The rendering is done multi-GPU too, as domain decomposition rendering. Each GPU knows only a part of the whole fluid simulation box in VRAM and can't see the others. It only renders its own domain, at 3D offset, to its own frame with accompanying z-buffer, and copies those to CPU over PCIe. The CPU then overlays the frames.",Neutral

Intel,"Yes, but SLI is a bad description for it.",Negative
Intel,"The faster PCIe 4.0/5.0 and future iterations mean that dedicated SLI/Crossfire bridges are obsolete. The PCIe bandwidth nowadays is more than enough. And PCIe is the generic industry standard interface, easier to program for than proprietary hardware that's different for every vendor.   For games multi-GPU is gone for good (too few users, too large cost of development, no return of investment for game Studios). But in simulation/HPC/AI software multi-GPU is very common as it allows to go beyond the VRAM capacity of a single large GPU for cheaper.",Neutral
Intel,"sli/crossfire were killed for good reason, its just a bad time all around if half of your gpu's core/cache is located a foot away from the other half, unless your baseline performance is so damn low that the microstutters just get lost in the noise.  ultimately chiplet cpu/gpu designs are basically just an evolved form of sli/crossfire, and we're happily starting to get quite good at those.

Intel,"indeed it did, if only game devs adopted this more. Then again, the idea of two high end GPUs like we have today in a single PC is kinda horrifying.",Negative

PC will perform the best if OS is located on the closest one.   Much better off just slapping two GPUs together in a single form factor than two separate GPUs.

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative
Intel,One thing I appreciate about AMD is having the lowest CPU overhead for their graphics drivers. Makes a difference if you're CPU limited in a game.,Positive
Intel,So Nvidia now has the lowest driver overhead? Seems like they took the HUB video seriously,Neutral
Intel,So the money you save on a GPU you will need to spend on a better CPU??  Might as well get a faster GPU.,Negative
Intel,Interesting that B580 doesn't look bad at all with a 13600k. I wonder what it's like with a 13400 or 12600k. It seems like just having those extra threads provided by the e-cores takes care of the overhead it needs.,Positive

Intel,"No, they do not.  The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software.  They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  The main example that seems to suggest otherwise is actually a demonstration of nVidia's forced threading of DX11 games, which can increase performance despite the increased overhead it entails, when the CPU has enough headroom overall (i.e. it doesn't eat into the single-thread performance).",Negative
Intel,"Lowest with DX11 and older, but not with the newer APIs",Neutral
Intel,And when is the last time HUB did a dedicated video showing the improvement in overhead?,Neutral
Intel,or it's just a cache/memory access issue,Neutral

I think this will be great for non-gaming purposes, like Adobe, Autodesk and so on. 890M should be a photo editing powerhouse.",Positive
Intel,"I mean current consoles are already APU power houses, they can give you 120fps depending on the game, and 30-60fps depending on what mode you select.

Intel,"Radeon iGPUs are mostly limited by the shared RAM bandwidth. I was thinking of getting an 8700G a little while ago, and the benchmarks varied wildly depending on RAM frequency and overclocks.  Maybe they'll improve it by hooking it up to a wider GDDR bus in laptops, similar to how the current PS5 and Xboxes work (IIRC?)",Neutral
Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks. Intel is already moving on it and I think the main thing holding AMD back is that they rely on 3rd parties for memory packaging so the capacity goes to the more lucrative enterprise chips first.",Neutral
Intel,"The iGPU uplift is extremely underwhelming, I guess this is why Asus did the ROG Ally X model instead of waiting for these chips. I wouldnt be surprised if Lunar Lake with Xe2 passes Zen 5's iGPU at lower power levels, at higher ones im sure RNDA 3.5 will be ahead.",Negative

Nearly all of the configs that release of 16cu Point APU or 40cu Halo will be an APU slapped in a chassis without an adequate power or memory bandwidth setup for the igpu.     What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra.

They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative
Intel,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",Negative

If Intel can be competitive in the budget market it will at least put a fire under amd to lower their prices/make a better valued product.",Negative
Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't. Problems that Nvidia and AMD both solved decades ago that are holding Intel back in 2024.   It's not a mystery how a GPU should be built but that didn't stop Intel from not figuring it out.,Neutral
Intel,"Installs beta software, proceeds to complain about it",Neutral
Intel,Doesn't make it less of a fact that users are experiencing issues and they still paid hard cash for those GPUs.,Negative
Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral
Intel,"This was a graphics card, not a ‘GPU’ in terms that we understand them now, just to bolster the point about how much of a disparity this comparison reveals.",Negative
Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so? They paid full price for a product and it should work as advertised.  With that said, the issues with Arc are widely known and complaining about it after the fact is a bit sillly at this point.",Negative

It makes me wonder if they have used older drivers, since they don;t even get 60fps rasterized at 1080p in some games.  edit: And I paid much less than the minimum price they are listing, I'd need to check if prices went up - even though computer base suggest that isn't the case.

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Intel,"And I'm over here struggling to keep an Nvidia T4 passthrough to work reliably on Hyper-V to Ubuntu 22.04. :(  Is there a specific software combination that works more reliably than others?   Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.

Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.  You're free to guess what vendor om looking at to replace my CPU with. Damn shame really.",Negative
Intel,"Fact: AMD does not give a shit about any of this.   We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line. If all CDNA customers switch to NVIDIA and those PO's dropped in volume, it might make them care a little bit.",Negative

Intel,"I’ve been buying ATI / AMD since the ATI Rage 128, and I think my next GPU will be Nvidia. I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.  Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical. I guess that's why nobody is already doing it.",Neutral

I think they're the defense of a brand like it they are defending their sports club.  We're stuck between the overpriced that just work, and the nightmare the AMD software overall is. I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?

Not because I have something against this brand or the other, but because we need competitors, or else you'll end up paying 600$ for a nice system, and 6000$ for the GPU.

My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

Intel,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

Intel,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place. And if this is a feature that they do not want to support, having the documentation needed to self-support the feature.",Negative

As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it.

Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Until I made my prior posts here on r/AMD, AMD were not interested or even awake when it came to these issues. I have had direct correspondence with John Bridgman where he confirmed that GPU reset was not even considered in prior generations.

My gaming stability issues were always caused by unstable RAM timings and CPU OC settings - since I upgraded to an AM5 platform with everything stock, I'm solid as a rock.

From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.  Does AMD need to improve things?  Of course.

I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.

I'd rather turn RT off, as I did in Control (for AMD and Nvidia HW), which actually has decent RT effects.",Negative

Intel,"Oh wow, this is probably the first time I'm seeing dual channel listed in the RAM section of specs requirements.",Positive
Intel,im more baffled as to why they are comparing a RX 5700 to a GTX 1070. Id have thought they would have said a RX 590 (instead of 5700) or RTX 2060 (instead of 1070),Negative
Intel,> Enthusiast   > 1440p [...] with FSR Quality [...] 60 FPS  1440p + xxxx Quality upscaling is just another way to say 1080p you cowards. It's 2023 and enthusiast level is 1080p @ 60 FPS.   Looks pretty though with the amount of vegetation.  I'm surprised that they put the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT side by side in a game that has forced ray tracing. I guess that's the advantage of being cross platform and AMD sponsored.,Neutral

Intel,This gives me hope that Star Wars outlaws will also have FSR 3. 🤌,Negative
Intel,60fps with balanced upscaling on a 4080/7900xtx … That’s not a good sign,Negative
Intel,It's joever. We are officially at the point where devs are using upscaling as the standard to reach playable frame rates instead of optimizing their games.,Negative
Intel,"If you look in the top right, these seem to be based on ray tracing being enabled? If that is the case, these specs actually seem reasonable.",Neutral
Intel,"FSR and DLSS were supposed to be optional, now they seem to be mandatory in any graphics setup.",Neutral

Intel,"Really disliking this trend of all new games having ""with FSR/DLSS"" in their PC requirements tables. The requirements should all be done without any upscaling or frame generation tech to be upfront and honest about how the game will run. Upscaling will then just be an available option for users to further increase performance.",Negative
Intel,"Actually not to bad for current standards, 1440p 60 with fsr quality on a 6800xt/3080 is great if high includes RT, if it doesn't then it sucks",Negative
Intel,"So with my 6800xt, which should be able to do 1440p high settings at over 60fps easily, I'll have to use FSR just to get 60fps? Great, another unoptimized game headed our way.  So sick of the awful PC ports and such. 6800xt is still a very powerful card yet I'm seeing more and more games require it for 1440p 60fps high or even 1080p 60 fps high. Ridiculous.  The reliance on upscaling tech instead of properly optimizing the game is becoming a problem. And it seems this game has forced RT which is idiotic. RT destroys performance and should always be an option.",Negative
Intel,"If you notice, all the mentioned AMD GPUs are significantly better than Nvidia GPUs, so does that mean bad performance for AMD GPUs?",Neutral
Intel,So i bought an 1200€ card (rx 7900xtx in my region and at the time of launch) and can now enjoy new games at 60 fps with BALANCED fsr upscaling. We love to see it. /s,Positive
Intel,so I'm doomed to use FSR even at 1080p ? what a shame pc gaming has become.,Negative
Intel,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?  (I'm not talking about this game in particular, just in general, it was same outrage w/ AW2 and that turned out better than expected)",Neutral
Intel,I hope they will bundle this game with CPUs/GPUs,Neutral
Intel,holy hell so for 1080p you need a 1440p card because not even a RX 7600 is on par with a 3060ti or a 6700XT,Negative
Intel,Recently upgraded GPU and CPU and crazy that newer games are already requiring the newest GPUs to play them. Personally I don't think it's a horrible thing but at the same time it just screams horrible optimization.,Negative
Intel,This game better look like real life with those specs. I does looks beautiful!,Positive
Intel,"Another garbage with forced upscaling at baseline. When upscaling winded up - everyone was ""Hell yeah, high refresh rate AAA gaming""  Fast forward to today: ""FSR performance just to hit 1080p 60fps - yay..""   I fucking knew it.. it was so obvious upscaling will turn into this and replace game optimizations. Why optimizing shit, when you can tell people to turn on fucking FSR / DLSS / XeSS performance??   What a fucking shitshow... And few weeks back when I said I'm not gonna buy AMD GPU again because upscaling is getting mandatory and DLSS is just objectively superior - I was laughed in the face. Every major AAA game onwards will be shoving up upscaling as base line performance - so your typical 60fps marks (and 30fps - yes apparently that is still a thing on PC in 2023). There's no escape from this.",Negative
Intel,Damn. My 5700XT did Mirage fine on Medium/Low shadows. Now its basement quality.,Negative

With this being a based on a movie game, I don’t have super high hopes that that’ll be the case though. Going from movie to game and vice versa almost always has bad results.   Also, displaying system requirements with upscaling is a bad joke. This is basically saying you’re not getting native 1080p 60fps without a 6800xt or 3080. Upscaling is definitely becoming the crutch a lot of folks feared it would be.",Negative

Intel,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",Neutral

Now, it's being proven right in our faces that companies are no longer making 100% they're making 45% done games, and then they rely on upscaling and fake frames to do the rest.   Why have a fully optimized game that runs well natively when you can just lower the resolution by 3x then have frame generation help?   Full force ahead to frame generation= Every game will be optimized so badly that you're forced to upscale",Negative
Intel,"It’s literally right there in the hardware specs. 1080p fsr2 quality is 720p input resolution, so at native the game runs at 720p low on a 1070 or 5700.  It is the inverse of what reviewers have been doing with their benchmarks - if you are a fan who really has a stick up their ass about native res, just do the math yourself. They’ve given you all the pieces you need to calculate it out yourself, but that’s not how the game is supposed to be run so they aren’t going to put native res in the official marketing material.  Games are optimized around upscaling now and it is unhelpful and misleading to pretend otherwise. Rendering 4x as many pixels is *obviously* going to throw things off with more intensive effects, and lead to a generally unplayable experience.",Neutral

Intel,"people also forget both AMD and nvidia didn't really offer a generation leap in GPU performance this gen, sure it's popular to call games ""unoptimized"" (I know many AAA releases are, not denying that) but the issue compounds with the fact that game devs couldn't predict a GPU generation to be this bad caused by inflated crypro-boom margins a generation prior",Negative
Intel,"As with almost every game release recently, expect the game to perform a bit better than the requirements.    Sometimes the hardware can achieve 60 FPS most of the time but drops below that in other times, so the devs just say it's guaranteed 30 FPS and call it a day. If you look at the 5700 vs 6700XT, the gap is almost 50% in most titles, this means that if the numbers for the 5700 were accurate then the 6700XT will be getting around 45 FPS at 1080p low (unless the game utilizes special hardware only available on the 6700XT) but the game targets 60 FPS at 1080p high on the 6700XT which leads me to believe the 5700 is gonna perform much better which should leave room for turning off upscaling.",Positive

Intel,"I agree with this, that’s not that outrageous if this does include RT. Non RT would be pretty bad to need fsr but that is the quality mode.",Neutral
Intel,This is going to be the exact same situation as with Alan Wake. The game is going to come out and the requirements are going to make sense. People just aren't used to seeing games with mandatory rt.,Neutral
Intel,I would say pressured bc they announced it over a year ago and promised we will get it in september. Thats the problem with games an tech they all make promises and then cant keep the deadline. Just make smth new and when it works then announce it and make the last fine adjustments. If you make promises to early you set yourself up for failure.,Negative

Intel,"> what a shame pc gaming has become  I mean, PC gaming is in the best state ever. So many amazing games that run so well. Just don't buy all these shitty games, not like there is a shortage.  Tbh this game looks like standard movie cash grab shite anyway. Solid 4/10 game I bet.",Negative
Intel,Which means if all games will require upscaling it will force AMD to improve there's. I'm on board with you though will see way less optimization going forward which is not what we want.,Negative

So there's that 😉",Negative
Intel,Timed epic exclusivity? Aww man.,Neutral
Intel,Was guaranteed to happen when up scaling was announced... It's an excuse for less optimisation or to push fidelity more.  I saw a video of this avatar game it got an insane amount of plants visible at all times.,Negative
Intel,You... are.. joking... right..?,Neutral
Intel,Because it’s not coming to steam. It’ll be an epic games exclusive so everyone will pass on it until it hits steam in 18 months. At which point no one will buy an 18 month old game for full price and will wait for a 50% off sale at the minimum.,Neutral

Intel,"Really comes up to how far the rt and lumen stuff can be pushed, if it goes to cyberpunk psycho rt levels? At release it needed a 3080 and 3090 with dlss.   So it could need top end gpu of this gen if its a similar case",Neutral
Intel,yup that is why I will play 1440 UW native with a 7900XTX.,Neutral
Intel,I guess they are confused with dlss.  Dlss 2= up scaling Dlss3 = frame gen  So they thought its for fsr3 too. ( as in fsr2 up scaling and 3 frame gen)   But fsr3 can do frame gen or not.  Fsr3 is up scaling and frame gen.,Neutral
Intel,"Likely mid range gpu and a suit yells in the background ""30 fps with up scaling is fine""",Neutral
Intel,"Likely the same, they didn't want to make the graph even more annoying, hence why fsr3 and rt and xess are mentioned top right.  They got anyway already confused with fsr3 and fsr2 ( cause 3 is fsr frame gen and up scaling it's not like dlss where 2 is up scaling and 3 is frame gen)",Negative
Intel,Very similar performance I guess,Neutral
Intel,Ye,Neutral
Intel,They've been using it since forever. The difference is that PC GPUs were 10x faster than console GPUs so there was no need for it on PC.,Neutral

Intel,For 30fps even lol,Neutral
Intel,"Especially recommending FSR.  DLSS at 1080p? Sure why not?   FSR at 1080p? Disgusting, absolutely horrific.  Anyone who downvotes this is a fanboy, end of story. Nvidia's DLSS simply is better at reconstructing an image. At lower resolutions that is SIGNIFICANTLY more important.",Negative
Intel,Or be happy your shitty video card is still supported.,Neutral
Intel,and we still get shat on for saying they are or admitting its a bad thing. corpo fanbois are so cringe,Negative
Intel,Even 4090 users use DLSS because it fixes TAA problems. And has a sharpening slider for easy sharpening adjustment.,Positive
Intel,When did I ever complain about how expensive gpus are. I've always been in the category that they are luxury item and vendor can charge whatever they want for em. So you aint never hear me complain about gpu prices.,Negative
Intel,I can't market a game for running with 120fps 4k with raytracing on on a RTX 4060.  But I can market 400 completely identical missions that take up 150 hours of your lifespan and empty out your soul.,Negative
Intel,Yea I know nothing about optimizations and if it could or couldn't fix this or that. I just want them to tell me exactly what I need to run the game at X resolution a Y preset with 60 fps. If that calls for a 14900k and a 4090 then just say so.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, I think we're really beginning to see a trend here with abusing upscaling for free mileage.  Not that upscaling isn't great but...  Apart from RT, on medium settings, I can't really see    massive improvements on visual quality that would warrant such a massive increase on requirements.  UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  We'll probably see this continuing to be a trend for a while, and then as tech novelty wears out, some devs will come out with more optimized and scalable titles.  With hardware prices being as they are, and with 60fps now being highly requested in consoles as well, it's pretty much a given.",Negative
Intel,"People accepted upscaling with open arms, so now devs know they can rely on people using it. Thus they don't have to care about optimizing for native res anymore. Oh you have a 4k card? Okay well we'll make sure it can run the game at 1080p so you can upscale it.",Neutral
Intel,"No average consumer wanted to come to this point. The market leader started pushing upscaling instead of just making stronger GPU’s and there’s nothing AMD can do to win them, only join them.",Negative
Intel,Turns out TAA is worse than AI TAA with AI upscaling.   Of course devs are gonna use it to cover their own asses. And they get perf boost!  Let's face it. The FUTURE is AI everything. Nobody is gonna talk shit about frame generation and upscaling when it looks perfect each frame.,Negative
Intel,But it does in many ways.,Neutral
Intel,"I don't know who those people are. I play all my games on native, whether I'm using an amd or nvidia card.",Neutral

Intel,"If I relabeled ""Medium"" preset to ""Ultra"" preset and changed nothing else and told you that you can run this game at Native 1440P Ultra on a midrange 7800XT card and get 60+FPS, would that be ""optimized"" now?",Negative

Now with all the quality preset, we can't figure what quality to expect. 4k60fps at balenced preset? What's that crap even supposed to mean as thoses presets vary from title to title, from NVIDIA to amd. And btw, I'm still using fxaa over taa and fsr when i can, don't ask me why.",Negative
Intel,"You're even seeing this on console, where Spiderman 2 now has RT reflections in every mode. Even Unreal 5's Lumen renderer is a software raytracer that can be hardware accelerated.  RT is the future because there are scenarios that rasterized rendering is just not capable of resolving. Screen space reflection artifacts, light leaking, weird glow on indirectly lit models... I find these so distracting and immersion breaking.",Negative
Intel,onto absolutely nothing.,Negative
Intel,"Wait what? No performance improvement this gen? Bullshit, RTX 4090 is literally 2 times faster than RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 is only 10% Faster than the 3080  you do the math. RTX 4080 is 50% Faster than RTX 3080.",Negative
Intel,Or the game performs at 50 fps at 1080p low on 5700 but 50fps is a weird number to target and they can't say 60 so they just say 30fps and call it a day.,Negative

Intel,Honestly my 1070 still runs great for what it is. It’s in my sons rig now because it couldn’t keep up with 1440p depending on the game and definitely not 4k. Still a fairly solid 1080p card.,Positive
Intel,False.  guy blocked me lmao,Negative
Intel,"I thought that was on Linux, though I might be wrong",Neutral
Intel,1070 doesn't have hardware RT though.,Neutral
Intel,According to the technical director there's no non-raytracing mode. I'm assuming that means software ray tracing for the minimum spec.  Source: Skill Up video - https://youtu.be/v91y87R5iDk?t=332 (5m32s),Neutral

Intel,Completely agree.,Neutral
Intel,Damn my brain must have been on auto pilot. I'm so used to 2160p + FSR quality neatly equalling 1440p.,Negative
Intel,I see the 5700 and the GTX 1070 on the minimum specs. Are those cards going to be RT capable for this game? (It's 30FPS LOW with FSR but still.),Neutral

Intel,Yep. This company learned something from all the failure game launches that happened this year. The game companies can't just implement one gpu company's tech and not the others bc then it'll only work on the one gpu that you implemented the tech for and it won't work on the other gpus from other companies. Meaning for example if a game company only implemented fsr it's only going to work on amd gpus and not on Nvidia and Intel gpus and vise versa is true too for both Nvidia and Intel gpus for dlss and xess.,Negative
Intel,Avatar is RT only. There is no non RT mode.,Neutral
Intel,This is mad with snowdrop engine. It's Ubisoft they don't use unreal...,Negative
Intel,"Yep, I missed that. Good call! Makes sense why the specs are a bit higher then but if it is forced on, that's going to be rough on any one with a more mid tier card.",Neutral
Intel,">  Consoles use mostly FSR balanced  heck sometimes they use performance or less, heck a lot of the time even. Especially with RT or performance modes",Neutral
Intel,They have really long way to go. Take for example Lords of the Fallen - UE5's TSR is better than FSR. Take Alan Wake 2 and you get ton of shimmering on the edges. It's also not like nvidia not improving - so while AMD makes a step forward so will do nvidia..   There's also question how much they improve without dedicated accelerators that both Intel and nvidia is using. Intel jumped late to the party and they're already ahead - which just shows how much AMD cares. It's rally embarrassing considering both XBOX and PlayStation are also relying on FSR - ant that's bigger market than what nvidia has.,Neutral
Intel,I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?  I mean the facts are the facts. I need to play on lower settings till we get a 5070 or 8800xt.,Neutral
Intel,"It uses their own in-house engine, Snowdrop. The last game this developer did was The Division II which was excellent.",Neutral

Intel,You will never see a high production game from Ubisoft ever on the Steam store ever again at initial launch.  They are the anti-christ of the gaming industry seriously.,Negative
Intel,Consoles are the baseline in most multiplat games and they've been using upscaling since forever. The real reason is just that we don't have GPUs anymore that are 10x faster than consoles like last gen. You can't bruteforce high resolutions in games that run at like 720p on consoles with GPUs that are only 2-3x faster.  If upscaling didn't exist on PC the minimum here would just be 720p at the minimum and 1080p-1440p at the max.,Negative
Intel,Next-gen doesn't mean that current gen can run it well. It means it's so far ahead that most curren-gen hardware can't run it properly + top-end hardware can only barely run it well.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly. These paid exclusive games launches only make me care less whenever they actually release.  It's not just Epic, Meta has done it with several games (Moss Book 2) and when a proper looking pcvr port comes a year later it sells bad because people forgot about it.",Negative
Intel,"Is that with significant RT? I assumed it was ""normal"" ultra settings.  Still I can play Far Cry 6 and RE4 with AMD sponsored RT at 4k native with 100fps. This game will have to look amazing to justify what... a quarter of that performance?",Positive
Intel,"You are correct. I overlooked the part where, under Ultra settings, it said that was with FSR2. Now it doesn't seem as bad. I mean, it's still not good because it's rendering somewhere between 1080p and 1440p, but at least it's not 30 fps without Frame Gen/60 fps with it like I thought.",Neutral
Intel,"It might be, AFAIK neither Nvidia nor AMD still support their implementation of it in their drivers.  But I've tried it on a few games and it is pretty cool to me, much stronger than almost any modern 3D movie (IMO why 3D has gone into hibernation), and I gather that Cameron designed the franchise around 3D.  Plus the Avatar 1 game was in 3D.  FWIW.",Positive
Intel,This is what I am thinking too.,Neutral
Intel,"You say that, but they specifically mentioned FSR3, and just DLSS, so i have a feeling DLSS3 will have to go via a mod again.",Neutral
Intel,"i have a believe that even 4C8T will survive for the decade, like the case of that 4790K. But turns out these newer UE5 games are wrecking even newish CPU like the 3600. i mean cmon it's still a 4 years CPU old which i think it's not old yet",Neutral
Intel,Let's hope so. 30fps is far from recommended for FSR 3,Neutral
Intel,Yeah I heard it works with that hoping it works with fsr3 now,Positive
Intel,"I've noticed that for some reason newer games look blurry at 1080 even without any kind of upscaling and I'm not sure why, older game look much sharper at 1080p",Negative
Intel,"Just lazy optimisation, that’s pretty much a PS5 equivalent GPU and you can be damn sure that the console version won’t be 1080P 30fps with FSR",Negative
Intel,"No it says 5700. NOT 5700XT, and yes there is a difference. Quite literally the difference between a 1070 and 1080ti. Or a 2070 and 2080.",Neutral
Intel,no no my 7 year old card needs to be able to play at high settings. so does my low end card from today. gotta be high or its just bad,Negative
Intel,Crazy expectation? A game released in 2023 should be able to run at 1080p low 30fps on a low end card like rx6500xt (lowest end modern card you can buy now).  Optimization matters.,Neutral
Intel,"Yup, these cards came out around the time of ps4 I think..that's a long time ago in the graphical quality of games we are seeing.  People should be happy to a point that those cards can even run some of these games if upscaling helps them run that's a bonus as it means they don't need to upgrade if those graphics settings are acceptable to them.",Positive
Intel,"I have a 5700 and it does better at 1080p on these games than what is normally posted. Now it does need quality fsr but its not the worst thing, anything lower than quality is. Bottom line is these are not 100% correct and never have been.  I have zero interest in this game but the specs seem fine even though I wish upscaling wasn't what was relied on for optimization.",Neutral
Intel,"well you dont know what they mean by 30 fps. It could be de 1% lows or the average, we dont know. The easy assumption is that it will be 30 fps average. but that's crazy that a game at 1080p low cant be run by a 5700. It better be a new Crysis.  edit: apparently it uses raytracing only for lighting which would explain the hows and why it crushes the framerate so bad especially on a gpu that doesnt have hardware raytracing like the 5700.",Negative
Intel,"Or in the case of games like Alan Wake 2, you will get unplayable fps if you try to running it at 4k native max settings. Even with a 4090, you will get a glorious 20fps.",Negative
Intel,Assassins creed origins and odyssey side quests/collectibles oh my god,Positive
Intel,Yeah it doesn't give us a actual gauge to understand what we need for set native parameters. I mentioned optimization out of concern that they rely too much on upscaling and it seems like it's the lazy way out of something. It's unrealistic that a usable gaming experience be in a top tier hardware setup that costs $2k+ and top tier hardware of just the last generation are just barely cutting it anymore.,Negative
Intel,I appreciate your insights and opinions. Thank you.,Positive
Intel,">UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.

Intel,that's stoopid but it's somewhat more understandable. Why a 5700 would struggle so much since it doesnt have hardware raytracing,Negative

Intel,">I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?   Not exactly. It's a custom quasi-RDNA2 design (has the improved RDNA2 compute units, but it's missing a few features such as fully-DX12-compliant mesh shaders and VRS-capable ROPs).  For most purposes, it's pretty comparable to a 6700 (non-XT), with the same number of CUs (36), and similar clockspeeds.",Neutral
Intel,"Oh, wow. I didn't know that. But it'll likely be on a similar level as UE5, right?",Positive
Intel,Next gen DOES NOT MEAN that your CURRENT GEN hardware can run it well for sure... Why don't people get that?,Negative
Intel,That reminds me to grab moss 1 and 2. I just got a quest 3.   Agreed though. I’ve been waiting for kingdom hearts 3 to come to steam for so long that I’m basically going to skip it at this point. It’s still stuck on the epic game store.,Neutral
Intel,Far cry 6 and re4 are older and or lower demanding games.  And yes any Mode here does either Hardware or Software rt from. Min to max.,Neutral
Intel,It's a 4 year old cpu yes... But how it was built (4c) was like 10 12 years now old.  6 cores are since a few years already base and more and more 8 cores are standard.,Neutral
Intel,TAA,Neutral
Intel,Temporal anti aliasing.,Neutral
Intel,"TAA is the devil. it forces a blur on every frame, and only gets worse as the resolution goes lower. its why fsr, xess, and dlss can look better than """"native"""" because it doesnt use the horrid plain taa solution so many games do. and why dlaa, and fsraa are so important and need to replace taa completely",Negative
Intel,"Ahh, welcome to r/FuckTAA",Neutral
Intel,Even 4K looks blurry with some implementations of TAA,Negative
Intel,they're giving you the bare minimum until your upgrade!,Neutral
Intel,Because they are built with upscaling in mind so they have a blurry looks intentionally as it works best with aggressive upscaling.,Neutral
Intel,"Not even close, you're completely out of your mind. The 5700xt is 9% faster than the 5700. The 1080ti is **32%** faster than a 1070 and the 2080 is **19%** faster than the 2070.

Intel,"Well the difference is only 256 shaders more on the 5700xt. The 5700xt has 2560 shaders and the 5700 2304. That's 11% more. That's not that much.  The 1080ti has 86% more cuda cores than the 1070, as well as more and faster memory. I would not compare now so haha",Neutral
Intel,"The 5700 and 5700xt is more like a 1070 and 1070ti situation. It's not that big a gap, and you can close it even tighter because the majority of RX 5700 cards can be flashed to a 5700xt bios tightening the gap farther.",Neutral
Intel,"The 1070 was released in 2016. Its already the end of 2023. That card belong to ps4 era. Wake up.   People in this sub are delusional, really.",Negative
Intel,Those are some dumbass expectations. Maybe you should correct them instead of blaming the developers for it.,Neutral
Intel,"The 6500XT offers $200 2016 performance. In fact its often worse because of how gimped it is interface wise. Its one of the worst products released in recent years.  Its not the game developers fault AMD pretty much rebadged the RX 480 4 times and they can't be expected to sink their optimization to that level.  RX 480, RX580, RX 5500XT and RX6500XT are virtualy the same product performance wise. RX 5500XT is the most consistent one of the lot offering a somewhat more modern arhitecture in its 8GB variant. The 6500XT on the other hand while on a newer arhitecture is an unmitigated disaster that is on par at best and sinks even below the RX580 when memory, bus and PCIE interface constrained.  The console baseline is around 6700XT/2070 Super/3060ti level. People better get used to that as its gonna become or already has become the norm for 1080p high settings gaming. The 5700 is upwards of 30% slower by default while also having less hardware features. Its gonna become the minimum norm going forward alongside the 2060's of your time.",Negative
Intel,"the 1070 was 2016, the 5700 was 2019. While both not new its not 10 years old like the PS4 (2013)",Neutral
Intel,This is literally only true if you use path tracing. I think you're trying to insinuate the game is unoptimized when it just scales really high with visual features if your hardware supports it. It straight up runs great for the visual features it uses.,Neutral
Intel,"That was exclusive to console releases, no? And never to the point of replacing AA sharpening and rendering the game from 720p…",Neutral
Intel,No I havent. AMD is bigger than Epic.,Neutral
Intel,"Right, you'll have different complaints but complaints none the less even though the new Ultra might still look slightly better prior gen games and offer high FPS but people would complain that the graphics are not advancing fast enough, they look the same etc etc.  Yah those days are likely gone but it's hard to say if it's because the game is unoptimized or if the dev is really pushing the limits of what they can do graphically and use upscaling as a buffer because what they have in mind, or what they intend to show is too taxing for current hardware. We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it. This is why I've never in my life ever pre-ordered a game. I still don't understand why people do it (esp now that games are digital) but lot of people do. Then again I've never really paid for a ""skin"" or some other visual add-on so maybe that's what attracts people.  I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets. The presets are all relative anyways. There's no universal settings that define what each preset represents.  I just don't get the outrage on these minimum spec sheets compared to what the game is showing graphically. At least wait until it releases and we have some hard data.",Negative
Intel,"I'm also a dev dood sometimes it's literally a ""foutage de geugle"" I had a friend who talk about how shit devs in EA (the people who's making the engine) code and doesn't optimise",Negative
Intel,"The commenter I replied to said there wasn't a big generational improvement for GPUs, while I said there was. But I agree that 4080 is expensive for what it offers.",Neutral
Intel,It was the same price as a 3090 at launch and offers 90% more performance.  It was definitely a generational leap.,Positive
Intel,It's software ray tracing which isn't accelerated by hardware.,Neutral
Intel,and i guess it can be hard to tell if ram is dual or single rank with just two sticks of it too.,Neutral
Intel,>might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.  I was pointing out that 1070 doesn't have hardware RT either.,Negative
Intel,So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?,Negative
Intel,"Why not make it toggleable though, you can choose other graphics settings so it makes no sense. Most people don't play games with RT enabled",Negative
Intel,Still kinda weird that they put the RX 5700/A750 on the same ballpark as the 1070... Being that the newer GPUs actually perform closer to a 1080(Ti).,Neutral
Intel,Sounds like improperly configured negative LOD bias. If you have Nvidia you can fix it with nvinspector. On AMD there's nothing you can do IIRC if Devs mess it up.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly what I'm telling them all the time, that I can see difference in textures, in hair, fences, powerlines etc. And every time I get downvoted by the army of ""but it looks better then native"". I feel like majority of that sub needs to go get a prescription for new glasses",Negative
Intel,"So if you stopped measuring who's bigger, why do you think I have no access to DLSS? Tested on rig with 4080 on a C2 42"" screen. Once you stop thinking with the tip of your head where probably Nvidia's logo is tattooed or maybe Jensen's face, who knows, you could come to realization that one person have access to more hardware then only his personal rig.  Do I say that FSR is better then DLSS? No! Both of them have their issues, but none of them is better then native. Keep on fanboying mate, instead of providing normal convoy as grownups",Neutral
Intel,I don't think YOU understand what you're talking about.  Did you seriously expect Snowdrop to be something used in like one game and then discarded completely?,Negative
Intel,"The thing is: creating good looking lightning with RT is much easier than with prebaked illumination. I can fully understand, why developers of new games are using RT as the basis of their game.",Positive
Intel,Minimum requirements go up as games get/look better. They probably made this game with the series s as the minimum. Low settings probably looks better than high in most games.   Rt for the last few years has been added on top of already complete games. Now games are being made with rt as the standard and they would have to manually do a ton of extra work to support 7+ year old hardware. It's the same as having to drop support for last gen consoles to be able to deliver a better game.,Neutral
Intel,"And still - superior upscaling makes it worth paying extra, RT on higher end is worth paying extra. AMD even this gen doesn't undercut price by enough, especially in EU where power efficiency also play a role. For example, assuming I'm gonna use GPU for 2 gens, then I save ~90-100€ with my usage just on electricity alone. I know it's over period of 4 years, but still it's price difference that will recoup over time, even if I have to pay extra upfront. AMD is simply no longer a value proposition.",Neutral
Intel,"They did not, lol - that fixes completely different thing, not the FSR caused shimmering edges.",Negative
Intel,Both excellent 👌 Down the Rabbit Hole was another solid one.,Positive
Intel,"RE4 came out this year.  Anyway the difference between us is I don't think any lighting effect is worth a $1,000 GPU using 1080p resolution and 60fps, but I know many disagree. That's life.",Neutral
Intel,"3600 and the 3300x was built with the TSMC 7nm if i recall, that was 2018 cutting edge tech. and somehow in gaming it's already obsolete. i was planning to replace mine with 5700x  but i cancel it because it's still very much capable for what i do now. but now after UE5 i think i'll reconsider it again, maybe even as far as 5800X3D",Neutral
Intel,It is crazy that I see everyone saying that modern games look blurry. I've known for years taa does this but it seems like I see more people than ever dissatisfied by it.,Negative
Intel,I have to turn it off in borderlands 3. Ugh.,Neutral
Intel,r/FuckTAA,Neutral
Intel,"My friend nicknamed it after his eyesight. When he wears glasses he has 20/20, but when he doesn’t he says that he sees the image about the same as without glasses",Neutral
Intel,"Out of curiosity what resolution do you usually game at and at what distance? I find taa usually looks pretty good in modern games, but I'm also playing on a TV (48 inches but I'm not at monitor distance anymore). When I played on my 1920x1200 monitor I HATED TAA, well, not as much as fxaa, but moreso than smaa, and I missed msaa or SGSSAA with a passion. Now on the TV at 4k (lol, usually not on a 6700xt), 1440p, or even 1080p I find TAA can do a pretty decent job paired with varying levels of the Radeon sharpness adjustment in the adrenaline drivers. But again, probably due to viewing distance.  Looks leagues better than FXAA and I prefer it to SMAA now. But again, I'm sitting further away and tweaking sharpening to my liking. FSR2 seems to be a wash most of the time but the performance gain is worth it.",Positive
Intel,You dumbass do understand that even the console version of the recent games are total mess? Alan wake 2 have to run on reduced settings to even reach 30fps on xbox/PS. Callisto protocol used to have frametime issue on consoles. Console ports still targets 30fps on quality settings with upscaling while target should be 60fps with 120fps for performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, seems you are correct, it was the ps4 pro that came out in 2016, still, I wouldn't expect that to be capable of running some of the games we are seeing now without some serious compromises.",Neutral
Intel,I never said that Alan Wake 2 is unoptimised. I just said that even a 4090 can’t max out the game at native 4K resolution.,Negative
Intel,epic is tencent...,Neutral
Intel,"In terms of absolute numbers sure, 3090 always had a stupid price tho for being 10% faster than a 3080.   In terms of performance per dollar the 4090 even at 2x 3080 performance was worse value since you pay 1600 not 1400.",Negative
Intel,"Yes, you either have to get the spec sheet of the RAM modules (That even then it may not specify if it's a single/dual rank module) or test it in a system and use HWinfo/CPU-Z. Not as straightforward as dual channel that's mostly just using two identical modules.",Neutral
Intel,You don't need RT hardware to do software RT. That's what I'm saying.,Neutral
Intel,"For this particular game, there is a software fallback. Also, even if we did get a game that mandated hardware support for RT they'd still likely build it with console in mind so even RDNA2 GPUs shouldn't have issues",Neutral
Intel,"The first RT/DLSS capable cards are 5 years old now, way older than the current consoles. You are definitely not being left behind if you're only outdated by 1 gen lol",Neutral
Intel,I mean the last non ray tracing cards were released 4 years ago (1650/60 and 5000s from AMD),Neutral
Intel,Games running poorly on computers weaker than current gen consoles isn't exactly anything new.,Negative
Intel,"No, you have multiple generations of games from prior to raytracing to enjoy.  Games shouldn't be held back forever just because someone wants to game on a GeForce2 MX400.",Neutral
Intel,You are stuck playing older games. Unless someone can find a way to disable it with a mod.,Neutral
Intel,> So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?  A gen old is second gen RT e.g. rtx 3000.  We're halfway through the third RT/matrix generation right now.,Negative
Intel,Yes hah,Neutral
Intel,"The 3090 or 6950xt will very likely run this game extremely well, they're a gen old.",Positive
Intel,"For the AMD GPU, it's probably because minimum will be the max it will support. Medium probably requires Hardware RT.  For Intel, I don’t know. Perhaps it signal not so great optimization for Intel GPUs...",Neutral
Intel,DLSS is very strong in thin lines like fences & hair. Much better than most TAA solutions. Not sure about FSR in general.  An example: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6erA6BVkAAuf_M?format=jpg&name=large  Only DLSS resolves the lines properly.,Neutral
Intel,"I mean, it's not that black and white. Quality upscaling to 1080 will obviously be more noticeable than 4k. Maybe you *can* tell the difference between 4k native and dlss quality, but people aren't gonna believe you unless you prove it with some kind of blind test, but I doubt you'd be willing to go out of your way to do that.  Even if you could, the benefits of better aa might outweight some negligible drop in textures or whatever it is upscaling reduces. Though that's irrelevant when DLAA or NAA are options too, I guess.",Neutral
Intel,"Test, which one looks better, explain.  https://imgsli.com/MjE3MzEy",Neutral
Intel,Oh man the hair... its so crazy how much upscaling kills the hair..,Negative
Intel,i mean they already arent the smartest bulbs considering they went team green.,Neutral
Intel,Reading comrehension dude.,Neutral

Intel,That will depend on the user. Power is cheap here in canada so none of thar factors into my buying decisions. And rt will depends on the games you play also not everyone plays tripple a games.,Neutral
Intel,"You need to get 23.20.17.05.  Fixed Issues Intermittent flicker may be observed on some textures while playing Alan Wake 2.  Fixed for most people, also has a nice performance boost of about 10fps from what I'm seeing.  That being said I always prefer native resolution unless absolutely necessary. So far only had to use it in Martha is Dead.",Positive
Intel,Nice. It’s on the list. Thanks man,Positive
Intel,Yes.... 7nm was but 4 cores the actual important thing was obsolete like 10 or 12 years ago.,Neutral
Intel,Probably because TAA is (unfortunately) more prevalent than it ever was.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, most people are FINE with it. Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  The thing is, you have sharpening filters today. You can adjust the sharpening for TAA. You can make it look oversharpened if you want. There's driver level sharpening for both AMD and NVIDIA. Both also have software sharpening filters.  And DLSS and FSR bot have sharpening sliders.  There's 3 ways to adjust how blurry and how sharp the game looks for everyone. It's a non issue and even Digital Foundry acknowledges the benefits of TAA for game devs vs things like the blur. At the end of the day, these games are looking great...in this era, with exceptions. Not all games are blur. The whole blur thing was like in the past 4 years since upscalers started and TAA became the norm. But with all the sharpening options, and with devs actually used to making TAA not so soft looking, things are definitely getting a lot better for TAA.",Neutral
Intel,Oh my bad if I read that wrong,Negative
Intel,And I'm saying 1070 doesn't have hardware RT so it's just as gimped as AMD cards when doing RT.,Negative
Intel,Still pretty annoying nonetheless. Until it's stable no way should it be forced upon a game when someone's willing to run it normally at native.,Negative
Intel,"and the 2080ti is still winning, best purchase in gpu i made in a long time.",Positive
Intel,imagine being mad that 4 year old cards arent high end,Negative
Intel,I'm on a 6700XT. 🙇. I just feel very shocked that I would probably need a gpu upgrade soon. With the demands of new games. Also 1440p ruined me.,Negative
Intel,"Technically makes sense, but they can just make RT something you can toggle between Software/Hardware and they also could just add the Vega 56 in the requirement sheet being that was AMD's competitor to the 1070 or they could've added the GTX 1080(Ti)/RTX 2060(Super) into the sheet.  On Intel's side they only have the A580 as the closest GPU to a 1070, even when it's too similar to the A750 performance wise :/",Neutral
Intel,"It is that black and white for me. I can immediately see the added image softness from upscaling, and it's especially prevalent with DLSS 2.5+ unless you enable a sharpening filter. DLAA also has weird issues like blurring textures (almost like it reverts to initial mipmap) while moving, usually at mid-distance from camera. It's too distracting and I have to go back to regular TAA. Immediately goes away.  1440p to 2160p is better than 720p to 1080p, but it's still noticeable. Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible? No. Actually changing monitor resolution outside of native and having all UI elements scaled looks terrible. That was what we used to do and upscaling is much better than that alternative. LCD panels need to stay at native signal resolution and GPU should scale render resolutions.",Negative
Intel,"And you look at static image all the time while gaming? It's different story when movement is involved, that's where you find all the artefacts you get. Static image doesn't tell a thing when it comes to gaming",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, and that's driving me crazy. I really couldn't stand it in Cyberpunk (in other titles it's either hit or miss), that I play it in native 4k instead.",Negative
Intel,"Wouldn't phrase it like that tough. I had that choice too in January, and actually by going 4070Ti instead of 7900XT I would be able to play Cyberpunk in higher fidelity and better frames then on mine, because AMD cooked FSR3.0 almost a year in the oven, and God knows how long it will take for CDPR to add it to the game, if ever considering that active development on game is ended and they are on bug fixing sprint right now. Also AMD needs to fix FSR in general, because how it works with smaller details like hair and fences is awful. But don't get me wrong, I love my card, just feel I git sold on features that would come handy right kow instead of when I don't need them anymore",Neutral
Intel,"Sorry mate, guess I need to read comments early morning instead of late night, just saw that last bit. My apologies. I'm just tired of upscalare wars whatever sub I go, and green team fanboys screaming that ""FSR is shit, DLSS is better then native"" and then throwing around static images for comparison",Negative
Intel,"It's for textures, not object edges from FSR use, lol. Two completely different things",Neutral
Intel,"people echoing the same shit like ""ooh 4C is obsolete, you need to upgrade that geriatric cpu"". 4C is still solid for gaming (ofc no UE5) and literally anything beside doing compute intensive professional workloads.",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening makes the image less blurry, but it doesn't recover the texture detail lost from TAA blur.",Negative
Intel,"""Even Nvidia foundry""   \---   they are like chief proponents of blur-tech and they don't care about how sharp and easy-to-see the image is. TAA flattens the image so you can't see which objects are far and which are near, you have to strain your eyes and mind to determine that which is unbearable to many. Just give us option to disable it even if it breaks some effects (which is just lazy thing to do on the side of devs)",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening fixes blur, not clearity. That is TAA destroys+add significant ghosting no matter the implementation.      Sharpening looks was worse than the normal cleairy of games, it's not the same thing at all.      >Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  We are mad because it being forced 1 and 2 it's being used to hide lazy effects that break without temporal frame smearing. People are now punished for turning off forced frame smearing.",Negative
Intel,And I'm saying that maybe the GTX 1070 is better at even software RT compared to AMD cards with no RT hardware. GTX 10 series card did get RTX support through CUDA even though they were horribly bad at it. Older AMD cards with no RT hardware didn't get any support like that from AMD.,Neutral
Intel,"You're not forced to use upscaling though. Unless you replied to the wrong person this is about ray tracing, which can be run at native just fine. If your GPU can't handle RT at native res, then just use upscaling.",Neutral
Intel,The minimum requirements for this game includes de 1070: a 7-year-old gpu from 2016.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm not really shocked, and was out there telling people not to buy those cards on day 1 in large part because of their deficiencies in RT performance and complete lack of matrix accelerators (which Nvidia and Intel have both made a large part of their architecture and got shockingly good results with - DLSS and matrix-XeSS are twice as good as FSR)",Negative
Intel,5700 was probably the lowest AMD card they had to test with.,Neutral
Intel,"It also looks better in gameplay, less ghosting, less shimmering, less aliasing.   So which one looks better? You clearly see the difference in textures/fences/powerline, right?  I even made it easier for you, both images are 1080p output.",Positive
Intel,I personally didn't try DLSS even once but FSR 2.0 does have shimmering I notice to various degrees. It was very noticable on fur in Ratchet & Clank cutscenes for example. Overall I am just happy my 5700xt could still keep up with 1440p.,Neutral
Intel,Hmm yeah whatever you want to believe and let's you sleep.  Have a nice day.,Positive
Intel,AMD CAS is aimed to restore detail,Neutral
Intel,"They aren’t chief proponents of anything, TAAU has been popular for well over a decade at this point and it’s the default approach for consoles (checkerboarding has moire and aliasing issues) and digital foundry simply recognizes this is the reality of how the console world has settled on doing graphics.",Neutral
Intel,The problem with Nvidia is they are massively overpriced. One 4080 would probably cost the same as my whole build or more.,Negative
Intel,"Yes I see which one looks better, and as I said before it's a static image. While I didn't use upscaling in this same exact example, I can go by my own experience and tell that it doesn't look better then native let's say in same Cyberpunk or any other game. And I will beleive my own eyes on my own screen then static images tossed around. TBH, in my opinion it all depends on screen and screen size too, as to me that difference between upscaled and native was less noticible on my old 27"" 1440p screen then it is now on 42"" 4k. DLAA tough, that's another story",Neutral
Intel,"I tried both, and neither of them are better then native as people tend to claim. In my testing FSR have big problem with smaller details like hair, fur, fences, powerlines and as you mentioned, you get severe shimmering effect. I really hope AMD will keep on working on it, an try to get away from that. But DLSS also adds shimmer, it's just less visible then in FSR (atleast in my testing on Cyberpunk pre 2.0), and whatever upscaling method I've used I also could see that image is upscaled (lower res textures here and there etc.). I like idea being upscaling tech, it helps prolong life of GPUs, and for more powerful GPUs to run higher settings with more fidelity, but there's still work to do on them as they aren't perfect yet.",Negative
Intel,Yeah but a 3060ti didn't,Neutral
Intel,"In Cyberpunk you are not comparing upscaling vs no upscaling at the same settings though. You are comparing low RT native vs path traced upscaling and at 4K, the decission there is absolutely clear. On my 4k OLED screen, upscaled PT is so clearly the way to go, there is no competition.",Neutral
Intel,"The gameplay looks exactly like the image + your typical TAA/DLSS smearing. And as I said, in my example DLSS also looks better in gameplay, because as you see... native has a ton of aliasing which is super noticeable while playing (shimmering). There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling. Talking about native is nonesense, just image quality counts and thats were DLSS or even FSR 2 (some games) gets better and better. There is a reason why consoles use it... it looks better than without it.",Positive

Intel,"I mean, Path tracing is to Ray tracing, what Ray tracing is too rasterization.",Neutral
Intel,When Cyberpunk first came out the 3090 only got 20 fps in RT Psycho mode.  https://tpucdn.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-founders-edition/images/cyberpunk-2077-rt-3840-2160.png  Still does  Fast forward just one gem and you don't see anyone saying its demanding with many able to get RT Psycho on thier cards as new cards got faster.  Give it 2 gens and you are going to get 4k60 here.  Gpu will improve and get faster.,Neutral
Intel,"Look at that, my 6700XT is just 19fps slower than the RTX 4090 in this title.",Negative
Intel,It's a good thing nobody has to actually play it native.,Positive
Intel,Well good thing literally nobody is doing that…,Negative
Intel,The future is not in native resolution so this is really pointless information.  Cyberpunk looks absolutelt mindblowlingy insane with all the extra graphical bells and whistles it has gotten over the years and with Nvidia’s technology it runs so damn smooth as well.,Positive
Intel,4.3fps lol. No amount of upscaling is going to fix that and make it playable. People were saying the 7900xtx had 3090ti levels of RT when it launched. A 4060 ti is 50% faster then it.,Negative
Intel,That's actually pretty amazing for any GPU to get a metric in frames per second instead of minuites per frame.,Positive
Intel,"Meh I get like 90+ fps with everything cranked with RR, FG and DLSS(Balanced) toggled on with my 4090 @ 4k.  Path tracing does introduce ghosting which is annoying buts not really noticeable most times but at the same time with RR enabled it removes shimmering on 99% of objects that is normally introduced with DLSS so I am willing to compromise.   Honestly as someone who used to have a 7900XTX I am disappointed with AMD its clear that AI tech in gaming is the way forward and they just seem so far behind Nvidia now and even Intel(going by some preview stuff). FSR is just not even comparable anymore.",Negative
Intel,Who cares when it looks worse than with dlss and ray reconstruction on top of running a lot worse? Native res 4k is pointless.,Negative
Intel,"Well the upscaling in this game is really good, DLSS with ray reconstructions AI accelerated denoiser provides better RT effects than the game at native with its native Denoiser.  Also Path tracing scales perfectly with resolution so upscaling provides massive gains. using DLSS quality doubles performance to 40fps, and dlss balanced gives 60fps on average, performance about 70-80 or 4x native 4K, that includes the 10-15% performance gain RR gives as well over the native denoiser as well.  I've been playing with about 60fps on average 50-70. with DLSS Balanced and RR and its been amazing. I don't like frame gen tho since it causes VRR flickers on my screen",Positive
Intel,"Running Ray Tracing or Path Tracing without DLSS or Ray Reconstruction is like intentionally going into a battlefield without any gear whatsoever, it's absolutely pointless and suicidal, what we can clearly see here though is top of the line 7900 XTX losing against already mediocre mid-range 4060 Ti by over 50%, which is just beyond embarrassing for AMD Radeon.  All this says to me is AMD Radeon need to get their shit together and improve their RT / PT performance, otherwise they will continue to lose more Marketshare on GPU department no matter how hard their fanboys thinks that they are pointless features, just like DLSS was back on 2020 right?  Also, with my 4070 Ti OC i can run it at average of over 60 FPS at 1440p DF optimized settings with DLSS Balanced + Ray Reconstruction without even using DLSS Frame Gen, with it on i can get over 80+ FPS",Negative

I've tried many times with different ray-tracing options and they all look good and all. But in the end I closed them all, turned back to Ultra Quality without ray-tracing and started playing the game over 120FPS.  This is a good action fps game now. I need high fps with as low latency as possible. So who cares about ray-tracing and path-tracing.  Yeah ray-tracing and path-tracing are good. But we are at least 2-3 generations away for them to become mainstream. When they are easily enabled on mid-range gpus with high-refresh rate monitors, they will be good and usable then :)",Positive

Intel,"""Get Nvidia if you want a good ray tracing experience""  Yes Nvidia GPUs give a better ray tracing experience but is it really worth it if you are required to turn on DLSS? Imo, the more AI-upscaling you have to turn on, the worse the Nvidia purchase is.   I have a 6900XT and I will readily admit that the RT experience (ultra RT, no path tracing) at native 1080p resolution is ok, like 30-45 FPS (around 50 on medium RT settings), but if I turn RT lighting off (so RT shadows, sunlight, and reflections are still present) suddenly I get pretty consistent 60 FPS (i left my frames tied to monitor refresh rate, so 60 FPS is my max) and i can't tell the damn difference at native 1080p compared to RT medium or Ultra.

Intel,"Once they introduced this dlss upscaling anti-lag all these gimmicks I don't think we've seen true 4K native and almost anything lately.  This is maybe one game that does look that good but many of the games don't look that great and have some really serious system requirements when there are games that look much better and are much better optimized.  Companies are taking shortcuts, instead of optimizing they give you suboptimal and use FSR dlss all these gimmicks.  Don't get me wrong I always thought it was great for people who wanted to reach a certain frames per second someone with a weaker system to allow them to play at least the minimal at a steady frame rate.  It just seems like this is the normal now non-optimized games.  The 4090 is a beast if you could only get about 20 frames native with Ray tracing it tells you everything you need to know about Ray tracing.  It needs to be reworked that needs to be a new system I believe one real engine has it built in in a certain way probably not as good as Ray tracing directly.  To me it seems like ray tracing is hampering many games that tried to add it, too much focus on that instead of actual making a good game.

But the FG in CP2077 is decent with 60 fps output, ~~and I get ~65-70 fps output with quality DLSS + FG at 4k on a 4090.~~ EDIT: I misremembered what I was getting. With path tracing, DLSS quality, frame generation, and ray reconstruction, I got 80.1 fps with the benchmark!  Of course there's the matter of latency, and the latency of CP2077 with FG output of ~65-70 fps isn't great. So I'll often use DLSS balanced + FG.

It's not about being a fanboy of amd, but ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick, not because it's unnoticeable or bad, just because it's not ""popular"" (I myself really like it). I would personally go amd over nvidia because those 50 or so euros more that nvidia has against the amd counter parts simply are too much for just better rt and  dlss. I could spend those for a better amd card with generally better performance.  Regarding dlss, personally I would just lower the graphics before resorting to kinda bad generated frames, fsr even worse. But that's my point of view.  I find that amd still has to fix some driver issues but other than that, they are a fine brand. (so is nvidia)",Neutral

Intel,I would still argue it's still in proof of concept stage. The tech will only become viable once the flagship GPU'S start getting 4k 60fps at native. That will the allow the lower end GPU'S to get 4k 60 or 1440p 60 upscaled.,Neutral
Intel,I mean I have no problem playing at 30fps dlss balance at 1080p DF optimized settings on a 2080ti with pathtracing idc what anyone says RT/PT is the future it just looks so much better than Rasterization,Positive
Intel,"Possibly a little more. Assuming that the leaked 1.7x improvement is right and path tracing performance scales the same, that would be about 34 fps at 4k native. Might be possible to hit 60fps or close to it with DLSS Quality.",Neutral
Intel,It could as well do 60fps if Nvidia adds a lot of path tracing HW into the GPU.,Neutral
Intel,Fanboyism of both kinds is bad,Negative
Intel,"It won't end, but hopefully we see games that have art designed with RT lighting and reflections in mind.  Cyberpunk isn't it. We'd need a full rebuild of the game, every location, every asset and surface remade, so it looks like originally intended by the artists.",Neutral
Intel,Since it needs more than 10gb vram,Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is more optimized than majority of games that came out in last two years. Just because you can't run it at 4k 120 fps with path tracing doesn't mean it's not optimized.,Positive
Intel,It’s not unoptimized at all. Game runs great for the quality of the graphics. You guys just don’t understand the insane amount of power path tracing takes. The fact you can do it at all rn is insane but once again people just throw “unoptimized” at it because they don’t understand the technical marvel happening in front of their eyes.,Negative
Intel,"No, this game is actually very well optimized. It's just extremely demanding at 4k native, which is why DLSS exists.  It would be unoptimized if it ran like this while looking like nothing special, but this is probably the game with the best graphics, period. At the very least, it's certainly the game with the best lighting.",Positive
Intel,"and people will be like ""well RT is the future""  raster was fine for over 15 years and raster games look great but we get it we must let incompetent game devs and their bosses make shit quality games because average gamer is ready to spend $100 to pre-order electronic version of horse shit and then justify it for years because they can't admit they wasted money",Negative
Intel,It's settled that you have no idea what you talking about,Neutral
Intel,Its full path tracing u cannot really optimize this much.,Negative
Intel,"It always did. Most games don't scale well, Cyberpunk does.  Look at the last two years of pc ports and you will understand how cyberpunk looks and performs like it's black magic.",Neutral
Intel,"Baked illumination requires you to choose where to add light sources and how the lighting is applied to everything, it's a creative choice of the author, the AI needs instructions to know what to do, so it would need constant handholding, on the other hand RT uses simple physics to calculate how light bounced and NN to apply the light on surfaces.",Neutral
Intel,But the destructable environment and the water graphics and other things in Direct X 9 made high end pcs kneel as well.  I remember playing on my 9800gtx/+ with my Intel Q9300 quad core (lapped and oc'ed to 3.0ghz - EDIT: checked some old evga posts got it to 3.33ghz) with 2x4gigs DDR2 @1000mhz cas 5 trying to maintain a sustained 30fps at 900p resolution on my 1680x1050 monitor. And I oc'ed the crap out of that 9800gtx 835 mhz (cant recall if it was unlinked shadder or not now) core on blower air (won the silicon lottery with that evga card).  Tweaking settings was mostly user done and guided with old school limited forum help. Ahh the good old days of having lots of time during school breaks.,Neutral
Intel,"The equivalent of a 4090 at the time, 8800 ultra (768MB) got 7.5 fps at 1920x1200 very high quality. The other cards were not able to run it. Even the lowest tier last generation card runs this, even though it's at 5% speed.",Neutral
Intel,No and no again lol  The 8800gtx could do 1152x864 high and that was the top dog. DX9 cards could do that at medium but high shaders was like a 25fps average tops and that dropped into the teens on the snow level.   It took things like the gtx480 and HD 6970 to do 1920x1080 30fps max settings. That's before getting into Sandy Bridge being the first cpu that could sustain 40+ fps if the gpu power was there.   Crysis came during the core 2 duo/k8 athlon and first wave dx10 cards era and it took *2 more generations* of *both* gpus and cpus to do it some justice.,Neutral
Intel,"My 8800ultra was getting single digit fps at 1080p ultra, so CP isn't quite as demanding.",Negative
Intel,Amd had a tessellation unit. It went unused but it was present,Neutral
Intel,"My fun story for PhysX was Mirrors Edge. I don't remember what GPU I had at the time but the game was pretty new when I played it. Ran fine for quite some time until one scene where you get ambushed in a building by the cops and they shoot at the glass. The shattering glass with PhysX turned on absolutely TANKED my framerates, like single digit. I didn't realize that the PhysX toggle was turned on in the settings. This was at a time when PhysX required a dedicated PCIe card in your system.   Once I turned it off it ran fine. Now I can run that game at ridiculous framerates without my system getting warm.",Positive
Intel,"I remember around about 2008 when companies like Asus and Dell were selling ""Physics Processing Units"" and some claimed that these would be commonplace in gaming machines just like Graphics cards had become 10 years previously.",Neutral

Intel,>PhysX  It never was a dedicated Nvidia card - it was a [dedicated psysx](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/bfg-ageia-physx-card/) on which the tech later was bought by Nvidia and implemented in it's own GPU's.  But the things never became really populair.,Neutral
Intel,"This makes me wonder if we'll ever see something similar with Raytracing, where we get a 2nd GPU purely for RT, and then the main GPU just does all the other stuff. Would that even be possible?",Neutral

Intel,The ray/path tracing in this case done by specialized hardware which has more room to grow faster.,Neutral
Intel,"I would, transistor shrinking isn't the only method of increasing performance, and honestly, these companies have to keep putting out better cards to make money.  There have been many breakthroughs over the last few years. I give it another 5 as both amd and nvidia are pushing ai accelerated ray tracing on their cards, nvidia is in the lead for now but amd will eventually catch up.",Positive
Intel,There is still a big leap possible since all lithography processes at the moment are hybrid euv and duv.   But the moment everything is done euv things will drastically slow down.,Neutral
Intel,"No those are just pennies in the pocket of Nvidia, but as the consequence you as the customer need to take a mortgage on a brand new GPU.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah the next 10 years are gonna be spent getting budget cards up to 4090 level performance, rather than bringing the bleeding edge to 5-10x the 4090 performance. As long as 4K is king, there’s not much incentive to do the latter.",Negative
Intel,"In 10 years we will be begging one of several thousand test-tube created Musk Family members for $200 so we can buy a cheeseburger.  But the jokes on them, we’re just gonna spend it on space crack.",Negative

Intel,"They just need to render the minimum information needed , and let the ai do the rest",Neutral
Intel,"Don't get upscaling, to me it looks shite. Why spend hundreds or thousands on a GPU to not even run at native resolution.   It's something Nvidia are pushing because they've got a better version of it at the moment.  Maybe it'll improve, it's pretty much snake oil currently imo.",Negative
Intel,"Feels pretty good with 120 frames. Playing with a controller, i don‘t mind or even feel the input lag on a projector screen.",Positive
Intel,"It's mad that even with a 4090 running games at 4k, they still look less realistic than the low-res FMV sequences in The 7th Guest from 30 years ago.",Negative
Intel,"Do keep in mind that despite both being named the same, the devil's in the details. Movies use way more rays per scene and way more bounces too.   Path tracing in CP2077 shows temporal artifacts due to denoising, something that doesn't happen in movies. It is being improved with the likes of DLSS 3.5, but it is still quite off when compared to said movies.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind the systems that rendered toy story 1, costing upwards of like 300k IIRC, have less power than your cell phone today and were super delicate/finicky machines. There's a dude on youtube that got a hold of like the second best one that was made at the time and the machine honestly was really impressive for when it came out, but it pales in comparison to even a steam deck really.",Neutral
Intel,"> Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story  Toy Story didn't use path tracing though, A Bug's Life was Pixar's first movie to use ray tracing (not path tracing) and only for a few frames in the entire movie for specific reflections, they started using ray tracing more generally for Cars and I can't find exactly when they started using path tracing but it should be around the early 2010s which is also when the other Disney animation studios started using path tracing",Neutral
Intel,No it's not a miracle. Because it's downscaled a lot and also uses lower quality math and piggybacking on AI to make up for it. It's basically running through 3 layers of cheats to produce results that aren't that much better than just traditional raster.,Negative

Intel,4090 getting 60fps at 4k balanced dlss with no frame gen. 100 with frame gen. I can make it drop into the 20s if I stand right next to a fire with all the smoke and lightening effects or if I go to a heavily vegetated area it’ll drop to mid 40s. But it’s stay consistently at 55-65 and even goes Into the 90s if I head out of the city.   Haven’t tried it at quality or with dlss off though. May go do that now that it says only 19fps lol. Have to try it to see for myself,Neutral
Intel,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-dlss-35-tested-ai-powered-graphics-leaves-competitors-behind  Well it's so close (54fps) it's more like a 3080Ti or higher from 3000 series or a 4070TI + from 4000 series it seems? The old 3000 series is punching way above it weight vs the 7900xtx, which was meant to deliver similar RT performance to the 3090.. which it doesn't.",Neutral
Intel,At some point the RT pixels are so expensive that native resolution w/o DLSS and frame gen is just not gonna work for the time being.,Negative
Intel,"On the other hand, if you set the new DLSS 3.5 to performance (which you should in 4k), and just enable frame generation, you get 90+ in 4k with basically zero issues unless you pause to check frames.",Positive

Intel,I almost see no difference.   And to see the little diffidence I need to take two screenshots and compare them.,Neutral
Intel,The game look is ruined on PT it makes everything look completely different.  Regular RT keeps the style of the game and performs good.,Negative
Intel,Dont use useless raytracing and you wont have any problems lol,Negative

Intel,DLSS unironically looks better than native TAA even at 1080p in this game because of the shit ghosting.,Negative
Intel,Only people who don't give a shit about high quality graphics don't care about ray tracing.,Negative
Intel,I got a stupidly good deal on the 4090(buddy won an extra one from a company raffle) and it just so happened my XTX was one of the cards suffering from the mounting issue on release.  Honestly very happy that all of that happened. Sure I would have been happy with the 7900xtx if I got a replacement but the 4090 just kinda blew me away especially with all the DLSS tech behind it.,Positive
Intel,"Nvidia used cp77 as a testing grounds for their dlss3 and rt tech, it'd no surprise it looks and performs relatively good, they literally partnered with cdpr for that.  Do not expect these levels of RT on most games anytime soon, probably in a couple years (with rtx 5000 series) the tech will be more mature and not as taxing for most cards, because needing to upscale and use framegen to get 60fps on an RT PT setting is kinda absurd.",Positive
Intel,">only then they become great features  Watch this happen with ""fake frames"" FSR3 in real time",Negative
Intel,>Ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick   This line was already false years ago when control launched. Now it’s just absurd,Negative
Intel,"There are a lot of new games that features Ray Tracing on them as of now, too bad most of them doesn't look as visually as good as they could be though as most of the time their RT effects are dumbed down or reduced to the point it's pointless.  But the thing is that wasn't the point even from the beginning, RT Overdrive on Cyberpunk is literally considered as a Technological showcase  What matters here IMO for all of us is PC platform in general is showcasing here what a real high-end computers can achieve beyond what current gen console can do, and they are showcasing it really well here on Cyberpunk with much better visuals and using plenty of tricks to make them more than playable, where they shouldn't be considering how much demanding they are over standard, that is impressive enough to me and shows a good sign of technological engineering innovation.   As what Bryan Catanzaro said on his interview on DF Direct, work smarter not harder, brute force is not everything, of course it still matters a lot but doing it alone is starting to become pointless just like how it is on real life.",Negative

Intel,"So just to be clear, you don't like running games at native resolution? Because the purpose of DLSS is to improve performance by specifically not running at native resolution",Negative
Intel,Nice but ive been playing video games since the 70s and its Shit end off..,Negative
Intel,The future of frame generation is going to be huge. I can definitely see 360p frame rendering upscaled to 4k with 80% maybe even 90% of the frames being generated. All with equal to or even better visual quality.   A 20 FPS game like this will become a 100-200fps game.  We may be looking at the end of beefy graphics cards being required to play games. Just a good enough mid or low tier chip (granted 5-10 years from now) with frame generation might be enough.,Positive
Intel,"After 2.0, it's around 100""fps"". Just 60""fps"" (meaning with FG enabled) is far from being playable due to latency. You need at least 90""fps"" for playable experience.   Cyberpunk PT vs RT is a huge difference in terms of graphics, while DLSS Quality vs Balanced is really slim in comparison. What you say would be a really bad trade-off.   At 1440p DLSS Quality it's easily 120+""fps"" which is perfectly comfortable.",Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is greatly optimized. It looks fantastic for the hardware it asks. Starfield looks like game from 5 years that asks hardware from the future.,Positive

Intel,Pixar movies will sometimes take the better part of a day to render a single 4k frame on a render farm. So the fact that Cyberpunk takes more than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame in its path-tracing mode on a single 4090 clearly means that it's unoptimized garbage! /s  EDIT: Apparently people in this thread don't understand sarcasm (or don't understand how a path-traced game can take longer than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame with high-poly path tracing and still be optimized).,Negative

Intel,LOL I remember this exact scene also.,Neutral
Intel,"CPU PhysX back then was single-threaded and relied on ancient x87 instructions if I recall correctly, basically gimped on purpose. Even with a 5800X3D the shattering glass reduces the frame rate to the low teens.

Intel,"No, you could actually install two Nvidia cards and dedicate one of them to only PhysX.",Neutral
Intel,"It would certainly be possible, but it wouldn't really make sense. Splitting it up on multiple GPUs would have a lot of the same problems that sli/crossfire had. You would have to duplicate memory, effort, and increase latency when you composite the final image.  It may or may not make sense to maybe have a raster chiplet and a ray tracing chiplet on the same processor package on a single gpu. But, probably makes more sense to have it all on one chiplet, and just use many of the same chiplet for product segmentation purposes instead.   A separate PPU did make sense tho, I'm still annoyed that the nvidia ageia deal essentially kill the PPU in the cradle. Our gaming rigs would cost more if PPUs became a thing, but we could have had a lot better physics then we do today. There is still a revolution in physics to be had some day...",Negative
Intel,would be cool if 2000/3000 series users could get a small tensor core only PCIe card to upgrade to framegen,Positive
Intel,"That's true, but if he's talking about *the equivalent* of a current $200-class card, I'd say about it's 10 years, what do you think?",Neutral
Intel,At least with the 4090 you can run 70% power target and still hit insane FPS while only pulling around 300w which is the same as my old 3080. The gains with that extra 150w are a couple percent at best. Not worth it to me.,Negative

Intel,"They are still the same thing and should be named the same, your disclaimer is just semantics about the implementation.",Neutral
Intel,"Weird argument.  Traditional raster is cheats upon cheats upon cheats already.  In fact, all of the lighting entirely in raster is essentially cheats.",Negative
Intel,It will not work well/look good using a single frame worth of data either due to the low ray counts. Digital Foundry has shown Metro Exodus builds the lighting over ~20 frames or so and it seems like Cyberpunk is even more. Even Cyberpunk ray pathtracing doesn't look as good in motion due to that same build-up effect.  You need to cast 20-50x the rays to have enough data for a single frame but then you will be measuring the game performance by seconds per frame.,Negative
Intel,"RT looks significantly better than raster when it’s not just using simple reflections like a Far Cry 6. Raster is all cheats, the so called reflections are essentially rendering the scene or part of the scene being reflected in reverse then applying fake material effects to mimic metal, water, etc. Raster also takes HUNDREDS to thousands of person hours to get the fake reflections and lighting to look decent to good. That’s why devs love RT and want it to grow, as RT/hardware does the work for them.",Negative

Intel,It's not a perfect way of measure but you can clearly see how (at least on Nvidia GPUs) the 8/10GB cards are way behind the >11Gb cards.

Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090). That's substantially faster than than how fast a 4090 runs Cyberpunk on the path tracing mode.

My upgrade back then was to the Evga 560ti DS, which I ended up installing a backplate and  a gelid cooler. They had wayy better thermal tape/individual heatsinks for the memory/vram chips for the heat transfer.

Intel,"There was more nuance to that ""bugfix"" than just ""it was a bug that got fixed""   Modders were able to re-enable the AMD/NVIDIA PhysX combo basically immediately via editing DLLs.  Not driver replacements, but actual DLL tweaks.  The speed at which modders were able to fix what NVIDIA ""broke"" combined with the public outrage put them in a funny legal spot.  If they continued with PhysX disabled and claiming it was a bug then the bug can easily be fixed, as shown by modders doing it first.  So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.  Obviously not many modern games use the GPU implementation of PhysX anymore and the performance difference between current GPU and CPU implementations are negligible anyway, but their intent at the time was clear once it was shown how quickly modders were able to get everyone back to normal.",Neutral

Intel,"It isn't a weird argument. Rasterization is premised on approximating reality, while RT is simulating it.  The extreme few amount of rays we trace right now, including bounces, means effects are often muted and the performance hit is enormous. To compensate, we're using temporal upscaling from super low resolutions *and* frame interpolation.  Temporal upscaling isn't without it's issues, and you know how much traditional denoisers leave to be desired. Even Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction leaves a lot to be desired; the thread on r/Nvidia shows as much, with ghosting, artifacts, etc. all over again. It's like the launch of DLSS 2.0.  All of that, for effects that are oftentimes difficult to perceive, and for utterly devastating traditional rasterization performance.",Negative

I look at screenshots from cyberpunk, Raster / Ray Trace / Path Trace, and in most of them the raster just looks more interesting to me. Not constrained by what would be real physical lighting. The 100% RT render versions of old games like Quake gives a similar feeling.

In HDR that ""bloom"" looks awesome as it's super bright like it would be in real life but still not losing any details. You lose those details only on those SDR videos.  PT just looks and feels way more natural than just RT, when only raster literally looks like it was two different games from two different hardware generations.  Once I saw Cyperpunk PT there is no way I'd imagine playing this game in any other way. All other games look absurdly ugly next to it now.

The 4060ti gets 6.6 fps. Let's assume a next gen flagship is able to reach 60 fps at 4k. That would theoratically allow the 60ti card to reach around 20 fps.

But maybe DLSS 3.6 will solve those.  I do feel DLSS itself has also improved in the past few years in terms of ghosting and performing at lower resolutions.  On a 1440p monitor these are the starting point resolutions:  - Quality: 1707x960p - Balance: 1485x835p - Performance: 1280x720p - Ultra Perf: 853x480p  So even the highest quality option is sub-1080p.

Intel,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",Neutral

Intel,My point is if you've got nvidia card you simply use 3rd party soft and got everything and more. So comparing that AMD's software to Nvidia's is kind of meaningless.,Neutral
Intel,"I actually agree with you, but I don't need the metric to be some scientifically accurate reading of performance or whatnot, I just think it'd be a useful tool for adjusting game settings. For example, if I'm trying to optimize performance in a game, does this setting make CPU utilization go up or down? How much almost doesn't matter. Is there a bottleneck, where is it, and am I relieving pressure on it with these settings or not?",Neutral
Intel,It’s where you oc in adrenaline,Neutral
Intel,"There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Not because upscaling, but also because how important is to have drivers that work in tandem with specialized hardware units in the GPU.  Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  AMD fails hard on 2 of those things.  Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.",Positive
Intel,"Yep, XeSS is just great, I happily use it in MWII on my Arc A770. But I still use DLSS on NVIDIA. But both are better than FSR.",Positive
Intel,"Then you should be looking at ***GPU*** usage, because CPU usage will not help you answer any of those questions",Negative
Intel,"Problem is, by itself it still tells you little to nothing. If GPU utilization drops like a brick you know something is bottlenecking. If CPU utilization changes in the absence of other data you know absolutely nothing of value.   The real kicker is the CPU utilization may not even be ""wrong"", it may just be polling at a very low rate because that's the other thing with these OSDs if you poll too frequently for up-to-date data that can kill performance from the overhead.",Negative
Intel,"> There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  Yep, tools like [this one from NVIDIA](https://youtu.be/-IK3gVeFP4s?t=51) have made it easier than ever as a dev to optimise for NVIDIA hardware.  > AMD fails hard on 2 of those things. Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.  Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts. Arc is just getting started, give Intel 5-10 years of time in GPU and they will outpace AMD for sure.",Positive
Intel,"There are many settings that directly impact CPU usage, so of course CPU utilization reading can be useful.  Not everything needs to be precisely accurate, this is a lousy defense. Getting 0% reads all the time is entirely worthless but some accurate reads is still useful information.",Neutral
Intel,"You are going out of your way to defend a broken feature.    7800X3D shows up as 1% CPU utilization during games such as Watch Dogs, Stellaris, Age of Empires. Clearly broken. Undefendable.",Negative
Intel,"And with a bit of luck, they will also hit AMD in the console market.  Right now AMD stays afloat GPU speaking because consoles, they were during a lot of years the only vendor offering both CPU and GPU in a single package, reducing costs A LOT.  Nvidia was not able to compete against that with the lack of CPUs and Intel with the lack of GPUs.  Now that Intel is working on dedicated GPUs they are going to eventually create APU like products, its just the natural outcome of producing both CPUs and GPUs.  And then AMD will NEED to compete against them instead of being the only option.  And if that happens, unless FSR gets turned into a hardware specific tech like XeSS that falls into different techs depending on the GPU its running on, AMD will be murdered.  Better software stack, better general hardware to accelerate and improve upscalling keeping costs down AND being a second player pushing prices down towards Sony and Microsoft?  AMD will be screwed up if they don't up their game. And hard.",Neutral
Intel,"Right, so what kind of useful information can you tell me if I raise graphics settings and CPU utilization goes from 12-16% to 16-17% while framerate goes down from 120 fps to 110 fps?",Neutral
Intel,"All CPU utilization tells anyone is thread scheduling, and nothing about what the threads are or aren't doing. Like the only situation that it marginally tells someone anything is how many threads a program uses. But that usually doesn't fluctuate with games, games usually scale up to <x> number of threads and that is that. GPU utilization is the one that is far more useful for spotting bottlenecks, general performance observations are far more useful for tweaking.  Even Intel and co. will tell you that with modern processors and all the elements they contain as well as hyperthreading/SMT CPU utilization isn't a very useful stat anymore. Meant a whole lot more when CPUs were one core unit and didn't also include the FPU and memory controller and everything else.",Neutral
Intel,"Cause unfortunately even if it wasn't broken, it's not useful in any meaningful capacity. Should it be broken? No. Would anything notable come of it if it were fixed? Also no. Given the bugs they got and room for improvement elsewhere it's one of those things that should be super low on the priority list or just removed wholesale.",Negative
Intel,"That whatever setting you are changing does not have much of an impact on CPU utilization, and if your GPU allows, you can use it.  What is the purpose of this question, are you really not aware of any settings that impact CPU usage? Some RT settings have big impacts on CPU usage too.",Neutral
Intel,"The problem you're missing here is that settings that are CPU demanding generally don't have an easily observable impact on CPU usage, if they have any impact at all.  The reliable way to see if a setting is CPU demanding is to turn it up, see the frame rate go down, and then look at how **GPU** usage changed.",Neutral

Intel,"While I haven't used it daily or anything, and I've only done initial setup on the Lunar Lake, the feedback we've gotten both on Arrow Lake and for Lunar Lake (e.g. 268V and 265H) Dell models is that it's a big increase in battery life and performance. The integrated graphics (e.g. 140V and 140T) are very capable compared to a **workstation** grade NVIDIA Ada 500 GPU, but they are not even comparable to a gaming GPU like the GeForce 4060 or even a 5050.  The integrated graphics do however get used for 99% of all workloads unless explicitly specified because they are vastly more battery efficient and draw less power compared to a dedicated NVIDIA chip, meaning you can have a much smaller external power supply, and your graphics performance in those basic desktop workloads with one of these chipsets will be **much** better than previous generation Intel chips. Exceptions are obviously something like gaming or AutoCAD that specify to use the high performance dedicated graphics chip.  140V/140T are barely functional for modern AAA gaming, but if you stay 5-10 years back for AAA titles you might be okay. It will smoke most Indie games. Just look at the per title benchmarks for a 140V/140T and you can see if your game benches. You could probably get away with a lot of functional mobile gaming without a dGPU, but I wouldn't expect to be able to play a recent Call of Duty or Black Myth or anything with anything like an acceptable framerate at a decent resolution. This integrated graphics chip compares very favorably to its more common Ryzen 7 equivalent, I believe the 780M, and it's a very good APU for handhelds overall due Lunar Lake's power efficiency compared to other X86 chips.  You have to understand that for these next two generations Intel seems to be making big strides in terms of both power efficiency and integrated graphics for mobile, it's a very attractive option and the first time I've seriously considered a laptop without a dGPU. I think Panther Lake is going to be a very nice kit next year for both laptops and handhelds and give AMD a run for its money.   I suspect AMD genuinely needs a new APU graphics architecture implemented next year to keep up, which I expect them to. Not a bad problem to have.",Positive

Intel,> Source?   Common sense suffices. It's a tick core with a clock speed regression at that.,Neutral
Intel,"Surely a cost decision. The 4Xe die, including the choice of Intel 3, is supposed to be the cheapest thing to deliver an acceptable mainstream PC experience. They need PTL to be a proper volume runner and start displacing the RPL that's still a large chunk of sales. WLC should hopefully finish the job.",Neutral
Intel,Just get a Vision Pro?,Neutral
Intel,"Tbh, more cores would just make that go faster, but 16 would already be plenty. Especially for something like that where it's probably going to be a linear analysis and ram constrained if they actually modelled the gas (which would not necessarily be required).",Neutral
Intel,Lmao this is funny we both responded to the same comments with the same things within like 2 minutes of each other.,Positive
Intel,I don't see anything wrong with asking for actual benchmark information especially when there isn't anything official. X3D is nice but it isn't the end all be all. I would be curious to see if Intel can manage to compete.,Neutral
Intel,"Oh I totally agree, but it would've been nice you know? Jumping to 6 Xe3 is a  significant area increase for a tiny tile. I understand exactly why the 4-10 gap exists, but I can't say I don't wish there was something to fill that gap if only because it looks weird.  I expect the big CPU tile and small GPU tile pairing will find its way into a number of gaming laptops as the iGPU performance is pretty low on the priority list for those.",Neutral
Intel,"PTL's main changes are fixing MTL/ARL's terrible SoC design, which should net a few % performance. It'll see a mild IPC increase, getting a few more % performance. And it'll lose a bit of clockspeed, erasing most of those gains.  Expect PTL to be very similar performance to ARL, but with lower power consumption, a much better iGPU, and most importantly to Intel: Using their own fabs instead of TSMC.  It absolutely won't be X3D in gaming.  Edit: Actually shocked that people think this would compete with X3D.  9955HX3D is \~16% faster than a 275HX in gaming...and a 275HX itself is easily 10%+ faster than a 285H in gaming.  Not even Intel themselves are claiming this. Their own marketing refers to PTL as ""ARL performance with LNL efficiency"". Nobody realistically expects PTL-H to see a 25%+ gaming improvement over ARL-H. The fact that IPC increase is less than 10% and clockspeed is slightly lower than ARL-H should make this obvious",Neutral
Intel,CGC is a LNC tick. This is well known at this point. And we see it's even a clock speed regression.    Even entertaining the notion it will close the gap to AMD's X3D chips is just delusional.,Neutral
Intel,"Oh, yeah, I get you. Wish they could give more granularity. Just personally think some sacrifices are worthwhile if it can condense Intel's mobile lineup back down to something sane again.   > I expect the big CPU tile and small GPU tile pairing will find its way into a number of gaming laptops as the iGPU performance is pretty low on the priority list for those.  Yeah, should be a good fit. Shame they don't have anything with a bit more CPU umph, though. 4+8+4 and only up to 5.1GHz is *fine*, but not great. Especially without an HX replacement.",Neutral
Intel,"Two options seems right, either you care about it or you don't.",Neutral
Intel,"Its not ""delusional"" to want to see actual numbers instead of speculation. I have been in this game long enough to see plenty of speculation even with accurate information not give the actual numbers.",Negative
Intel,"Given how well ARL HX was received in gaming laptops, I think they may wait to have something from NVL take that top spot. 5.1ghz does seem low though. ARL-H will happily do 5.4 and 18A should clock decently, though I suppose that's a sacrifice for the 25W TDP.  I suspect these may not be totally final clocks though they do seem reasonable.",Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, surprised ARL-HX is doing as ok as it is. The deficits of the architecture in gaming are well known. If it could hit the same clocks and core counts, PTL should look a lot better still. And all that besides, ARL's cost structure is horrible. For Intel's own sake, the sooner they move on, the better.   > and 18A should clock decently, though I suppose that's a sacrifice for the 25W TDP  From the same leaker, these chips are at 65W or even 80W TDPs, so they're not merely power limited. It seems that 18A just significantly underperform some expectations, though in line with some rumors and the gist of the revisions Intel's been making to its projections over the last year or two.  > I suspect these may not be totally final clocks though  If they're defining SKUs and such, these clocks need to be finalized for all practical purposes.",Negative
Intel,"If I'm reading correctly those are max power limits, not the TDP,  though I get what you mean. The 285H sits at a 45W TDP and tops out at 115W. Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  As for why ARL HX is doing well in gaming laptops, I think a good bit of that is also part of what made it lackluster on desktop. It doesn't really scale up that well with higher TDPs and power limits, but it does seem to scale down. The 285HX with its 55W TDP and 160W max limit doesn't perform far off the 125W TDP and 250W max of the 285K.  It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system. The 9955HX3D is very impressive, but quite a lot of laptop buyers seem to value the ability to do more laptop-like things with their gaming laptops than the extra frame rate. I'm hoping this gets shaken up as AMD adopts new packaging tech as seen in Strix Halo.",Neutral
Intel,"> If I'm reading correctly those are max power limits, not the TDP, though I get what you mean. The 285H sits at a 45W TDP and tops out at 115W. Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  Not guaranteed given it's just a twitter leak, but I'm assuming the leaker is using the term TDP consistently with Intel's historical usage, i.e. PL1. For ARL, 115W is PL2. I would also assume there wouldn't be the disclaimer about it being hard to cool if they cut the PL2 so much, though PowerVia does create some interesting complications there, so maybe not quite apples to apples.  Either way though, don't think it should have much impact on ST boost. You're talking a good 70%-ish of power going to compute, so even at 65W PL2, that's still 40-50W available for one core. Should be *easily* sufficient to hit whatever the silicon is capable of.  > It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system.  Yes, and this is something I've very much looking forward to with NVL-HX. At this point, the biggest demerit of the -HX platform vs -H is the use of standard DDR5 vs LPDDR. That's because it's still based on the desktop silicon with the different SoC/hub tile. But with NVL using a shared SoC die, they should be able to offer an -HX platform with the core counts people expect (though probably limited to single die 8+16), but the power/battery life advantages of -U/-P/-H. In general, should help make the -HX more of a straight-up upgrade than the tradeoffs one faces today.  AMD has this situation even worse today, because there's a much bigger gap between their desktop SoC architecture and the mobile one. Though as you say, they may also bring them closer together in the future.",Neutral

Intel,"e cores are surprisingly powerful now, and games are getting more multithreaded. It might be better to spread them out over 8 less power hungry cores than 4 P cores and then spill over to the slower cores. Especially in a laptop environment where efficiency matters and the GPU is usually holding back gaming performance so much that CPU performance is really not that important.  In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread. But most importantly, it doesn't do so evenly. Maybe you don't need something assigned to e cores, or the e core task is light and doesn't hold up the other threads. Then things will run at the pace of the P cores, but every now and then you'll have a slowdown.",Neutral
Intel,Wonder if there's some energy star requirements.,Neutral
Intel,"Shouldn't be. That's what the math has always said.  As soon as software can scale to ""many"" cores, the tradeoffs that go into single powerful P style cores are a bad deal.

Gaming benchmarks tend to have a really strong feedback loop that favors last gen hardware design though.

Long term, an optimal Intel-style processor design will look something like 4 ""legacy"" P cores + dozens of E cores.",Negative

Intel,"12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark, like actually within error margins next to 7800X3D despite being an older platform with half the L2 of raptor lake and lower clock speed than even 7700X, shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much. Yeah 9950X should outperform it technically I guess but the split L3 between two CCDs probably holds back the advantage of having more cores.  Yeah sadly there's no benchmark for Bannerlord. But supposedly it does disperse its tasks to plenty of threads.   Here's some benchmarks showing core and thread usage in a few games. While the benchmark tool doesn't get into the details of how those software behave obviously, but at least according to the graphs some games like Tarkov really suck at distributing its tasks to several cores but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.

Intel,">12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark  It's because Creation Engine 2 worked better with Intel hardware until AM5 X3D chips, and 12900K great result in this test just shows that it's still a good CPU with 8 Performance cores, not that it's core count matters in any significant way - for example, 7700X delivers identical performance with lower core count/threads.  >lower clock speed than even 7700X  Clock speeds can't be compared between different architectures, different architecture = different efficiency, what matters is IPC.  >shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much  [here's a better example where more intel CPUs are present in Starfield test](https://youtu.be/XXLY8kEdR1c?t=29m5s), as you can see, increased core count/threads past 8 performance cores and 16 thread's is meaningless and won't provide any noticeable performance improvements, 6 faster P-cores on Intel 14600K provided better result than slower 8 P-cores on 12900K.   Going from 7950X to to 7700X results in 5 FPS loss, which is like 2-3% less FPS, and it's mostly because of lower clock speed(5.7Ghz Vs 5.4Ghz boost).   >but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.  That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.  Edit: typo",Positive

Same with Starfield.   That's because in video games, core count matters less than how fast the CPU can access or manipulate very dynamic types of data in a random memory address.    X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"". They're going to win in old or new games, and they're winning in games because they have a large buffer of low latency data.

Add cache to the chip for the iGPU to use (to make up for the poor bandwidth they get from LPDDR5, even with a wider bus)  If they don't do this then the chip (which again won't fit in their default socket) will be massively bandwidth constrained to the degree that it's pointless.

Intel,"No I'm talking about the internal game benchmarks they shared. Yeah the GPU architecture  itself is a lot better on paper, but they probably got bottlenecked by the low bandwidth of 128-bit LPDDR5. The uplift in 1% lows in some titles is impressive though.

Intel,"We already knew they cancelled desktop variants though, Panther lake was going to be around Arrow Lake laptop performance no matter what.",Neutral
Intel,"If people can get a XX60ti level iGPU in a laptop, which means you don't have to worry about MUX switches (hardware or software), possibly have a cheaper platform (if scaled) since you don't need a separate GPU board, have access to a ton of RAM (many mid-range GPUs are RAM limited), and due to reduced complexity and the ability to better dynamically manage power can get a more effective slim chassis with less throttling... then yeah, it'd be pretty good.  The next big jump is LPDDR6 which looks to potentially hit a 50% bandwidth increase and marginally lower latency.  Combine that with a wide bus and you're looking at enough to power a XX70 series mobile chip.  The framework is immature but it could be competitive in the future.  We'll see!",Positive
Intel,"Buddy, that's 140V with optimizations. They are telling you what they have done to further optimize their graphics, including drivers and power management. and that they'll further apply this in the future. Did you really look at the slide?",Neutral

Intel,"They've tested it with just three AMD cpus. Weird pairings. I would pair B580 with any i5 from last couple years. Seriously their testing is getting less and less ""real life"" and more for the purpose of a good clickbait.",Negative
Intel,"I couldn’t believe the video I was watching, the thumbnail was pure clickbait. They fixed one game, and improved some others a little.  And NEVER an Intel CPU in sight. I like the B580, but it deserves better ""testing"" than this.",Negative
Intel,The problem is still here. 9060 xt with 5600 is faster than B580 with 9800x3d and B580 still loses 8% with 5600 instead of 9800x3d. Which means that cpu bottleneck starts much sooner for ARC gpu.,Negative
Intel,"Is this related to historically Intel compiler not compiling code efficiently for AMD cpus? Does it also make Intel CPUs overhead better? If yes, then they really fixed something. If no, then they wrote code normally for AMD cpus as well as Intel cpus.",Neutral
Intel,"the B580 is a modern gpu, it should be paired with a modern cpu, preferably an Intel one, going with old school Ryzen cpus is a bad path to take.",Negative
Intel,"The problem is that this title makes it sound like they fixed the cpu overhead issue in every game, but that's not the case. Some games are still affected.

Intel,"These guys absolutely *refuse* to test with an Intel CPU, it's very weird.",Negative
Intel,"5700x would have made a lot of sense compared to 5600  12400f,13400f should be included as well",Neutral
Intel,Exactly. Its nice that some games were fixed but between that and calling the issue (entirely) fixed there is a big gap.,Negative
Intel,"Indeed and it is something very interesting, because the reason the driver overhead is an issue on 6 core cpu's is because modern games use all 6 cores, so if the driver has a big overhead the CPU has nu free cores available for the driver.  Especially Intel CPU's with more (e-)cores in their budget CPU's should probably suffer a lot less.   I would expect an i5-12400 to suffer the same as a Ryzen 5 5600,  But an i5-13400/14400 has an additional 4-e cores to deal with the overhead. The 13500/14600 even has 8 e cores.      I would very much like to see the comparison   i5-12400, i5-13400, i5-13500, Ryzen 5 5600(X)",Positive
Intel,Would not have mattered. the cpu bottleneck in the intel driver is single-thread limited and largely due to draw-calls being stored in system memory as a buffer for the frametime render. (at least as far as my debugging could lead me)  (that's also why its less impacted on ddr5 systems no matter what CPU),Neutral
Intel,"They pushed the 6 core parts too hard as ""good budget parts"" for too long to not keep using them as their reference...  Even when we're seeing games that now have strokes when they don't have 8 cores to play with.",Negative
Intel,"possibly. Honestly weird as hell to not through in intel cpu results with the same gpus so they can see if it's a all cpu overhead issue, or an issue with amd cpus with intel gpu. Like even one game if intel/amd gave about the same performance you could likely rule it out somewhat.  Also weird to say they fixed it if by the sounds of it to say it's fixed if a very limited number of games were updated to work better in also seemingly limited scenarios. That's more like finding a specific problem on a specific game they were able to improve rather than an underlying fix which if implemented should help everywhere.",Negative
Intel,"No, B580 also performed poorly on i5-8400 and 10400 (both are 5600X-esq)",Neutral

Intel,Welcome to the age of influencers...,Neutral
Intel,"Nvidia 5000 series has overheads issues even with 5800x3d... like 20% performance hit, you can fix it by capping fps or using Intel cpus. AMD CPUs always act weird when reaching 100% utilization.",Negative

Intel,Then they optimized drivers.,Neutral
Intel,Do you have peer-review data that confirms it?,Neutral
Intel,The video shows the B580 not having driver overhead issues with the 5600X but we don't know if it did previously on anything other than Spider-Man. His tone suggests the 5600X performance used to be worse but he provides no data other than Spider-Man to suggest it was for other games.,Negative
Intel,The fact that a switch from a 5600 to a 5700 with hardly a frequency gain eliminates the overhead issue suggest that is kind of  how games/drivers work.,Neutral
Intel,Which also fixed performance on 5600X,Neutral
Intel,"But that's now how games utilize CPU's.  What you get from games is usually 1 main thread that takes up one big core, then many less intense threads, that may or *may not* utilize the other cores, and to varying degrees. AKA you can have mainthread use 100% of core 0, but cores 1,2,3,4,5 are all 50% used, leaving 50% for other tasks to run freely.",Neutral
Intel,"Eventually you get the drivers where they need to be. People love to whine about Arc drivers but on the iGPU side people never complained. The community is never, ever happy with anything. Focusing their eggs on the Higher performance parts and then a slower LTS cadence keeping the old stuff alive is the right move.",Negative
Intel,"They will update, just not day 1 for certain games. Who's playing with integrated graphics?",Neutral
Intel,"cant say i blame them for scaling down driver updates for pre-arc graphics hardware, ever since they announced intel was getting into gpus proper ive been wondering how long it would take before this happened.  lets be honest no one was needing monthly igpu updates for 2021 hardware that was so underpowered it couldnt even tie with a GT1030 ^(\[why does everything come back to 14nm\].)",Negative

AMD,"Depends on price. Word on the street is that AMD gave Valve a reaaally good deal on 7600 dies.   Essentially it appears that AMD produced way too many Navi 33 dies, using an older node (6nm) to make them cheaper and more plentiful, expecting to put a lot of them in laptops. Apparently, OEMs preferred the more expensive (and more efficient) 4060 instead, and that left AMD with lots of Navi33 (RX 7600) dies on their hands.  Talking to AMD Valve probably saw an opportunity to take this excess capacity for cheap, and AMD saw an opportunity to recoup some cost, rather than risk throwing them away. I can imagine Valve getting those RX 7600 cards for maybe half the price of what a 9060XT would be (depending on memory prices).",Neutral
AMD,"Probably would have cost $100 more, but I think it would have been worth it. Almost PS5 Pro performance would have looked better. Plus better upscaling.",Positive
AMD,"All is forgiven if the steam machine is under $500. Anything more, and yeah, i agree.",Neutral
AMD,"Would have made a lot more sense.  Would have been first of it's kind though, no ODM with existing designs to produce the board, AMD clearly do not want this chip in anything other than add in boards etc.  It's strange since it seems like it would be a good chip for laptops, mini PCs etc.",Neutral

I told em valve is smart financially and will never do that and will just do the same exact thing as the steamdeck, pick an existing chip that AMD needs to dump off at an exceptional price. The 7600 system that's leaked will be what you see and what you get.  Well well it's almost as if that particular redditor does not have any business experience at all and valve is a multi billion dollar for multiple reasons including being financially smart.",Negative

AMD,Made the most sense,Neutral
AMD,Sure if its a really good price it makes sense..,Positive
AMD,"And for this, I expect Steam Machine to be in a reasonable price range. It’s the same for both Machine and Frame, there are very clear signs of compromises for cost purposes that Valve didn’t take for something like Index. The whole product was planned with cost in mind and while I don’t expect a subsidized price, I don’t think it’s going to be too expensive.",Neutral

AMD,"They're still selling 6600 new. And for some reason, 7600 never dropped to 180$ like 6600 did now almost 2.5 years ago...",Neutral
AMD,of course they did. They would have to throw away the 7600m dies otherwise because noone wanted them.,Negative
AMD,Eh. I'm betting on $600 for the entry level version and $750 for the 2TB version.,Neutral
AMD,"How is this even possible. The individual components today cost more than $500, not to mention the 2TB option will be easily more expensive than it was when the Steam Machine was first announced.",Negative
AMD,The fact that they’re using salvaged Navis means they’re selling jack shit 7600m dies. Which is to nobody’s surprise given how few laptops exist with 7600m. Oems do not want amd dgpus on their laptops.,Negative
AMD,This would make the SM $100 extra and for sure the CPU would have been a bottleneck for this card.,Neutral
AMD,Why?   This is a 1080p card.   8GB is sufficient for its performance.,Neutral
AMD,think thats why they did the rx 7600M,Neutral
AMD,"That's true. OEMs actually want this at least a little, unlike the old 7600m",Negative

AMD,"I saw an interesting video yesterday where the guy tested a Steam Machine-like config (6 cores, RX7600) to see how it performed and yeah... not good when RT involved at advertised 4k, Indiana Jones was unplayable.  Even non-RT loads required very low settings.  New games are going to really test that hardware, I think RT is a total non starter on it as well.",Negative
AMD,Exactly.  I wouldnt consider a 3060 useable without dlss working wonders.  Especially at 4k where you need dlss performance or ultra performance.  Trying to do that without a proper upscaler is going to produce hideous results.,Negative
AMD,"$1000 also isn't a great look for a console killer. Between Sony releasing the PS5 Pro at a really steep price ($750/€800), both Microsoft jacking up the Xbox Series price (X for $650) and Sony doing the same (PS5 for $550) and Nintendo charging quite a bit more for the Switch 2 ($450) I'd say there's an opening here for a Steam Machine to enter the console market.  If Valve can release something that can compete with these consoles, at a similar price, with a similar feature set, but with also all the advantages of being a computer, then it's definitely worth it. Going from $1000 to $700 will open a huge market for Valve. Going to $600 would be the nail in the coffin for Xbox.   No online fees, lower game prices, your game library will never expire, infinite game catalogue, and you can use it as your main PC as well, for the same price as a normal console... Not a bad sales pitch.  BTW, lots of people are using a Steam Deck as their main console. If millions are happy with Deck performance, this is more than enough. If you want better, build your own, unlike with classic consoles, you can easily do it now.",Neutral
AMD,I doubt there are enough defective ones to be all salvaged. It'll be like the consoles where they're cut back to ensure as many dies can be used as possible,Negative
AMD,"I'm hoping $600, unless RAM prices fuck it all up and it becomes $700-800",Negative
AMD,Valve isn’t buying individual components at retail price.,Neutral
AMD,More and more games demand RT and even software RT is vram heavy. Doom the dark ages can run much better on the 7600xt compared to its 8gb version even though they're the same card with only mild clock differences,Neutral
AMD,"If the 9060XT can utilize 16GB, so can a 9060. The performance difference is imperceptible without a framerate counter.",Neutral
AMD,"Plus, much easier to integrate into a smaller form factor than shrinking down a desktop GPU. The Steam machine is basically a screen-less laptop hosting a Ryzen 7640 (without iGPU) plus an RX 7600M, but with a huge-ass heatsink and fan to properly allow for higher clocks.",Positive
AMD,It's honestly hilarious. AMD will have zero FSR4 compatible mobile product at all until 2027 without hacky aftermarket solutions. Mind you laptop sales began to outpace desktop about two decades ago.,Negative
AMD,Remember KFConsole,Neutral

No , you re buying cpu, gpu, ram, ssd, mobo, case, power supply  Thats a ton of money.  And the performance wont justify the price at all.",Negative
AMD,"The 4k claim is really weird. On old games, sure. But am 8GB 7600 is a 1080p GPU, which isn't even that bad on a TV, especially since upscaling 1080p content is kind of a TV's bread and butter",Negative
AMD,"599 is ideal but I’d tolerate 699. Speaking of the RAM shortage, I get reminded of how Valve launched Steam Deck during the worst of COVID shortage, so I am somewhat hopeful",Neutral
AMD,"Cool, but individual components involve free assembly by you, steam machine needs assembling and to make money.",Neutral
AMD,"Slapping the chip from the RX 9060/XT onto a laptop style motherboard would not be technically any more difficult than using the 7600M chip. The 7600M is itself just a slightly cutdown, underclocked desktop RX 7600 chip.  Both chips are physically pretty much the same size (200 mm2 give or take a few) and the desktop versions have very similar power usage.   The only reason to use the RX 7600 over the RX 9060 chip in this application is cost.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah he mentioned that... result will be worse. 4K60 is going to be a very limited thing, marketing beware etc but I hope people are prepared for a little/lot of choppiness.",Negative
AMD,"Because of frame gen and upscaling, they can say it’s any output resolution any output frame rate and it’s technically not lying. It’s a useless piece of info without details.",Negative
AMD,"The steam machine doesn’t need to make money. The steam machine needs to get people to play PC games, which steam has an effective monopoly on. If Valve sells the steam machine at cost they’ll make money.",Neutral
AMD,"I agree, but it's still more work than just slapping the existing laptop board that's already engineered with the proper footprint, connections, inputs and outputs in there, because AFAIK there's no RDNA4 laptop parts at all and the most we have are the RDNA3.5 GPU in the PS5 Pro and the AI APUs",Neutral
AMD,Any corporate mention of resolution and framerate is completely meaningless now because it only refers the output. It could be achieved by upscaling from 540p and with 4x frame gen (amd doesn't use it atm) and it still wouldn't be technically lying.,Negative
AMD,Frame gen and upscaling can't solve a lack of VRAM in many games either though (frame gen makes it even worse). Unless they're talking about FSR1 lol,Negative
AMD,"Yes it does, it can't be loss leader because otherwise people will just buy it for office use. They said it themselves.",Neutral
AMD,"Who is buying a steamOS machine for office use? Which office is going to bother buying this instead of any of the hundreds or thousands of offerings from T1 SIs that actually provide support and service? This thing doesn’t even use standard components, are you even going to get official drivers on Windows?",Negative
AMD,"They promoted the steam machine as being able to install other OS. If they don't support it then I suppose at least it would be really funny for how much people glazed them for it.   There will be companies buying it if it's cost effective due to valve eating costs. Hell, even if they don't, valve just have no control over it's userbase, it could have a really low acquisition rate from non steam users, just like steam deck, so all that loss leading would be for nothing.  If you are right then it's a pc, that you can't upgrade, that can't play hugely popular games like league of legends, GTA, battlefield or valorant. Device designed not for casuals and not for enthusiast. Just people who are okay with paying a lot of money to play old, locked in time, singleplayer games on TV. It has to support windows.",Neutral
AMD,"No sizable company is buying a ton of computers to replace the OS on them, especially not for this level of hardware. No normal user is buying a Steam Machine running SteamOS from Steam because they really want a Linux desktop.  The problem with charging a PC price instead of a console price is that it’s just worse than an actual gaming PC. Even with all the advances Valve has made to Linux gaming you still can’t play a lot of popular multiplayer titles, and hardware wise it’s essentially a 5-year old console. There’s just no justification to pay more than $500-600 for one of these.",Negative

AMD,#1 usecase for these in AI is running medium sized MoE models for local LLMs.  And for that they offer a pretty compelling solution. You basically have to spend twice as much to do it with Apple.

AMD,"Companies are valued based on their gross and operating margins. If their costs rise, they also have to increase their sale prices by the same percentage, or those margin rates go down, which reduces the valuation of the company. Distribution and retailer also take a percentage of the product value as their margin. So even if the oem only raises the product price by the higher costs, retailers still increase the price based on the percentage increase.",Neutral
AMD,"The same reason Intel's Lunar Lake was a one-off.  Companies run a percentage profit margin they report to their investors. If they produce a good that costs 50$ to make, and sell it for 100$, then they have a profit margin of 50%. For investors this means that every dollar they put into production results in 2 dollars of capital, which is a good indicator for potential growth, and, of course, potential dividend payout.  If costs increase by 10$, then, if price were left unchanged, their profit margin would sink to 40%. if They increase their price by 10$ as well their profit margin would sink to ~55%. Investors will look at those numbers and conclude that the company is doing poorly: it is no longer able to achieve the same return on investment that it did previously, and they might just conclude that their money can be better spent elsewhere and cancel further investments.  So, a 10$ cost increase results in a 20$ price hike. In reality, profit margins aren't really that high for third-parties like Asus and others, investors can be persuaded that the costs aren't due to mismanagement and companies will take a hit in profitability in the short-run to maintain marketshare (although, again, AIB companies generally run razor-thin profit margins).  Another reason for adding margin to price-hikes is Machiavellian psychology: Gigabyte and others know the way the wind is blowing, RAM prices are going to keep climbing for the foreseeable future and people respond worse to smaller price increases every month than a big price increase every 6 months. So they'll add some padding now, 'worst' case they can drop the price later or give greater discounts during sales, best case they're better insulated from any future inflation.",Neutral
AMD,Money. Corporations are evil and not your friends,Negative
AMD,">Why does Asus, Gigabyte, etc, get to make $30 more profit when they spend $20 on memory?  Why not?  They operate based on profit margins.  If they're earning a 50% profit margin, then a $20 increase in input costs will result in $30 increase to the selling price.  Plus, just because NAND contracts went up by $X doesn't mean that's what it costs manufacturers, because they're still bidding against each other for actual supply.  If they don't wanna sit there with 0 stock for the next 6 months, they'll need to bid up the price even higher.",Negative
AMD,Because that’s how margins work.  It’s not sold directly from the manufacturer.,Neutral
AMD,"Because they have to maintain profit margins. They aren’t going to take a hit to margin just cause the materials got more expensive.  If you only raise the retail price by the same amount of the cost of building the card increase, then your profit margin decreases.",Neutral
AMD,"Input costs only determine the viable price floor.  The market (buyers) determine the price. They can all increase prices $50 because people will buy it. They’re also now making more profit per unit which nearly always offsets the loss of customers.  Imagine their costs are $80 and they sell for $120, that’s a $40 profit and a 50% return. Costs increase $20 to $100, price goes up $50 to $170, and all of a sudden returns are 70%, and profit per unit has almost doubled. They can sell almost half as many units and be behind in revenue but ahead in profits, which is the most important part.",Neutral
AMD,They have a legal obligation to make as much money as possible. Gamers have shown since the crypto eras and onward that we’ll pay more for hardware than they thought possible. I just saw a whole thread from someone who bought a 5090 to game casually on non-graphically intense titles and do office work. We’ve signaled to these hardware companies that PC gaming is a luxury.,Neutral
AMD,They don't. The OEMs buy kits that contain both the GPU die and the memory. AMD charges the OEM a margin on top of the kit cost. AMD and Nvidia typically don't change the margin target when the BOM increases because they typically don't need to do so to meet sales targets.,Neutral

AMD,"Margin. They are targeting a fixed margin (measured in %), not a fixed profit per card (measured in $$). They just had an earnings where they said they want very high margins.

AMD,Because you'll pay for it anyway,Neutral
AMD,"When prices go up, demand goes down, so they're going to sell fewer units. They need to increase price more than their increase in cost to make up for the lost volume.  This is a fairly straightforward optimization problem. Total profit = per unit profit \* volume. There's also a tradeoff between per unit profit and volume: The higher the per unit profit (and therefore sale price) the lower the volume, and vice versa. When per unit profit is zero then total profit is zero, and likewise when volume is zero total profit is also zero. Somewhere between those two extremes there's a point of maximum total profit. Because per unit profit is price - cost, a change is cost is going to have a relatively larger effect on per unit profits, possibly even putting it negative without a price change. This will cause the optimal price point to move towards higher per unit profit, lower volume. This is what causes the price to go even higher than just the increase in cost.  Thinking of it as greed isn't helpful. This is a very straightforward logical deduction. They don't need increased costs to be an ""excuse"" to raise prices, they can do that anyway and they were already doing their best to optimize their price for maximum profits before.",Negative

Another important thing: it means that if you can spend the additional 10 billion on something with a profit margin of 6%, you should cut production in half and do the other investment instead.

AMD,"I'm not sure I like that table analogy. To me it's like you're building a table for 8 hours and getting $200 in labour and praying $100 in wood, tools, etc. you'd probably charge $300 for the table. $100+$200.  33.3% is your cost in parts, and 66.6% is your profit margins that is also your hourly pay in a way.   Now imagine your parts cost went up by $100 to $200. Do you now charge $200+$200? (You pass the cost onto the consumer) Or do you charge $200 for parts/supplies plus ANOTHER $400 for the labour, because you think the 100% increase parts/supplies cost also justifies you getting a 100% hourly wage increase. After all, you want to maintain the same 66.6% margin. $200-$400.   I think in a small business like this, that would be insane to demand you get double the annual revenue and profit margin in salary. If I went from 66k a year annual net income to 133k, because my supplies cost went from 33k to 66k, that would be weird. Now admittedly, you'd sell a lot fewer tables, so you'd probably not hit those yearly goals. But in part that's your own fault for doubling your table sale price.   The second you have investors, it's suddenly justifiable though. Which to me makes the system look broken.  Personally I think what's going on is that that WANT to sell less gaming GPUs. Just like in the example above you might want to sell fewer tables. AMD is filtering their RDNA4 supply to server instead I'd guess.",Negative
AMD,"But at the quarterly reports they do report other numbers.   ""Third quarter revenue was a record $9.2 billion, gross margin was 52%, operating income was $1.3 billion, net income was $1.2 billion""  I believe by maintaining that gross margin of 52%, all those other numbers will go way up, as a result of more cost, while maintaining margin.",Neutral
AMD,"""making less than before.""  Bubble is saying price was originally sold at $100 if it was $20 in parts it goes up $10(imagine no other costs).  Why don't them make it $110 instead of $150.  You are thinking that ""they don't expect to sell the same number of them"" so that means it shouldn't be $150, as economies of scale are smaller so it should be $170 instead.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, fair that. It's all about the what companies think the price elasticity is for their product. If we increase our price by 10%, is loss in number of sold units big enough to make our actual profit/revenue smaller than before the increase? It's all a big guess.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah for me I’m coming from a discount 3070 so I can almost justify the price as is. If $699 holds thru December it becomes $665 factoring in chase 5% PayPal used at Walmart.

AMD,"You analogy makes even less sense, and keep mixing up what you're actually calculating, and muddying the water by adding the materials in there. My point was that it's fair to ask for more money based on how much you've invested, be that either time (hours worked) or money (buying materials)      Philosophically: If my profit margin is 100% based on the labor, an increase in cost of materials has no impact on it.    You ALSO forgot to account for the cost of you time, i.e. how much are these 8 hours worth if I'm not building this table. What is 8 hours at minimum wage? What's 8 hours working for somebody elses company worth? This is opportunity cost. You're just assuming the labour is 100% profit, which breaks real-word profitability analysis.    To make it fair, you should be calculating the cost of hiring someone to build the table, and you then sell it. You're not going to have 66.6% profit margins.  Anyway...  If the parts cost goes up to $200, and my hours worked stays the same, an absolute minimum price would be $400. And especially if you market your services as ""no profit on materials, only work"". You might do this, because sales/VAT taxation reasons like if materials are taxed higher, but labour is lower. So you give a receipt for materials, bill them as paid-for (0 profit) and then bill your work.    This way of doing things, your profit margin technically doesn't change, since the material is expensed at-cost, your business is selling your labor. You're just expensing the materials, not selling it to the customer. It's almost a balance sheet transaction, that doesn't appear on the P&L.  So no, it has nothing to do with investors, it has to do with you disregarding basic finance and looking at labour as free.",Negative

AMD,What is up with the different visuals at the same settings between the cards? The AMD version seems to be missing or have downgraded visuals.,Neutral
AMD,"Well, it seems AMD has something... Sarcasm aside, nice to see DF's input on this 'early look' of FSR RR.  A lot of strange things observed. With the same settings AMD has some things omitted compared to Nvidia, as seen with shadows in a distance, it's quality, as well with objects reflected like with lights (can't say for sure if this an AMDs or dev thing, regardless it doesn't matter to the end user to who's fault).  With FSR RR, the most noticeable spotted difference from at first glance is the retrieval quality and AA from the reconstructed/regenerated scene. DLSS RR is better which shouldn't be shocking. This is due to how AMD does their upscaling passes with RR, as you can choose whatever upscaling method you want with RR and how it can be clearly seen with water reflections. FSR4 Perf is noticeably blurrier than FSR4 Native when comparing the reflections in the water, while it wouldn't matter what DLSS quality setting you use in conjunction w/ DLSS RR. As an aside, I found it interesting how FSR4 Perf had better texture detail on the letters than DLSS4 Perf (that said perhaps could be a sharpening thing outside of the upscalers used).  Moving on, FSR RR has missing features as noted with how reflections should be reconstructed. Reflected objects/scenes do not correctly diffuse, and are sharp throughout (typing this, I use [10:20](https://youtu.be/RuASMLRGFus?si=p1ECIQiTwNLLxeT0&t=617), but interestingly enough w/ DLSS RR, the gun has noticeable artifcating maybe due to the denoiser?). Environments with FSR RR do not have correct contact lighting as seen with the part about the trash can.  AMD does have some things going for it (though, I suspect is more per game basis). In motion, DLSS RR while clearer experiences more ghosting/smearing elements compared to FSR RR. That said, can't be said for the disocclusion aspect as seen with swapping guns with water in the foreground (that said I wonder if this is again the same problem with the upscaler/denoiser pass with FSR RR or if the problems with game settings between AMD and Nvidia has something to do with it like SSR).  There are things to note about performance, but isn't wildly different, so I won't make comments there.  Overall, again strange to say the least. It's obvious FSR RR isn't quite done, which can be worrying considering it's still one part of Redstone. Also, the game itself isn't a good test bed for the feature (as if it only being enabled for MP wasn't obvious enough) as there are bugs and instabilities. I guess, if anything, AMD has a step in the door which will have improvements. That said, isn't quite like with FSR4 in terms of wow. Not only that FSR4 can easily be swapped with Optiscaler and recently in AMD's own driver with most DX12 games. This one seems to be dependent on AMD actually implementing it with games so unless there are workarounds no DLSS RR swapping with FSR RR.",Neutral
AMD,"I was hoping Ray Regeneration was going to be a simultaneous denoising and upscaling approach, they were [investing research in it](https://gpuopen.com/learn/neural_supersampling_and_denoising_for_real-time_path_tracing/) and suggested they had something working in [an admittedly artifact-ridden demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0vLil19mBs&t=21s). Instead this seems to be a spatiotemporal ML denoiser. It's completely decoupled from upscaling so appears to be denoiser pass before upscaling which ends up cutting out high frequency details and reconstructing to a lower res so you don't get that sharp DLSS RR resolve.   At least in it's current form it's not really an effective competitor to DLSS RR, rather it's competing with standard denoisers like NRD. Which makes me worry about adoption - NRD is vendor agnostic, as are most denoisers. I doubt this could be injected generally like Optiscaler since it is decoupled from upscaler outputs and probably designed to run in it's own pass. Maybe it could be modded to run on DLSS RR inputs before upscaling if the algorithm is general enough? While I hope it's better by Redstone showing I don't see how they could improve the detail reconstruction if it's acting before upscaling  Edit: not to undermine what has been achieved here - it's a very competent denoiser, and imo beneficial over COD's default at identical cost. it just doesn't push any boundaries whereas DLSS RR remains surprisingly coherent when reconstructing small RT details or high gloss reflections",Neutral

It was then around when Avatar released FSR FG was solid and at the time in terms of performance was quite competitive with DLSS3 FG's HW accelerated Optical Flow overhead.  Reality is, no one should really expect AMD to have Nvidia features day one or even have parity. It is more so that AMD should have a relatively decent cadence to have said features so that buyers aren't left out.  I am curious on what they have to say. To me RR seems to be more involved than upscaling and FG as there are already a lot of routes for the developer to take to implement the slew of upscaling methods.

AMD,"Which differences specifically? Most of it is probably down to difference in FSR and the denoiser. The softer look of the water on the AMD card actually looks more realistic, you dont get super sharp reflections on water like that in real life.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm guessing the issues with contact hardening is mainly down to how the network was trained, reconstructing glossy reflections from low sample counts in real-time is challenging and one where DLSS RR is obviously better. Because it's denoising at internal resolution, the start of the hardening penumbra will be be softer than DLSS RR even if it should be sharp. Compared to the in-game denoiser I think FSR RR is actually mostly beneficial (except the water which has had all the ripple detail removed and the extreme ghosting with gun disocclusion) and it seems to be free, although DLSS RR isn't horrifically expensive on newer cards. I'm hoping this is a stepping stone to a simultaneous denoising and upscaling solution because the magic of DLSS RR is it's ability to reconstruct sharp ray traced detail even at low internal resolution, something that this multi pass technique probably can't do (although it can be made sharper, [NRD managed it by denoising with a detail recovery pass that respected DLSS jitter](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/NRD?tab=readme-ov-file#improving-output-quality)).  Optiscaler is magic in getting FSR4 in most titles but I fear this technique won't see much adoption at all - denoising passes aren't typically general so this is something that would need per-engine integration. I suppose it could intercept RR inputs (assuming there's equivalent) to do one pass denoise then standard upscale but unless the inbuilt denoiser is terrible it's probably not worth it",Neutral

Yeah, AMD fans call this ""fine wine"" but the truth is you just didn't get what you paid a premium for, for months and they thank AMD for it.  Reflex 2 is starting to be in the same category of bullshittery, they marketed 50 series on a feature that isn't out in any games and it's been almost a year without the feature. The only difference is NVIDIA won't push out a feature unless it's ready, whereas AMD force it out when its half-baked like Anti-lag which got people banned from online games or as Firefox72 said FSR FG which was broken in a bunch of games on release.  Either way, I was hoping AMD would move to making their features feel more premium by only releasing them in a very polished state, but nope, once again they rush features out and then get destroyed for it by the tech press.

I would not even say the drivers are AMDs issue anymore, they are not, or NVidias drivers have gotten worse anyway while AMDs opensource support for instance is top notch, so in the end how much is a feature worth to you how much are you willing to pay!

Now, they apparently have figured out that at the moment, releasing half cooked things to the public keeps them at least in people's mind and gets them mind share, criticism and bugs be damned.

AMD,"Funny enough, Asrock just mentioned FSR 4.1 on Twitter.",Neutral
AMD,"It's worth noting that Blops7 only has the RR and FSR4 parts of it, and that RR is not on a version 1.0 yet. Redstone should include the following according to AMD:  * **FSR Upscaling:** (Formerly AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution) Reconstructs crisp, high-quality visuals from low-resolution frames.  * **FSR Frame Generation:** Predicts and inserts new frames between rendered ones, delivering smoother and higher frame rate gaming.  * **FSR Ray Regeneration:** Infers and restores full-quality ray-traced detail from sparse samples, delivering sharp, noise-free visuals with reduced rendering cost.   * **FSR Radiance Caching:** Dynamically learns and then predicts how light propagates through a scene, delivering efficient real-time global illumination.    Of these, we already have FSR4, though a 4.1 or something could come out with this. Ray Regen was the new thing previewed in COD so far. We have yet to see FSR4 Frame Gen or whatever the ML-based solution will be or how their radiance caching implementation will differ from Nvidia's.",Neutral
AMD,"Just an important note, BLOPS7's version is listed at .9, so it's possible (or likely) that the official release will bump the version and may have other changes.",Neutral
AMD,"Nvidia has 2 Ray reconstruction versions. The improved CNN model one and the more recent transformer version. The transformer RR is amazing and by far the best denoiser available for video games. The CNN version is overall better than regular denoiser partly because regular denoisers look flat out awful (it's hard for devs to make denoisers), but CNN version does have compromises and some implementations by devs aren't as good as others.   Unlike Transformer DLSS upscaling the RR Transformer model is very punishing on Turing and Ampere but runs very well on Ada and Blackwell.",Positive
AMD,"Thanks for the helpful post, i recommend checking out ImgBB for posting photos. Imgur is cancer.",Positive
AMD,Some other features are more relevant than ray reconstruction as RT is so rarely used even on more powerful nvidia cards due to how extremely taxing it is. Most of use is on older titles with few gens of hardware advancements. Latest games can butcher even RTX 5090 into sub 60fps with DLSS.  Redstone should bring other improvement than this as per older AMD claims,Neutral
AMD,"Not gonna happen, all those are Nvidia sponsored titles (maybe not Indy, I don't remember about that one). Redstone will probably come to Cyberpunk a year after its release and it will be the worst implementation possible. Optiscaler will very likely make Redstone compatible with those games long before their developers do.",Negative

AMD,So it is a RT/PT specific upgrade to FSR4?,Neutral
AMD,We have path tracing at home.,Neutral
AMD,Is it possible to upgrade the RR version to transformer like DLSS or are you stuck with the version the dev used?,Neutral
AMD,"Ugh this again. On average modern RT (not PT) isn't really all that taxing on modern hardware. Now we have games that are built with RT in mind, have no legacy raster path and run well even on a 2060 Super like Indiana Jones TGC and Doom TDA. You gotta remember the RT in these games have to run on a PS5 which is weaker than a 2060 at RT, some even run on a series S, hell Star Wars Outlaws has **several** RT effects running on a Switch 2!   If a Series S and Switch 2 can do it how the hell can modern PC GPUs struggle with it. Now if you wanna min max and drop your settings to achieve 200+ fps that's fair but that doesn't mean RT is gonna make a modern GPU explode.",Negative

AMD,"At least not indiana jones, that has locked dlss inputs, so unless theres official implementation, there will be nothing",Negative
AMD,"But like the other user, most people forget it exists.",Neutral
AMD,It's not hard at all to support this. Takes some dev time but is basic engine plumbing. What is hard is implementing the real time path traced renderer that these techs are designed to support.

AMD,"I would still argue it can be (implemented) inefficiently, not for 200fps but for APUs or even to extend say the handheld/Switch2's battery",Neutral

AMD,"by hard I meant the incentive for dev to do it, as AMD only makes up a tiny fraction of players, and dev time to add it is more or less the same as DLSS, so game studio would just be ""nah just do DLSS and 90% of our player will be happy""",Neutral
AMD,"There's obviously a negative connotation in that comment, as if AMD planned this release to coincide with the price increases. Also a negative inference that somehow the price increases are unjustified.",Neutral
AMD,"You're delusional if you think people don't play with RT on AMD GPUs.  I have a 9070 non-XT (albeit BIOS-modded and disgustingly overclocked, so about on par with an XT). I always turn RT on, and I tend to max it out without issues. I play Witcher 3 maxed out at 1440p with RTGI and Optiscaler FSR 4 at about 90 FPS base. Enable FG and it's hitting my monitor refresh rate, with the base framerate high enough that the input lag doesn't feel bad.  Even Cyberpunk is fully playable with path tracing if you're willing to drop down to FSR 4 balanced. It sits at around 45-60 FPS, or around 90-110 FPS with frame gen. Obviously path tracing doesn't look all that great without an ML denoiser, but it's completely playable with PT on, and will look absolutely stunning once we get RR on AMD, not to mention feel even better if NRC works in the game, since it should yield a 20-30% boost in PT performance.  And remember, a 9070XT will do 10-15% better than my 9070, so RT is absolutely being used on AMD.  Also Lumen sucks ass. It looks worse than proper hardware RT and is only popular because UE5 is popular.",Neutral
AMD,"Unfortunately lumen costs nearly as much as RT and arguably looks worse in every way.  Not sure that makes much sense. Also I don't even get this reply. I said what it is and you say ""and that's enough"". No shit it's enough. I asked you what magical thing you dreamed up that it also had.",Negative
AMD,"Lumen is RT though, but because it's software based it's the worst of both worlds. Massive performance impact while it doesn't even always look better than good raster. The temporal accumulation need for Lumen also brings with it the worst ghosting ever. Low fidelity software RT is absolutely not the future.  In games that actually have hardware Lumen the performance is only slightly worse on good RT GPUs while the visuals are massively improved. In theory at equal visual fidelity hardware Lumen would give you much better performance than software Lumen. That's just common sense as you have extra hardware to accelerate it.       In the couple of games with mandatory RT that have a software fallback you can see that performance decreases significantly when you fall back on the software version.  Epic knows software Lumen sucks when GPUs have good hardware support for RT (afterall there's no reason not to use dedicated hardware) so they're already shifting towards defaulting hardware Lumen in the recent UE5 versions",Negative
AMD,Lumen has both software and hardware implementation. Lumen software implementation is a lot more taxing than ahrdware RT and is in fact advised against. To the point where the latest Unreal version has it off by default.,Neutral

Then take any more recent game: https://ibb.co/4wxJjMx4 or https://ibb.co/3yhTtMvw or https://ibb.co/1YxcVNZq and it falls apart, which is where highest player counts are, not in the 2 GPU gen old titles (or even older such as Wicher 3).

AMD,Feature parity with Nvidia while also providing more VRAM,Neutral
AMD,Not targeted to you specifically but that's been the obvious sentiment regarding this manufactured outrage,Neutral
AMD,"I can very much read, thank you.  9070 does fine in pretty much any RT title, benchmarks show as much. It beats the 5070 in RT, but also has enough VRAM to fully leverage the power it has available for heavy RT.  Your examples are Black myth: Wukong, AW2 and Indiana jones, and only with the most extreme RT settings. The most similarly priced Nvidia card, the 5070, performs worse in two of those three titles. In Wukong, where it's beating it, it's still delivering unplayable framerates due to the fast-paced nature of the game.  It should also be noted that your example benchmarks were produced on PRE-RELEASE DRIVERS. Those same prerelease drivers had launch FSR 4, which had a much higher latency penalty than it currently does. Current drivers have brought huge performance boosts, something like 10-15% over launch performance, even accounting for outliers.  Those performance gains have been especially big in RT games, where the base 9070 tends to beat the 5070 across the board now, while it was hit or miss at launch.  Like yes, the 5070Ti is still objectively better for RT than the 9070 XT, but it's also 25% more expensive. That still doesn't make the 9070 XT a slouch. It's still better than a 5070 in RT pretty much across the board, even where the 5070 isn't being strangled by the 12GB VRAM buffer.  Driver optimizations like opacity micromaps, shader execution reordering, neural radiance caching and an ML denoiser will only ever close that gap to the 5070 Ti further. Admittedly OMM and SER isn't hardware accelerated like on Nvidia hardware, but should still yield decent uplifts. NRC and ML denoising should both bring double digit performance uplifts, however.  People forget that on a pure hardware level, the 9070 XT has 5-10% more theoretical RT compute than the 5070 Ti. It just lacks the software feature set Nvidia has, and a few hardware-accelerated refinements, notably OMM and SER. It is not inconceivable that the 9070 XT could reach parity with the 5070 Ti in RT.",Positive
AMD,"I believe in the first 2 it's modified to even use hardware Lumen. As in the games don't ship with it supported nor did the developers put it in. And the last one is outer worlds 2. Which is known to run like garbage. Note the 50 to 60 fps with the GPU at 35 to 50% utilization.  I don't think these are representative of the overall usage of hardware RT.  Software Lumen tends to look very ghosty especially on foilage and lacks detail, especially in AO.  It's also screen space limited.",Negative
AMD,"Time to bring the receipts.  Software Lumen: [performance2-3840-2160.png (560×1450)](https://tpucdn.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-performance-benchmark/images/performance2-3840-2160.png)   Hardware Lumen: [performance-3840-2160.png (560×1450)](https://tpucdn.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-performance-benchmark/images/performance-3840-2160.png)  A whopping 7% drop in performance for hardware Lumen on a 5090. Thanks for the example. It illustrates very well what I'm talking about. From what I've heard the hardware Lumen in The Outer Worlds 2 is broken but usually it looks significantly better than software Lumen. I think most people would gladly sacrifice 7% performance for that, because usually the difference is like low vs ultra graphics. No massive Lumen ghosting either.  It's funny you talk about AMD not being good at RT but in this game a 9070xt loses less performance than Nvidia: [performance-2560-1440.png (560×1450)](https://tpucdn.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-performance-benchmark/images/performance-2560-1440.png) vs [performance2-2560-1440.png (560×1450)](https://tpucdn.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-performance-benchmark/images/performance2-2560-1440.png) so they're losing 3% performance at 1440P.  It's not that RT doesn't cost a lot of performance it's just that software Lumen is just as expensive as it's wildly inefficient. The 5090 does indeed struggle at native 4K, but it struggles in general and hardware Lumen has nothing to do with it. With how dominant UE5 is you can't actually avoid RT at all so it's funny that you call it a niche feature. It's like I'm arguing with someone from 2020.",Neutral

Also Oracle is assuming OpenAI will be able to hold up their end of the deal to have the future cash flow to pay off the debts. Because if/when OpenAI collapses, then Oracle may actually face debt default risk.

At any rate, what I described still kind of applies even without a VRAM leak.

Software support is just not mature enough with most approach still just trying to parallelize one task even well beyond reasonable scaling, making large core counts seem useless.  Once core counts where naive scaling approaches break too often become common, we'll start to see a shift revealing more benefits of having a lot of cores. Task preemption which was the foundation of modern complex systems may be eventually demoted to a last resort solution for keeping misbehaving processes in line.  Spreading processes to different cores generally reduces the peak performance requirement, so cores can be operated at a lower frequency, with lower voltage greatly increasing efficiency.  Tasks sticking to specific cores without getting preempted and moved around also increases efficiency, and reduces the occurrence and impact of worst case latency penalties.  Software is just way too behind hardware, but throwing faster hardware at the problem still works, so problems are not getting fixed. For example it's amusing to see that single CCD AMD CPUs are the most common for gaming, not because they are good enough, but because dual CCD CPUs just perform worse for the average gamer.  A Linux gaming setup with a container and/or Wine limited to a single CCD with the other CCD being used for the rest of the system is the superior approach to Windows bloatware services and background processes competing with the game for the resources of the same CCD, but the later is what's the easiest to setup/get for most users, so that's what they will plan builds for.  A lot of games also just spawn one software thread per hardware thread per thread manager, which stops reasonably scaling after a point. It may be worthy to even attempt to lie about having only 8 hardware threads, then spread around the mess on 8 cores with SMT more efficiently handling the overcommitment.

In heavy RT loads tho even the 9800x3D gets pummeled due to the infinity fabric constraints (see: Outer Worlds 2) once the cache fills your memory gets thrashed and FPS goes to toilet.   If they can get the new sweet spot with infinity fabric to, say, 8000 MT/s then even with Zen 5 cores in the thing you'd see pretty big perf gains just by that alone.

For many cloud use cases, this is a good trade-off in exchange for essentially lower cost per CPU core; I'd say somewhere between 2/3 and 3/4 of general purpose cloud use cases are not performance sensitive enough to need full P cores or those with high clocks/more L3/more ST performance.

AMD,"There's a performance benefit to keeping everything else away from the CCD occupied by the game. There aren't a whole lot of people remaining who close everything else anymore when starting a game, and starting from (late?) Windows 10, it's even hard to get rid of a lot of unnecessary background tasks.  It's a bit hard to judge objectively though, because Windows doesn't have containers necessary for proper testing, and Linux is already often faster even without scheduling changes, so it's not feasible to compare the two platforms. A Linux test with one CCD disabled, then both enabled but the game constrained to one CCD could be interesting, but then Linux on its own isn't heavy in the background, so the test would be greatly affected by the choice of extra programs running, where heavy hitters like Discord would start favoring the 2 CCD setup significantly.  I'm not out of touch with more budget conscious people, but if it wasn't obvious, I wanted to point out that even the people who typically spend a lot more of minimal or only perceived benefit go with a single CCD this time, because on their setup (typical Windows gaming), 2 CCDs actually result in worse performance.  It's on software even to the point of Intel attempting to help the industry with best practices: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/optimizing-threading-for-gaming-performance.html (although this one gets more specific to their architecture, even if it still mentions concurrency limitations).  We are talking about the same scaling issue. A specific workload may scale reasonably up to 6 cores (and even that's 1-2 cores for more specialized work), a lot of code still just looks for the number of hardware threads, and creates the same number of software threads to be used in a thread pool specific to a layer, so in total the whole program will typically have more than 2-3x software threads than hardware threads available. This way you can even end up with more cores resulting in worse performance, even though they could be used to tend to the excessive number of software threads with less preemption, and therefore higher performance.",Neutral

In any case, by the time AMD was taking onto R&D for anything Ryzen in 2012, their financials actually mostly recovered through external investments and the aiding console-deals (Work on Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One began around 2010–2011) … These ""peanuts"" of their custom-semi division mostly saved their day-to-day.

Samsung GDDR became king when you could no longer mess with voltages and straps. Tends to scale with temps compared to Hynix, so you can play with temperatures to get better results.

For servers performance per watt matters, but for things like offices you might deploy 30k units. People work maybe up to 8hrs a day, and that’s assuming their entire day is actually at a computer. Most people still work 5 day work weeks though 6 is becoming more common in corporate America.  That’s a ton of idle power consumption, and a lot of excess heat HVAC’s spend time pumping out of the building.  Intels prices on low end computers is also really low.  So there’s no value to pushing AMD hardware in these places when it costs more per desktop and more to operate.  Hopefully AMD works on their idle power consumption in the future.  I love my AMD AM5 desktop but when building a home server I couldn’t justify an extra 15-20W power consumption, especially when energy prices are going up, and IMHO will keep climbing for a while.

This chips can run Windows 11 just fine for a everyday usage (browser, some apps, Office…) but they excel as NAS, homelab servers… where they shine given their TDP, performance and QSV  I understand why AMD isn’t interested in competing in this “low TDP low profile” category, and it’s because the margin is very low and they can’t justify fill TSMC or GlobalFoundries nodes with this kind of chips orders.  Even Intel can’t, and that’s why they only make them with their own capacity (N100s aren’t produced externally) and that means they are now in a slow path of upgrade until Intel internal nodes update (meantime, Intel is ordering TSMC some of their higher end processors parts)  I would love AMD being able to compete and make something like a low TDP x4-x6-x8 APU for like 50-70$ the CPU (more than that would be out of market compared to N100s)",Neutral

I kid you not, EVERYTHING you do makes all 4 cores go 100% full tilt. Even opening a new tab in a browser is a struggle for this CPU. I literally spent 2 almost full days just doing the normal Windows updates you have to go through when installing Windows these days.

Unless you are playing a niche game, the cheaper CPU that is still great in 99% of cases is a far better buy and then invest that money into a better GPU.   You can buy a CPU+Motherboard bundle over at microcenter with the 9700X for $340. The 9800X3D bundle is $530. That's $190 more. Now outside of circlejerking benchmarks what do you actually get for your $190? Nothing compared to what a $190 better GPU you can buy.  Same thing with Intel. The I9 Arrow lake CPU is a terrible buy compared to the 265K. In every case the 265K Paired with a better GPU is going to win for gaming.  Now if you don't give a fuck about price and are just going to buy a RTX 5090 anyways then this is a moot point, but most people I would imagine are not doing that.

AMD,"1) The N150 is part of the same family, just a little bit “overclocked”. It isn’t a literally a new gen (same socket FCBGA1264, both based on Alder Lake cores, even if they have different naming (Twin Lake) because the dates of launch) but a “refresh”. It doesn’t have anything “new”.  And that’s logical. As I explained, this CPUs have a very thin economic margin, so they must use internal capacity of their nodes. And they still haven’t upgraded them since the N100 introduction. Also, the making of new e-Cores (again, given they won’t invest a lot on them given the margins) isn’t coming before 2026-2027 as earliest.  2) The N100 family runs correctly. Heck, I’m using in a desktop a N6005 (with Fedora I must say) no problem, playing 2K YouTube videos, sometimes +30 tabs, and mild multitasking (browser + another browser + Libreoffice)  I don’t know how your experience is even possible, 4 cores at 100% opening browser? Slow? It isn’t certainly the usual experience even if using Win11  I would say something else is at play, like low RAM availability (4-8GB?), slow SSD, bloated Windows or something else.  You can see benchmarks, the N100 is about the same performance as an Intel i5 8250U, and I know people even using that at their workplace no problem. Something is up with your PC, not the CPU.  In any case, I recommend you running Linux with this low resources things and avoid Windows 11 bloat.  3) That AMD you link has worse iGPU depending what you do (Intel QSV for encoding/decoding is miles ahead of AMD), and anyway, its GPU isn’t really a factor given at this performances you won’t be gaming precisely.  Also, it will run hotter and have a TDP about x2-x3 of the Intel. So I think now we’re not talking about apples to apples, but apples to oranges.  I have a Intel Nxxx that even runs passively cooled without problem, no fans, no noise, and it does its job perfectly, for about 150$. But if you are OK paying around 25-40% extra (+75-100$), more TDP, fans and so on, then yeah, you can go with a AMD Ryzen 5 APU  And if you’re OK with adding a bit more, you can even go with an Apple Mini using a M4",Neutral
AMD,"A legitimate point, but it does mean that there's substantial flexibility. AMD's content to slowly increase their market share while reaping pretty fat margins overall, but if they had an incentive to really push for more volume, they could get it.   Worth noting that Intel's TSMC wafer allocation is almost as large as AMD's, last I heard. At one point, even expected to be maybe the 3rd largest, iirc.

But that's the whole point, it HAS the power when it needs it. When it doesn't, it's pretty frugal with its power usage as well.  I'm not a fan of ""just barely enough power"" when it comes to PC components. I despise e-waste, so yeah, you might find a purpose where the N100/N150 is just barely good enough, but when your needs change, or when things become more demanding, it's for the trash. That's why I don't get ""barely fast enough"" components any more. You're getting frustrated in the short term, and creating unnecessary e-waste in the long term.

As I said, I run a N6005 as a daily driver just fine and plan to do it for some more years, even if I also have an AMD 8600G desk, because less noise, electricity needs, heat… to do the same basic tasks. Obviously if I needed to run a heavy software I would use the 8600G, but that’s not a daily need in the slightest. In fact, I have even thought about selling the AMD PC (more so because I play less and less) but given I would need to sell it at a discount, and all the job of getting a buyer and so on, well… I’m lazy I suppose.  And about he money, IDK where you live, in parts of Europe you can find a N100 mini PC for about 130-160€ even with RAM and SSD included, new. I got my N6005 for 80€  An AMD 5560U mini PC (Beelink?) starts at 300€, about double.",Neutral
AMD,"Mostly because if you lump all those in, the category ceases to mean anything useful. At least from AMD and Intel's perspective, that's basically the same as the mainstream consumer market. And if that *is* what you want to talk about... why not just call it that directly? The only reason to specifically call out ""professionals"" would be to distinguish it from the rest of client.",Negative
AMD,"> Then again, something is up with your setup, because your experience is not the usual with the N100 chips.  Nope. This is not my first time with this class of CPU. I've had plenty of N class CPU's before, back when I thought I could make it work.  The thing is, having ""barely enough"" only works until you need more. And in that case, in any case, you're better off with a CPU that CAN deliver more, rather than one that can't.  I usually shop Mini PC's on places like Ali-express, the price difference is more like $50, all else being equal. And for that kind of money you get something that won't magically turn into e-waste next year, or whenever your needs change. And is nice to use until then.",Neutral
AMD,"Maybe buying from Ali is not the best.  As I said, no matter what, your experience is not normal. Millions of this devices are being sold no problem, and just as you have your experience, I also have mine equally valid.  I didn’t saw it until now, but look even the upvotes/downvotes in your comment and mine (I didn’t downvoted you), your experience of “N100 is trash and goes 100% all cores just opening Chrome” is not normal.  IDK what RAM you were using, its size (I know the N100 with 4GB RAM is hell, but 16GB RAM is smooth), what SSD (some QLC literally crawl after some mild usage) and so on.

AMD,Id assume that would be more then enough? I have a 9950x3d and my coolers a thermal right phantom spirit evo 120mm and avg 70 or 80 C i believe,Neutral
AMD,"For gaming 9800X3D is faster. If you need the 4 extra cores for work, that makes sense.  I'd get a Phantom Spirit 120 instead of the cooler you selected, but the cooler you selected will cool a 9800X3D/9900X3D.",Neutral
AMD,"Add others have said, the 9900x3d is in a weird place because it's outperformed in games by its little brother the 9800x3d. Go with the 9800x3d or the 9950x3d if you need the cores for productivity tasks. The 7800x3d is also a very good option that will likely perform no differently than the other two if you're playing in 1440p or 4k.",Neutral
AMD,Yes.  But why?  Peerless Assassin SE cools more and costs 1/3 of that Corsair.  An AIO generally wont leak on you unless you somehow cut the tubes.  AIOs also have much larger thermal capacity which means you wont hit throttle as fast and cool off faster.

AMD,"I see, happy to hear  Thank you!",Positive
AMD,"One of the previous commets informed me that the 9800 is better, i thought the higher the number the better it usually is😅  Thank you!",Positive
AMD,"The reason i didnt go for the peerless assassin right away is because i can probably only get it through shipping and i generally prefer to buy it from a store i know, not a dealbreaker just a mild prefrence  While i know that aio's dont leak normaly it just scares me having something in my pc that if leaks will fry my build, even if the chances are very low, a bit of paranoia i guess you could say😅  I will check the video out, thank you!",Neutral
AMD,the 9900x3d is worse lmao,Negative
AMD,oh kewl,Neutral
AMD,"You can do that but coolers such as the Phantom Spirit are so easy to install. It’s not like 20+ years ago where they are clipped in and you risk cracking the die. But, since you seem to be getting a whole setup (new CPU means new mobo and in your case new ram), may as well get the shop to do it all since you don’t have experience.",Neutral
AMD,You're welcome,Neutral
AMD,"It depends, for gaming in this case it's actually worse.  For some professional applications, it often is.  If this is a gaming build, 9800X3D is the obvious choice.",Negative
AMD,"The way the cores are placed on the chiplets the 12 core is worse because you will either park half of the cores, turning it into a 6 core cpu or you will have cross talk between the caches on different dies, which just kills performance. On productivity applications this doesn't really happen since the code is very deterministic, but games with user input are not. So any advantage the additional cores will give you will be negated by the interconnect. So single ccd 8 core is much better. Especially with that 3dv cache which games just love.",Negative
AMD,"Oh lol, what a unique way of naming products",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, if i go through with this im probably swapping almost everything in my pc besides my gpu and power supply, seems best to leave it to someone who knows what theyre doing😅",Neutral
AMD,"Its isn't worse in general but worse for gaming.  9800x3d -> 8 cores with the 3d cache  9900x3d -> 12 cores total, split into 2 groups of 6 each. Only one group has the 3d cache, so its worse for gaming.   9950x3d -> 16 cores total, 2 groups of 8 each, one group with the 3d cache. So same for gaming as the 9800x3d with extra cores for productivity",Negative

AMD,9950x3d is 200 eir more at leasy where i live,Neutral
AMD,Yeah but it’s definitely more worth it over the 9800x3D if you’re working AND gaming,Positive
AMD,op didnt specify so i didnt recommend,Neutral
AMD,I personally would change out the 9800X3D down to the 7800X3D and use the savings to upgrade the 9060XT into a 9070.,Neutral
AMD,You do NOT need an X3D CPU with a 9060XT 16gb rig unless you are near a microcenter and opt for a 7600X3D in a bundle deal with a motherboard for max savings. A 7600x/9600x CPU will serve you just as well and you can get a 9070XT with the money you save.,Neutral
AMD,"The GPU will bottleneck the CPU, I'd move some of the budget over if I were you. Overall good build though",Neutral
AMD,"aliexpress is currently selling 7800x3d for 200d, they're having mass sales on it",Neutral
AMD,Spending more on a CPU than GPU is certainly a choice.   Get a cheaper CPU and better GPU.,Neutral
AMD,"For modern gaming focused builds, if your GPU isn't your most expensive part then you're doing it wrong.  As others have said, go cheaper on the CPU, 7800x3d would be the top end of what you'd want until you get into high tier gpus. If you can find a microcenter or even order from one, the 7600x3d bundles are a great option that will let you spend more on the gpu and have a better experience.",Neutral
AMD,If its for gaming I would do a much worse cpu and much better gpu,Negative
AMD,The heat sinks of Patriot Venom kits have been falling apart according to newegg reviews. In this market you can't be too picky though. There was a Sillicon Power kit available today which was slightly beter at  the same price. Decent chance it's gone though.  Phantom Spirit 120 is the slightly better successor to the Peerless Assassin and costs the same.  I agree with the other poster about a better GPU and worse CPU - but if this is PC exclusively for competitive shooters at 1080 this might be fine. :P,Negative
AMD,Link? Shows 500 for me lol,Neutral
AMD,"Have you turned on the bios?  If not, reflash and reset.  Let us know if this doesn't help.",Neutral

AMD,"I'd favor the PowerColor.  Sapphire, PowerColor, and XFX are my preferred brands when it comes to AMD GPUs as they tend to have the best combination of reliability, customer support, and ""bang for your buck"" (particularly with their lower end models).

AMD,"i have the asrock but i say go with whatever is cheaper powercolor,xfx & sapphire has some of the best look amd gpus",Positive
AMD,personally go with whatever cheaper but i like my card smaller so reaper is my choice if same price,Neutral
AMD,The one without the 12VHPWR arson connector.,Neutral
AMD,Neither   Both are same specs...so follow whichever design you like best.  I'd likely to go with Reaper for AMD cards eventho I have Steel Legend Dark,Neutral
AMD,Sapphire notro+ is good,Positive
AMD,Why?,Neutral
AMD,Which card has that?,Neutral
AMD,The pulse is better since it doesn't have the 12vhpwr connector,Positive
AMD,challenger has worse build quality and even the higher end steel legend from asrock has a worse cooler than the powercolour,Negative
AMD,The challenger in my opinion is better looking and runs cooler but the reaper supposedly does slightly better in gaming. Not sure how true that is but either way they're the same price.. pick which one you like. Both are good,Positive
AMD,Pretty sure both of your options.  Can confirm the challenger card since I just bought one.,Positive

AMD,Setting up adrenaline and getting some what familiar with it can be confusing at frist put u gonna get the hang of it.  The settings describe what they do and are overall simular.,Neutral
AMD,"I once upgraded from Nvidia to AMD and felt the same excitement. I made sure to enable SAM, updated drivers carefully, and tweaked Radeon settings for smooth 1440p gaming. Performance surprised me.",Positive
AMD,"yeah 9060. ram seems like it might be problematic for a longer time, so i'd grab the gpu before its price starts going up (this is why i bought recently). and i guess i wouldn't buy ram now.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, after I typed it all out I was thinking 9060 XT 16GB and grab another 16GB RAM before the prices get even more stupid",Negative
AMD,"Basically, very basically, there are 3 types of technologies for ssd:  QLC, TLC, TLC with dram. QLC is the lowest quality and is usually to be avoided. TLC is high quality already, the dramless variants are even better and should be used for important stuff.  Pcie3.0 is kinda old (but still ok if you have an older ssd), Pcie4.0 and 5.0 is good with 5.0 being the newest.  For office work and gaming all these ssd are so fast you won't see relevant difference.  Crucial P510 is TLC dramless, while Crucial T705 has dram, so it should be a bit more expensive. Both options are good.",Neutral
AMD,"Unless you have specific needs, there is no point in paying extra for Gen 5.0 drives. 6000 CL30 is the sweet spot for RAM.",Neutral
AMD,"Name come in different length sizes, check that both on your motherboard fit with the ones you selected.",Neutral
AMD,4 TB SSD if you are planning to record at all. 2 TN if you are just playing.,Neutral
AMD,Honestly PCIe 5.0x4 is not needed and runs hot as has been said. My picks are Samsung 990 PRO and WD SN850X for high end no compromises storage. For gaming it hardly matters. Any decent TLC NAND drive is fine. You mostly have to look out for things like shit drivers and problems with the controller.,Neutral
AMD,Bro the prices have been increased a lot for ram and SSDs and also I heard GPU prices are also gonna hype I was also thinking about building my High end gaming pc but after hearing this I am relying on my old one to does not give me any problem as no parts are available for consumers in the market right now. You cannot even buy a single ssd or ram stick at a reasonable rate.,Negative
AMD,I'm chipping in with a question. What's the purpose of ram in an SSD?,Neutral
AMD,"I forgot to add that these are both the same price aswell, roughly $5.   and apparently the T705 despite quicker and DRAM. It does run hot a lot. I’m not sure if these people are transferring a lot or what but I’ve never had heat issues with anything even my 9 year old PC now.. so I’m hesitant when people add ‘not an issue if you manage the heat’ because I in fact have never ‘managed the heat’ so I was thinking maybe just go the slower that has no mention of running hot and at face value won’t seem any slower?   Sorry if I speak in layman’s terms.",Neutral
AMD,Pcie 3.0 is still fast as fuck,Negative
AMD,"Ah yes that was a mistake I do in fact have the 6000Mhz for the Vengeance, thanks.",Positive
AMD,"It's an additional buffer where data can be temporarily stored. This results in overall less erase/writing on the NAND flash, and so a longer lifespan of the drive. It also allows for faster data transmission in some way.

AMD,The Crucial T705 is fast. Like super fast. So it's expected to run hot. But it should be fine for normal usage,Positive
AMD,"That heat only happens when you are writing to the drive or reading a lot. For gaming and normal usage, you won't have to worry about it.

AMD,"Prebuilts are completely fine and I’d honestly recommend it. Dealing with all the parts, and assembly is way too much of a hassle for me.

AMD,"I wouldn't get a 3080 in 2025.. but I guess if you found one for really cheap, go for it.  A 12 GB 4070 is just as good, and it has the added benefit of coming out after the mining boom (plus it uses less power).",Positive
AMD,Buy a 850w or 1000w PSU…,Neutral
AMD,Go with a 4080 Super or a 5080 for the GPU. Whichever is cheaper. For CPU get a 9800X3D. I would also recommend a 850W power supply so you have room for upgrading it later with more/stronger parts. Also just use W11. W10 would open you up to more security risk,Neutral
AMD,Replace that 3080 with a 5080 or a 5070ti and your good. Don't skimp on CPU either.,Neutral
AMD,"Don't skimp on the PSU, that's what will power and protect all your components from any possible power surges or brown-outs. You also want to have some power headroom, just in case you want to upgrade in the future, 750W will probably be fine, but I'd push for an 850w one just in case. You're also going overkill on the Motherboard, a B650E or X670E type board should have you more than covered for the foreseeable future.   Something like this should have you sorted and leave you with budget for a very nice monitor and peripherals:    [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/mRkMRV](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/mRkMRV)  You can obviously go for upgrades in the CPU and GPU department as your budget allows. If you're mostly focused on gaming, the biggest focus should be a GPU. A Ryzen 9600x CPU should have you more than covered for pretty much any game, and then go all-in for the GPU.",Neutral
AMD,Get a Bari sax,Neutral
AMD,"I would swap out the cooler to one of the Thermalright ones. They're about half the price and just about the same performance.  See if you can find a motherboard with B650E, X670E, X870, or X870E chipset. They all have more PCI-E lanes. Not a huge deal either way.  Samsung 990 Pro is like the go to most gamers but any speed after PCI-E Gen 2, you get insanely diminishing returns compared to 2.5 SSD to M.2 nvme jump. I personally went with a much cheaper drive with no heatsink and used the one that my motherboard came with and it was a PCI-E Gen 4 drive. I think MSI Spatium without the heatsink and it was under $100.   Memory: is so expensive right now. You're paying 3-5x as much as you would have last month. I got a 32 GB kit last month for my brother at $140 and that same kit is over $400 now. I would see if you can maybe find a kit on FB marketplace or something. And try to get CL30 and 6000mhz if you can ideally.   GPU: for a $3K build, that's weaksauce. Go for at least the 9070XT. Asrock has their 9070 at $600 right now and PNY has a 5070 Ti at $700 on Walmart online.  If you do decide to get a better GPU, you'll have to make sure to get the appropriate wattage PSU. I'd go for a 850 or 1000 W regardless to future proof it and be able to use it again in future builds.  Lastly, please don't pay full price for a Windows license. You can buy a W11 Pro license for less than $20. Stacksocial has it for $10 right now. https://www.stacksocial.com/sales/microsoft-windows-11-home-3",Neutral

AMD,"If you suffer from ""too-many-tabs syndrome,"" don't get the X3D, get the X variant of CPU (personal opinion). I got the 9800X3D, but I feel it struggling to do too many things at once.  Most games are not CPU limited anyways, and the extra multi-tasking headroom will help when you have 26 wiki tabs open while in-game  If you have the budget to spare, go with 64g RAM for future-proofing and even more headroom.  RAM prices are kind of crazy rn though because ""google search 5.0 + chatbot"" (that they're marketing as ""AI"") needs a lot of memory, allegedly.  also, do yourself a favor and make sure the lego pieces match on [pcpartpicker](https://www.pcpartpicker.com). It also has pricing at a glance  PS: it is now Black Friday season, so don't trust that AMZN has the best prices. They're usually good at price parity, but MicroCenter has ""open box"" discounts; and you have to shop in-person for the BF sale prices; which may be lower than AMZN",Neutral
AMD,"Pretty good build. I Assume you already have a keyboard, mouse, and speakers since you didn't add it to your list.   If it were me, I'd try to budget for a 9070 XT over the 9060 if possible. I'd definitely aim for a 32"" 1440p instead of 27"". You'd very quickly get used to the size.    3000 USD is about 4225 Canadian.

AMD,"Yea I wouldn't use the exact parts PCPartPicker suggests, it was mainly just for the spec parameters they provide in the list.",Neutral
AMD,5090 is so far and above in expense compared to any cpu that saving maybe 1-200$ at most on the cpu isn't going to be enough.,Negative
AMD,The 5090 market right now is not what it was 2-3 months ago.  They are not readily available anywhere for a good price.,Negative
AMD,Can you use it? Sure. Will you get support / security patches? No,Neutral
AMD,"I never said you can’t, I just said you want to use win 11.",Neutral
AMD,"It’s not a bad idea to find a prebuilt you really like, ask the community where it falls short, and then just order all the parts (replacing the weak points with better components). If 50% of the prebuilt is quality, you are half way there easy",Negative
AMD,I mean once you go past 5k there isnt really much point  a 5k pc and 10k pc are both fine with a 5090,Neutral
AMD,"I don't see down votes or people ""blasting"" him, but a lot of advice and build links. The sub is fine.",Neutral
AMD,"I mean I agree with that, I think it’s 5070ti/9070xt or a 5090",Neutral
AMD,An oled would be nice  There is an Asus Rog strix  27 inch oled that is all the rage rn but it is just as expensive as a 5070ti  But a worthy investment,Neutral
AMD,"I feel bad now bro. I just read the last sentence before your spec list. Sorry bro.  I'll link that ibuypower pre-built I was talking about.  Spec one out with the same or similar parts if you want to build it yourself.   If you want to build one yourself, stick with reputable companies like Corsair or Seasonic for power supplies, Corsair or G skill for ram, Samsung, WD, or crucial for nvme/ssd. MSI or Asus for mobo.   I prefer Nvidia over AMD when it comes to video cards, personally. Just watch or read a couple comparison videos or articles about the pros and cons of each.   https://www.ibuypower.com/store/rdy-element-9-pro-r07  Good luck bro.",Neutral
AMD,"Can't speak on the ssd, but as far as I've seen, ram is pretty negligible of a difference for any cl number. No real reason to pay more if you dont need to and won't notice a difference.  And the slight bit of info I know on ssds, is ive seen even sata ssds do well enough to where you won't notice a difference haha (for gaming anyway). If the temp on this one runs hot though, definitely may be better to switch to another nvme. OP might have 3k to spend, but doesn't mean they should. More money could go to the monitor. Gpu, cpu, and psu are probably the main components you get right. Everything else is kinda negligible. Getting the premium parts for the other stuff is personal choice ofc. Nothing wrong with getting the extra 5% performance if you want it.",Neutral
AMD,Whoever can get this dude the help he needs😭,Neutral
AMD,I’m about to dm everyone,Neutral
AMD,Don't be. Investing in stocks without knowing what you are doing is WAY worse than buying a PC with the same lack of knowledge.  Nvidia is extremely overvalued.,Negative
AMD,"Make sure before you actually spend that money, you do some research. Don't jump the gun. With 3k you can build a monster PC",Neutral
AMD,"Tbh homie just build a 5070ti for 1440p for like 1.5k and spend the rest on a desk, new mic, keyboard, nice mouse etc",Neutral
AMD,You can get a 9070XT for ~ 600 or a 5070Ti for ~ 750. Both of those are excellent 16GB cards that will carry you to 4k 60fps or whatever fps you want at 1080p.,Positive
AMD,That’s not knowing that’s just not caring. you didn’t even care to research,Negative
AMD,"Budget in the link is $2200, OP’s budget is $3K. If they can save $200 from the CPU, that gets them a 5090. Again, screen resolution/refresh rate is a huge factor here.",Neutral
AMD,"Ouch, I hate this market.",Negative
AMD,"For starters Server 2022 gets updated until 2032,",Neutral
AMD,You don’t see downvotes? He said he might go to Best Buy “geek squad” and got curb stomped. Then he said microcenter is too far a drive and got stomped again. lmao,Negative
AMD,Don’t feel bad bro atp im pretty sure I deserve the flak for the terrible build😂 I’ll keep the pre-build up for when I go to micro center🤙,Negative
AMD,"Yea, No. Trying to save $7 on ram in a $2000+ build is stupid. The V color stuff uses Hynix dram as well. With a 3,000 budget you have enough money to buy pretty much whatever the hell you want except a 5090. Your trash kit doesn’t just have high latency it’s slow clock speed ram as well. All for a pretty pitiful amount of money saved. If it was $80-90 cheaper you might should consider it.  I’m not suggesting premium parts, I’m suggesting not to use trash parts that will gimp performance for literally no reason.  I came out with $400 to spare with an oled - https://pcpartpicker.com/list/vcG8np",Negative
AMD,I dm’d you,Neutral
AMD,"Keep in mind, ram prices are through the fucking roof right now.",Negative
AMD,"Too bad the jealous scum bags in this thread are shitting all over him.  He has the $ and comes here for knowledge, the clowns on this sub have the knowledge but no funds and can’t stand seeing someone else with the $ to build a beast PC ask for basic help. Getting slammed for not knowing the right GPU for his price bracket lmao. Respect to those excited for the bro and actually offering help. 👍",Negative
AMD,"Actually two, if the research and sales timings are good.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah you can build a 9800x3d and 5070ti for around 2k so with 3k youre looking at a 5080 if you want. Hell, maybe even throw a 9950x3d in there while youre at it lmao.",Neutral
AMD,Taking it slow and getting as much advice as I can. Might run to the geek squad at Best Buy before Black Friday,Neutral
AMD,Great advice honestly,Positive
AMD,Pretty sure op is including the price of a monitor in his original 3k budget which will easily fill it up if he gets an appropriate OLED monitor with a little wiggle room.,Neutral
AMD,Why would you run server on a workstation opposed to windows 11?,Neutral
AMD,I mean rightfully so lol. He should get an internet curb stomp for wanting to geek squad it lol,Neutral
AMD,"Im not OP, it isnt 'my kit'. Ram just isn't a big deal. To be fair to you, I did miss the speed on the one listed there. I just assume 6k lol. So ill take the L there. The latency is definitely negligible though.",Negative
AMD,Slightly unrelated but... the number of incredibly stupid people that are really really rich is too damn high... you would be surprised how many people are rich that make you wonder how did natural selection NOT consume them?  How the fck did they get rich ? Luck probably i guess  But seriously how is it fair that a lot of rich people are stupid but alot of poor people are smart?,Negative
AMD,"Look up if you have a microcenter near by. The employees are genuine, the company is good and the customer service is top notch. I would send my mom in there to buy a 3D printer and have no doubt they would steer her right",Positive
AMD,"Don't bother with GeekSquad, plenty of information online. RAM is super expensive right now, I recommend getting a 2x16GB 6400 kit for this build. Could easily add 2 more 16gb sticks later if you feel the need to upgrade",Negative
AMD,"If you're in the US, go to a microcenter if you can bear you. They are a lot better at giving good advice than geek squad.",Positive
AMD,Check for a microcenter near you. Best advice you will get here.,Positive
AMD,"Hmm, I think you’re right, I missed that. I always assume $3K at a PC is talking about just the tower, but to a lot of newer people they mean the entire setup. Yeah, a 9800X3D is fine for 180Hz, but I agree, they should get a QD-OLED monitor. It’ll make the cinematic games look amazing",Neutral
AMD,"Less bloat, and can have more control over the OS   I'll probably be going back to Windows 8 soon so.",Positive
AMD,"not when the person flat out and upfront admits he doesn’t know jack about computers  > I mean rightfully so lol  alright, well congrats for being part of the shittiest flaw in this subreddit. ppl come here and get their hand held building a rig, and then have an armchair PhD in CPU architecture 😂",Negative
AMD,"I agree on the latency. 9800x3D won’t care that much, difference would be negligible. Maybe 1 fps if that, biggest impact would be 1% lows where I still wouldn’t expect a large difference. It would be less negligible on a non x3d but I wouldn’t pay a large premium to get cl30",Neutral
AMD,"Bet you think you're very smart, but there's no outside confirmation 🤣",Neutral
AMD,Rich doesn’t mean they know everything. If you’re that much smarter than OP you’d probably know this yeah?,Neutral
AMD,Closest one is a hour drive😭,Neutral
AMD,"two is better, getting those 4 sticks to run 6400mhz stable wont be easy if at all.",Positive
AMD,lol my man you taking Reddit too serious haha. The fact that you are being offended on his behalf is crazy. Kid hadn’t even said anything about being discouraged lol,Negative
AMD,Are you aware of the saying that goes something like... Human intelligence is finite... but human stupidity is infinite lol,Neutral
AMD,"Who the fck said anything about OP? I didn't say shit to the OP hence why i said ""Slightly unrelated"" at first and went off to rant about something that's kinda related but not directly towards OP  It was literally nothing personal here which is what i said literally at the start of the reply with ""slightly unrelated""",Negative
AMD,Thats not very far lmao,Negative
AMD,I would do literally anything to live an hour away from a microcenter haha. And I live near Seattle,Positive
AMD,Worth it. Take 3k there say that’s ur budget and u will walk out with everything,Neutral
AMD,"It’s so worth it dude. If you have a car you should definitely do it, especially for such an expensive build. I messed something up on my motherboard when I was building my pc, and they replaced it right away without even using the warranty.",Positive
AMD,It’s worth it. Better than geek squad — it’s an entire store built around these hobbies,Positive
AMD,Check out [logicalincrements.com](https://www.logicalincrements.com/) for a good idea of what a baseline level build for every price point looks like.,Neutral
AMD,"You're looking to drop 3k on a Pc build, an hour drive (2 round trip) is WELL worth it.  I live about an hour and a half from one, 2 in peak traffic, and I drove there to buy my 3D printer instead of ordering online.",Positive
AMD,"It'll be worth it. They can also put it all together after you pick the parts with them.  I haven't used that service, but I believe they also have a warranty associated with that service.",Positive
AMD,"Haha this made my night! First I'm like, ""bro, why are you suggesting a Microcenter very few people live near one."" And then you're ""bro, it's an hour drive!"" Haha  Good luck on your build, bro. I'm sure they'll take care of you. They'll even build it for you if you want.  Damn, I wish Fry's Electronics still existed. I would drive an hour just to look at all the cool shit.",Positive
AMD,Bruh that’s close,Neutral
AMD,Lol what I drive an hour to work everyday,Neutral
AMD,Do the drive tbh. You’re going to get better deals and see lots of components that might catch your eye. I would trust them more to build the pc than Geek Squad tbh,Positive
AMD,"Two is better, but 2x32gb 6400 kits are like $400 right now. 4x16gb 6400 could easily run at 6000",Neutral
AMD,"Offended? This isn’t even about me. I’m embarrassed if anything. This sub used to be one of the best social media resources you could use when building a custom PC. From the live interaction, to the 15+ years of archived info you can pull from. He’s probably not discouraged because he found out real fast the quality of help he’s going to get from the uptight hardware cucklords that were his first replies. 😂",Negative
AMD,"Windows 10? Needs to be Win 11 my dude :) Also, up the psu to an 850w.",Neutral
AMD,I live like 2-2.5 hours from a microcenter and I'm very much considering stopping by without even being ready to start a build lmao,Neutral
AMD,I went out of my way to stop at a MC on my 16hr drive between ABQ and Iowa earlier this year. Got a 5090 for near MSRP back in March. 1hr is nothing 😂,Negative
AMD,Oh I’m definitely going. Im gonna need all the help I can get,Positive
AMD,"The microcenter “near” me is an hour drive. I don’t know Fry’s but if it’s like MC, I too would drive an hour just to look at cool stuff.   I 3D print, build raspberry pi stuff, solder old consoles and now have a gaming pc so basically every department of that story speaks to me",Positive
AMD,lol I mean to be fair he also could’ve spent 5 mins reading the million threads with this same exact question,Neutral
AMD,Says who? Some rich stupid corporate guy at Microsoft? Lmao  They said Windows 10 will be the last Windows we will ever need and no other windows would be made but we were deceived and they made Windows 11  Well imma stay true to what they said... Windows 10 will be the last windows i will ever need and when it all actually goes to shit i will just switch to Linux... probably by that time most of the stuff will be supported and working on Linux,Negative
AMD,Got my first build done with the help of micro center definitely do it they are super knowledgeable,Positive
AMD,I’m also open to any alternative parts because I really don’t know what I’m doing,Neutral

AMD,I don’t really get understand most of the specifics could you explain why you made the changes you did?,Negative
AMD,"Slightly better CPU for $7 more. Better air cooler for cheaper. Significantly better motherboard, the motherboard you selected was pretty bad. Better RAM that's better suited for AM5. Much better SSD for cheaper. Better case with in-built fans. Better PSU for cheaper. A good 1440p monitor instead of 1080p.",Positive
AMD,I don’t know much about motherboards what is a BIOS update and how do you update it?,Neutral
AMD,"You just download the BIOS file and copy it to a USB stick, and then give the motherboard the power supply and then press the BIOS flashback button. Here's the guide from MSI: https://www.msi.com/support/technical_details/MB_Flash_BIOS_Button",Neutral
AMD,So I assume I’d have to assemble everything install windows and stuff and then update the BIOS right?,Neutral
AMD,"No assemble everything, then update bios and then windows. Computer won't turn on without updating BIOS.",Neutral
AMD,Oh ok thank you,Positive
AMD,You're welcome.,Neutral
AMD,bite the bullet ; go am5 ; keep the 5600 as a spare cpu,Neutral
AMD,"put it this way, i run a 9070xt on a 5600 am4 and it works just fine .. it also will record high quality video and run a AAA game at 1440 ultra at the same time beautifully .. 'without' any frame gen enabled .. a 70ti im sure would be about the same as long as your system is set up well, 32g ram, enough psu, fresh windows install .. you can update the rest of the system at any time, id do it now if i thought it would 'make it better' but at this point, it games and video edits still really well ..",Positive
AMD,"Honestly, just go AM5 at this point.  Just keep in mind that you'll need to grab a whole new motherboard and RAM kit if you're looking to grab a 7000 or 9000-series CPU (AM5).  I just recently rebuilt my wife's computer. Went from ATX to mini-ITX. I also contemplated sticking to AM4 and only getting a new motherboard for the downsizing, but it made more sense to jump to AM5. She went from a 5600X to a 9600X and a whole new GPU. The jump in performance for less power and temperatures was great.",Neutral
AMD,I think more context is needed on what you'll be doing and if it's cpu demanding. since all those parts can still run fine on am4 its mostly if you still want that extra juice or dont want to take apart your build again when you upgrade.,Neutral
AMD,"It's not ideal, but you could just keep the r5-5600x system going for now with a new GPU.  Eventually ddr5 pricing should come down.  The other thing to do is to just buy the AM5 setup now and just deal with the extra cost.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm also on AM4, but at the rate things are going, I won't be going to AM5 till AM6 comes out.  5800XT does give you a little more speed and more cores which can help in some non gaming tasks.  As long as you evaluate your options and do what makes you happiest, there's no wrong choice.",Neutral
AMD,"i'm currently using a 5800x3d, bought it used as a part of a whole build where i needed some of the other parts for my other project, this was at the beggining of this year  i paid 900eur for:  CPU: 5800x3d   CPU cooler: BeQuiet Dark Rock Pro4   MBO: ASUS ROG STRIX B550-F GAMING   GPU: gigabyte 3070 8GB   RAM: 2x16GB DDR4@3200MHz   PSU: 1450W chieftec   Storage: 1TB Samsung evo NVMe   Case: some ugly LianLi  sold the GPU, my previously used 5600x, the dark rock cooler, and the case for 600eur total,   so in the end i'm down 300eur for a 5800x3d, 32GB of RAM, a 1450W PSU, 1TB of storage, and a full atx motherboard, which imo seems like a pretty solid deal, you might be able to find something similar if you take the time to find a good deal",Neutral
AMD,"It is only in retrospect that we can know when the ""perfect"" time was to build a pc.  Last year people began waiting for the new gpu's that were coming in 2025.  The gpu launches were a fiasco.  Gpu prices finally came down and then ram prices took off.  Who knows if a recession, plague, disasters will close plants, or China will invade Taiwan?  All we know is that things will change, we don't know the details, we only know change is coming.  If you can afford a build, and if you have a need to build a new pc, build a new pc.  Enjoy your new build!  Trying to time the perfect time to build a pc is like trying to time the stock market.  You won't know if the time was tight until after that time has passed.",Neutral
AMD,"If i were in your shoes, i would buy a new gpu and keep the rest of the system until the ram prices get better.",Neutral
AMD,"Can't use a 5600 on AM5, unless you mean to keep the old motherboard and RAM as well.",Neutral
AMD,"That makes no sense.   You'd have to rip the entire (new) machine apart if something happened to anything, in order to use the 5600X. Plus likely have to reinstall Windows.   And just having a ""spare"" am4 motherboard, cpu, and ram sitting around doing nothing seems silly.  Either build a small system around the 5600X or sell the parts.",Negative
AMD,"Even with all of the prices considered? The upgrade (especially right now) would be considerably expensive. Not sure if it’s worth it, given that an upgrade to a 5800XT may help he squeeze more out of the 5070ti",Negative
AMD,"I had the same mentality until I found out that Zen 6 AND Zen 7 will be coming to AM5, so I'll be upgrading from my 12700 to Zen 4 sooner rather than later.",Neutral
AMD,that was implied,Neutral
AMD,"have you ever heard of a backup???? its not an original idea i had this is a basic concept in pc building for troubleshooting   plus, the main idea is to get am5, so might as well keep what your already have",Negative
AMD,"I mean, if you're thinking of sticking to AM4, I would look into finding something like a 5600X3D or 5700X3D because that's where you'll see the biggest jump if you're gaming at 1080/1440.  I also just remembered how ridiculously expensive DDR5 RAM has become so I kinda want to take back what I said earlier. It's idiotic right now.",Neutral
AMD,I didn’t know this. So AM5 will be around for some time?,Neutral
AMD,"Realistically I'll limp onto AM5 after the next generation of CPUs come out, but that might be 2 years from now.  Fortunately my use case still fits in AM4.",Neutral
AMD,Nice! My bad.,Positive
AMD,"Doesn't work that way.  Why ""keep what you have"" when it's functionally useless for your system?  OP can't reasonably use the mb+cpu+ram in the new AM5 system if something goes wrong, so why keep it? There's also not enough left to have a full system on its own to run (he'd need a PSU and storage)   Those pieces aren't a ""backup"". They're just extra junk.   Selling them is by far the best option. They're probably worth $150-200.",Negative
AMD,"Getting one of those CPUs also seems overly expensive since they aren’t in production. I could do that, but was wondering what you thought of the 5800XT, which it seems like I can still get my hands on pretty easily.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, the ram i bought this Sunday has gone up ~116% since. It's ridiculous.",Negative
AMD,"Yes AM5 will get two more generations of processors, totalling four generations.",Neutral
AMD,AMD has already announced through 2028.,Neutral
AMD,"motherboard dies: what do you do? You put the am4 while you wait for the new one to come...   Sure you can sell it whenever you need money I never said it was a bad idea, its just that selling it immediately is only viable if OP needs money, and since he's buying an am5 system i think he can afford to get to the end of the month.",Neutral
AMD,"True. They're hard to find for a decent price.  I don't believe you'll be squeezing much more out of the GPU with a 5800XT as you'll still be more GPU dependent. The extra couple of cores and slightly higher clock speeds will likely not result in noticeably higher frame rates.  The extra cache on an X3D chips would actually be utilized at those resolutions and make more of an impact, but whether it's worth it is another story.",Neutral
AMD,"You might think that's a viable ""backup"", but 99% of people don't.  Having to completely disassemble the PC *twice* is unlikely to be anything but a huge PITA.   If he can ""afford to get.tl the end of the month"" I'm pretty sure he can get a new AM5 motherboard with less effort than rebuilding his PC twice.",Negative
AMD,"Ahh. Sounds like At that point if I can’t get my hands on a new chip, maybe I should just stick with my current one if the gains won’t be that significant. Unless I feel like the extra cores on the XT are worth the $170 it’s going for",Negative
AMD,"For $170 I wouldn't bother. Again, games generally rely heavily on the GPU alone, regardless of CPU. The difference between 6 cores and 8 won't change much, unless it's got v-cache (X3D).",Neutral
AMD,How about outside of gaming (sorry for all the questions haha),Neutral
AMD,"Depends on what you're doing. If you're just browsing the web, running a couple of programs etc, don't bother. If you're doing CPU intensive workloads then yeah - the more cores the better, but again it depends. Regardless, two extra cores is not going to be life changing.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah probably, unless you're ray tracing or something. See how it goes with the 5600X + 5070 before upgrading the 5600X",Neutral
AMD,"At 1080p the 5070 will hit 144 fps almost in every game, I have a 4070 and a 5700x and use a 3440x1440 ultra wide monitor and I get 100 fps in almost all games, and less demanding games I cap 144 fps",Positive
AMD,"5070 is stronger than a 3080, so that’s a big uplift in performance and you’ll likely get the extra fps you want  will you be bottlenecked noticeably? Probably yes. You’ll know you are if your GPU is not hitting near 100% load at an unlocked frame rate",Positive
AMD,BF6 is very cpu heavy and you are already getting about the most fps your cpu can deliver   https://www.techspot.com/photos/article/3043-battlefield-6-cpu-benchmark/#2025-10-15-image-3-png,Positive
AMD,"They ask about BF6, a 5600X isn’t doing 144 fps  in BF6 https://www.techspot.com/photos/article/3043-battlefield-6-cpu-benchmark/#2025-10-15-image-3-png",Negative
AMD,yeah that’s what i was concerned about. might just be time to sell the pc and build a new one since upgrading cpu would require a new motherboard and upgrading gpu would require a new power supply 😔,Negative
AMD,"Overall, looks fine to me. The motherboard should come with a recent enough BIOS for that CPU, but in case it doesn't you can still use BIOS flashback to update it.  I checked the SSD and apparently it supports both 2x Gen5 and 4x Gen4 PCI-E modes, so it should be fine. Just put it in the correct M.2 slot on the motherboard and you'll be good to go; only one of them supports 4x PCI-E 4.0. It'll work elsewhere, but not at the rated speeds.  EDIT: Personally I'd suggest getting 2x 16 GB of RAM as 32 GB is the modern recommendation, but if you'll be replacing the board to AM5 soon anyway I suppose it doesn't really matter for the time being (as you'd be replacing the RAM anyway at that point).",Positive
AMD,I'd grab a [TD500 for 90 cents more](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/product/gfn8TW/cooler-master-masterbox-td500-mesh-white-w-controller-atx-mid-tower-case-mcb-d500d-wgnn-s01) over the MSI case. It has a completely unobsctructed front and has support up top for a 360 radiator in case you go the AIO route down the road.,Neutral
AMD,Thank’s for your reply. Honestly I sincerely don’t think I’ll keep this configuration a whole year so that’s the reason for staying with 2x8gb in 2025,Positive
AMD,"Assuming this is for gaming I'd personally look at the 6-core AM5 CPUs and save a bit of money without losing a significant amount of gaming performance.  I'd try and get 2x16GB of decent (6000cl30,32 or 36) memory right away. That RAM is slow and you won't be upgrading it. RAM prices suck though, so it's not easy to get that within budget.  800 EUR for that build looks good.",Neutral
AMD,"Unless you can find it for cheap, there are plenty of cheaper alternatives to the H5 Flow. You should also try and get a B850 motherboard, if you're planning to upgrade later.",Neutral
AMD,"The NV3 often uses QLC flash, which has low durability and becomes noticeably slower after a few years. Get a better drive with TLC flash like the Kioxia Exceria Plus G3, WD Blue SN5000, TeamGroup G50, Patriot P400 Lite, or Klevv CRAS C910.",Neutral
AMD,"Thanks! I have chosen that CPU because it's available for quite cheap (around 150).  Agree about the RAM, unfortunately prices are really crazy right now, do you think the low quality RAM will bring a significant downgrade?",Positive
AMD,"Indeed the B850 costs more or less the same, is it better than the 850 plus?",Neutral
AMD,"At 150 EUR that's solid indeed.  > do you think the low quality RAM will bring a significant downgrade?  It'll be noticeable especially in 1% lows, but not the end of the world. There are quite some benchmarks on RAM with AM5 (though perhaps not with that specific CPU, it should translate pretty well from other AM5 CPUs).",Neutral
AMD,"The ""plus"" is mostly just a marketing ploy to pay slightly more. Unless you know exactly why you need the extra features it offers, it's a waste of money.",Negative
AMD,Always go for more ram so long as it's not insanely high $ more ram will help with caching.,Negative
AMD,"For music production it would be better to have more RAM, so at least 32GB would be recommended.",Neutral

AMD,try re-seating the card in its slot.,Neutral
AMD,"Have you run Memtest86 on your ram sticks? I had all sorts of random crashes and it turns out one of my RAM sticks was faulty, which Corsair swapped under warranty.",Negative
AMD,"It's a known bug in BF6 actually. I have the same thing in BF6 with a RTX 5070 Ti, so I really doubt it's something hardware/driver related. It mostly happens while alt-tabbing.",Negative
AMD,"No mention of a bios update. Certainly worth doing, could help with memory instability. Try running a memory test like memtest86 or the memory test in OCCT. OCCT is *much* faster and simpler to use, but memtest86 is more conclusive. Any memory errors are indicative of a problem.",Neutral
AMD,U should prolly list what u found and tried already. Have never seen this before,Neutral

AMD,"New rig isn’t a proven rig.   Also there’s practically a checklist:  - Disable PBO/any cpu overclocks - Set RAM to AMD recommended speed and latency (almost certainly slow by gaming ram standards but a good starting point) - Manually set the PCI link speed in the bios.  Try going down a gen if there are still issues. - Pull half the ram.  Test it.  Test the other half.  If only one half fails, test the individual sticks.",Neutral
AMD,"In Adrenalin, go to performance, tuning, enable custom under manual tuning and check your clock speed. Games were running at way too high of a clock speed for me and I had to lower the clock speed manually. For me, It was trying to hit 3GHz on a card that is supposed to be only OC’d to 2.4 out of the box.",Neutral
AMD,"your fastest way of checking (if possible) is to use the GPU on a second rig (a friend for example).  If it works there, then start troubleshooting, if not, then the GPU has issues and you shouldn't even waste your time with it, straight up RMA to replace it",Neutral
AMD,"My last video card upgrade didn't like my my PSU. It was a 750Watt, but it couldn't provide enough power on one of the rails and crashed the whole system.",Negative

AMD,"Do you have a spare rig/parts to test the card/other components?   If you do, try swap one at a time and see if you get the error.",Neutral
AMD,Try downgrading quite a bit through DDU uninstall first. ARC Raiders tells me to downgrade from version 35.x.y.z to 25.x.y.z because newer drivers are known to have problems.,Negative
AMD,"my friend bought this card recently and it turned out it was just a bad card sadly, not sure if you bought this from someone else or from a store but he exchanged it for another and had no more issues.   the psu just not liking it could be a thing as well which is weird af to happen",Negative

I still not sure why yet.)",Negative
AMD,"Is your ram and cpu 1000% stable? Any undervolting on the GPU? Or overclocking?  Edit: how are the GPU/ram/CPU/mb temps?  Looks to me like either one of those above is the culprit. Ram/CPU/GPU/temperature instability can cause dxgi errors, undervolting and overclocking too. Also if one of those components becomes too hot, it may cause errors. Check stability, temps, if any OC applied to ram/CPU/GPU remove them. As you said demanding games cause this issue so you probably should widen your search for the culprit. Hwinfo64 sensors help a lot.   One last thing: some m.2 brands put metal stickers on their m.2 drives. They don't care about possible shorts when the m.2 cooler pushes the sticker down. It is possible the m.2 drive, if it has a ""big sticker"" on it, might short something. Happened to me with a m.2 drive. Copper sticker shorted some part and I had the weirdest errors.",Neutral

You do it in Adrenaline, I am not 100% sure if you can straight up reduce boost or you have to increase voltage, but try something like -250mhz boost or +50mV more. I think that stock 9060XT should boost under 3000mhz or only slightly over, if you boost over 3200mhz, it is likely your gpu is running unstable clock and you need to reduce it.",Neutral
AMD,this is a ram issue,Negative
AMD,Did you install a new windows when you made the switch? I would recommend to always do that when doing hardware changes.  That error code can mean anything. Usually that the gpu or the driver crashed. I had it happen with my 780Ti before it died for real so maybe your card is DOA.

AMD,"Is this a brand new pc and anything can potential be causing the crashes, or have you had this pc before and it worked fine until you got the gpu? I am 90% sure the cause is instability, some component on your pc is running way higher specs than it should. I already wrote in another comment you should try to underclock or overvolt your gpu just in case it is factory overclocked way past its capabilities. For RAM you dont want to use memtest, you have to create bootable flashdrive, run it for like at least 12h, you cant use your pc in the meantime and in the end it may say everything is fine even when the ram is actually unstable. I dont like memtest, instead a good tool that can find instability within minutes is OCCT. Try to run the CPU + RAM test for one hour and see if it gives you no errors, if not then your cpu and ram are fine. It also has gpu test, 3D adaptive + vram, so you can try that also. I like to use Vulcan memtest from github for testing vram, it can find any instability within minutes for me.   If all these tests run without errors and the underclocking/overvolting doesnt help, then you probably have a software related issue, but that is a whole different can of worms, you can try reinstalling drivers with DDU, but i think it is very unlikely this is a software issue.",Negative
AMD,"EA is infamously known for it's ultra delayed bugfixes. They took a month to fix some of the super broken exploits, so the fact that this bug is STILL in the game somehow doesn't surprise me. But yeah, I have the exact same crash on my setup so.",Negative
AMD,Try running 3Dmark steel nomad and other benchmarks on loop for a while. If there is instability then the gpu will crash consistently. If other games and benchmarks are fine but crashes happen in BF6 then it's a game issue. Try limiting fps or reducing some settings and report the crashes to the developers..,Negative
AMD,wanted to add a bios update can fix all sorts of issues due to updates to microcode to the CPU. handful of other little tweaks that can be applied.   Though its recommended not to update the bios unless your having problems. Which you are having issues so won't hurt. When things are running fine don't worry with them.,Neutral
AMD,"this isnt a typical bf6 crash though that popup has very specific terms, did u try googling those things.  Did you install games on  different drives and see if that made any difference?",Neutral
AMD,"You're right, it seems there is a connection between GPU clocks and this error. At least that's what some people mention inside the thread. The confusing thing is that downclocking doesn't work for everyone, and GPU clocks really shouldn't cause that DX12 error. Did you have any success lowering your clocks yet? It might require tinkering and tweaking for some hours. If it doesn't work, then I'm afraid there's not much to do until EA gets their sh*t together mate",Negative
AMD,You can easily limit the max clock in Adrenalin. Do not undervolt the gpu but reduce the max frequency offset by around 200MHz and check stability. If it becomes stable then increase the offset until you experience instability.   Undervolting would make the gpu more unstable since you will be supplying less voltage at the higher frequencies which would definitely cause crashing.,Neutral
AMD,"Nah undervolting is different, that’s essentially the amount of power being sent to the card, but you’ll want to check clock speed as well and maybe even try underclocking by 100mhz or so as well if that still is an issue.",Neutral
AMD,"Good call by u/drkpie!  No, undervolting is not necessarily the same as underclocking. Undervolting reduces the voltage supplied to your GPU, which lowers the heat it generates. By doing so, that could potentially *boost* your GPU's performance slightly, because now your GPU is less likely to throttle. Normally that's great, but in this specific case it's probably the opposite of what you want, because it seems the game crashes when the GPU clocks get too high.  I had a very similar error in BF6. DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_HUNG ('The GPU will not respond to more commands'). I believe I fixed that by making a specific Game Profile for BF6 (and a separate one for EA FC26 too), with other tuning values.  My custom global tuning for my 9070 XT is Voltage Offset set to -80 mV, VRAM Memory Timing set to Fast Timing, VRAM Max Frequency set to 2700 Mhz and the Power Limit set to -30%. That works fine in most games, but not in BF6 and EA FC26. Perhaps an issue with EA or their anti cheat.  So the Game Profile I'm now using for BF6, is this:   For the GPU tuning **no more Voltage Offset**, but instead I use a **Max Frequency Offset of -125 Mhz**.   The VRAM Tuning unchanged from my global tuning, so **Fast Timing** and **2700 Mhz**.   For the Power Tuning I bumped the **Power Limit up slightly, to -25%**.  But those are obviously values for my 9070 XT. You'd probably need different values for your 9060 XT, but these might be a decent baseline.",Positive
AMD,BF6 is very sensitive to undervolting I would leave that at stock.,Neutral
AMD,"You could try downgrading the drivers to 25.9.1.  The new 25.11.1 drivers work fine for me on everything except BF6 and Arc Raiders. While I don't crash, some features such as recording don't work.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep, new PSU solved it. Biggest give away was the coil whine when I really taxed it.",Neutral
AMD,It’s a battlefield problem it’s not a user error. I would try different drivers. I was getting this crash on battlefield and I have an all AMD system. It only started happening after the latest drivers.,Negative
AMD,i would say you could ask a friend or someone to test the GPU out on their system and all but thats such a whole nother thing to do and get done lool,Neutral
AMD,"Don’t worry man. I got my stuff finally figured out and haven’t had issues since. IMO, it’s likely bios settings, XMP settings, something of the like.  Keep your head up.",Positive
AMD,ya legos is a bad analogy.  physically ya but theres a lot of logic and software behind everything so if ea did something shitty it wont matter how easy something is put together.  Also the nvidia 50 series has been having far worse problems driver wise if you looked it up,Negative
AMD,Everytime I played and alt tab to discord always cried i had adrenaline open and saw my usage peaking 99 quite often after I put that config file changed the cores and threads it only peaked at 60 and in the 30 -40 in the lobby give it a try it can send you the link to try it worth a shot and only takes 5 min also my cpu gpu are all default settings,Neutral
AMD,"Then I am 95% sure the culprit is too high unstable factory overclocking, I dont know what these manufacturers are smoking but 3200+ mhz boost is in no way guaranteed on every single piece of their gpu, it should boost to no more than 3000mhz out of the box and then the user has to decide if they want more. You are actually a 3rd person just this week that has crashing AMD 9060/9070 gpu and the cause is (most likely) unstable factory OC. I bet your gpu is made by Powercolor as well....",Negative
AMD,what's your driver version? bf6 and arc raider is only supported after 25.9.1 but it causes alot of crashes so update to 25.11.1,Negative
AMD,If it's a new i stall and it's still doing it i think you could try to narrow it down by overclocking the card a bit and seeing if it gets noticeably worse or if errors occur at the same rate. If the card has a hardware problem overclocking should cause it to crash more often. If it stays the same it can still be hardware but something more minor but most likely it would be software. If you have enough free space you could also set up a secondary partition on your boot drive and install a different windows version like win10 or a superlite modded win11 to see if maybe it's a windows issue.,Neutral
AMD,You have any OC applied?,Neutral
AMD,Yeah my case fans and everything ran just fine it was just a weird issue with the gpu but tbh I think I was using a 3070 at the time,Neutral
AMD,how about the drivers?  especially the .net files.,Neutral
AMD,Uh huh. Seems by your response you may not know what you’re talking about. A dxdiag doesn’t come back clean or dirty. Post a link to your dxdiag,Negative
AMD,"I can't quite remember if Windows would report it as corrupted, but I don't think it did.  You should also be able to turn off Window's ability to update your drivers for you. So if that is the issue, it can be corrected. I'd have to do some research to remember how.",Neutral
AMD,"Do you have a HDMI device hooked up to your system?  I have a C4 LG TV, it will send out a profiling handshake intermittently, which causes my whole system to stutter.   I don't even have the C4 LG TV ""on and used as a monitor""   It's on standby.  CEC devices that have quick start etc can cause an over ride on the GPU to suddenly allow a monitor to work.  This can take control of the processes normally used for gaming causing the priority to overload or dsync.",Neutral
AMD,"My card seems to be very unstable at it’s factory clocks, and apparently more people have this problem, so I can only imagine how an oc version behaves.. Definitely worth a try. If you want to see my settings, let me know. Good luck!",Negative
AMD,"some windows feature incompatible with amd cards had to disable it, when i switched to amd. it requires some regedit so you best google a step to step guide.",Negative
AMD,that was removed or integrated. They didn't want people messing with it so in typical 11 fashion they made it core part of something. There no disabling it. Running a reg script for it (There older back like 23h2 I think or maybe 22h2 just adds garbage to the registry) now.,Negative
AMD,your post doesnt make any sense if its only affecting newly installed games not previous ones,Negative
AMD,"I've had four video cards (Nvidia RTX 4090, Intel B580, AMD RX 9070 XT, and Nvidia RTX 5070 TI), two different processors (Intel Core i5-12600K and Intel Core i9-13900K), and two different memory kits (Team T-Force Vulkan Z DDR4-3600 CL18 and G.Skill Ripjaws V DDR4-4000 CL18, both separately and combined running at DDR4-3800 CL17) in this system, and guess which upgrade was the only one that caused issues with instability? Sure, it could be user error, or alternatively, you may be overlooking the issues in an attempt to justify your purchase, much like everyone else who stupidly associates their personal identity with the products of corporations (*""Look at me everyone, I joined 'Team Red'! Yay! Please validate my existence!""*).  Nvidia is a scummy company (as is AMD and Intel when given the opportunity to be), and the RTX 5000 series isn't particularly compelling, but they're still objectively the better video cards (being a well-rounded video card requires more than just decent gaming rasterisation performance). The only reasons (beyond being a Linux user) to consider the RX 9000 series video cards were availability and cost, both of which are less of a factor now than they were at the start of the year. If you enjoy your RX 9070 XT and it suits your needs, that's fantastic, but it seems like there could be some copium involved since you're so quick to go on the defensive and dismiss the concerns of others.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah I tried that. Did that and used an older driver, did that and used the current drivers. Neither changed anything. Tried under clocking, tried forcing bf6 into dx11, tried low settings, tried specific setting configs for the game that people said fixed it. Nothing worked so far",Negative
AMD,yeah ill definately be reseating my ram and gpu again,Neutral
AMD,good to know about memtest. was going to work on that tmr but now i think ill stick to occt lol. and i made sure to underclock my gpu as soon as i got home. currently dropped it by 50hz for now until i can test it more tmr,Positive
AMD,"Yeah I got the next couples days off to work on it all. Appreciate the input, bios update is def on the list",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah I've googled it, and it comes up on bf6 steam discussion, various reddit posts, and a few other sites along with YouTube videos all discussing the same issue. And no I haven't tried installing games on a different drive. I have two drives one being for windows and the other for games. You think it's a drive issue? The crash only happens with brand new games like bf6 and arc raiders. Never for other games which are also on the same drive",Neutral
AMD,"i havent played any bf6 tn, planning to tmr. ill let u know the results. the crashing is a weird one in that it can happen every hour, or go a whole day between crashes. so i wont really know for a couple days if its really affecting anything. and if other people got factory oc'd gpu's maybe they dont know it like i didnt and need to underclock much more than they assume. i was told to underclock only but like 50-100 but my card is 200 over default spec so id need to go further to \*actually\* underclock it. at least i think thats how that works lol",Negative
AMD,I'll take a look at that when I'm home. Got a long list of new tasks I hadn't seen online lol I'll reply to everyone with the results.,Neutral
AMD,"wow, kickass response. Ill try your numbers when i can and wiggle them around till i find the sweet spot if that does end up being my fix.",Positive
AMD,Yeye I set that back to stock and I'll be testing with general underclocking for a while to see if it'll affect anything.,Neutral
AMD,"I did try older drivers and the issue persisted, unfortunately.",Negative
AMD,"Weird, I'll have to keep an ear out for that. So far power doesn't *seem to be an issue",Neutral

AMD,not to mention im the only one ik who branched into amd lol,Neutral
AMD,Guess gpu's are just in a shit state rn lol I just wanted a solid upgrade to my 3060 but my 3060 never gave me any issue aside from not being very powerful with modern bloated ass games,Negative
AMD,its a sapphire pulse model. never heard of them before i got this version of the card for like $350. i hope its just the oc. thatd be such an easy fix.,Positive
AMD,i saw that and tried that. didnt work for me.,Negative
AMD,"so through the various other comments, it turns out ea is aware of this issue. my gpu is currently slightly underclocked but another user pointed out that my particular gpu is factory oc'd heavily so i would need to underclock it a pretty big chunk just to get it to stock specs already. gonna do testing on that and hope it works for me until ea gets their shit together.",Neutral
AMD,Not my own but apparently my specific card is factory oc'd which I will be lowering and testing over the next few days.,Neutral

AMD,In safe mode? I went back to a 1080ti from a 2070 getting weird errors. Had to DDU  twice for some reason eventually worked for me. Just a thought.,Neutral
AMD,Watch a detailed guide. Do this in the most extreme form in safe mode to rule it out because if it doesn't work then the next route is determining a fault with windows or the card or psu.,Neutral
AMD,well it sounds like its happening to games you recently installed so could be that.  Also what reason do you have windows and games on separate drives? Do you mean partitions on the same physical drive or different physical drives. Theyre SSD's im assuming as you didnt list what you have for storage  Also your post makes it sound like it affect all games but its just games you recently installed and you said you swapped to AMD what did you exactly meaan by that.  Did you buy a new prebuilt with AMD only or did you build it yourself,Neutral
AMD,"Great, let me know how it works out. Crossing my fingers. Exactly mate, I know what you mean 100%. I also had crashes every 5-10 minutes since the open beta. My issues began when I enabled Secure Boot on an existing Windows 11 installation, which was required to play the game. After doing that, my PC wouldn't boot properly and started crashing even during regular desktop usage. After resetting Secure Boot keys in the BIOS, I finally managed to get inside Windows again, but then the crashes began inside the game (like yours, but not DX12 related). Later on I learned from others that enabling Secure Boot *after* installing Windows causes severe file corruption, so my remedy was to format and re-install everything from scratch (with Secure Boot enabled from the start). I have never experienced so many issues before just because of a game....  Regarding your clock speeds, try lowering in increments until you (hopefully) hit a stable setting, no need to go after factory defaults (the game doesn't know those values).  Remember to update your BIOS; make sure you know how to do this, or ask someone for help if you are unsure (or teach yourself via YouTube)",Positive
AMD,If you have to underclock to get stable I'd just swap out the card. My sister in law just had to do the same thing with her 9070 XT. Crashed constantly with RDR2. Under clocking helped. Swapped out the card and it's been running great ever since without any underclocking required.  Also I wouldn't recommend an undervolt for anyone with stability issues. Less voltage typically equals less stability.,Neutral
AMD,"Since my comment from yesterday my BF6 crashed three times. Once with an error (different one than yours), twice the game just closed without warning. Apparently the game also suffers from a memory leak leading to crashes, so that doesn't help when trying to diagnose the problem...",Negative
AMD,"Then it's likely a setting in your BIOS, loose connection, or a hardware defect. Your friend recommended you to RMA right? Do consider it.  Sorry you have to experience this.",Negative
AMD,"if its a power issue the pc wont say power issue, you will experience weird unexplainable  symptoms",Negative
AMD,"It’s tough but the grass isn’t greener on the other side, I play bf6 with cousins and friends and they all have Nvidia cards and they get crashes too. I was having a smooth experience with all my games until the latest drivers and I have had my system for almost 6 months now",Negative
AMD,Well judging by other posts this seems to be an EA BF6 issue as opposed to anything else.,Neutral
AMD,"It most likely is caused by too agressive factory oc.I dont know why but nvidia is super afraid of proper oc, all the oc models have like +50 mhz on core, the most premium most expensive have maybe +100 or 120 n they definitely could have clocked to whole 50 series 200-300mhz higher and beat amd because all 50 series gpus can do between 300-500 extra overclock and full  +3000 on memory, everybody is saying that ""9070XT is as fast as 5070Ti"" when it is obviously not true, not only is 5070ti 5% faster in stock setting, it also has much better oc potential, so the actual difference in average fps is 10% more for 5070Ti plus it has basically double the fps with full path tracing that can actually pretty drastically change the whole gaming experience if done right. and on the other hand amd is overclocking way too much just to catch up to nvidia",Negative
AMD,No worries. Just impossible to tell specifics on potential driver issues without seeing it.,Neutral
AMD,Are any HDMI?,Neutral
AMD,That doesn't surprise me at all and explains the situation perfectly.,Neutral

I will add though, it's not affecting games recently downloaded. Only games that just came out. I can play Minecraft without issue with shaders and huge modpacks, Skyrim with huge modlists and graphics updates, any really any other games aside arc raiders and bf6 which are the newest games I've played.  Due to that I do wonder if it's just amd drivers. Amd hasn't dropped new drivers for like a month.",Neutral

AMD,"Yeah but there have been things people claimed worked to alleviate the issue so If I can't fix it, a bandaid will do for now",Neutral
AMD,That's what it looks like. The factory oc on my card is heavy apparently and likely needs reigned back in with a underclock.,Negative
AMD,"Okay just ran the test, it is the same one I done. In the notes of each tab says no problem. But if u want all the info I did save it. Not sure where to put it for viewing tho lol",Neutral
AMD,Well its not the AMD drivers because Ive been playing on drivers from October with Arc raiders and BF6 and had no issues.  What games have you recently downloaded  and worked then?  Also what psu do you have,Neutral
AMD,"Getting a lemon isn't exactly tied to a single brand. Nvidia, AMD, and Intel GPUs suffer from the same thing. You just got unlucky.",Negative
AMD,"So is your gpu stable now and you can game normally? If yes then this is all you need to do, if you would prefer to lower the boost permanently, you would probably need to flash bios from another 9060XT that has a more conservative boost (or adjust your current bios which i am not sure is possible). I have seen people return their gpu over this issue but i dont think you need to do that, it is likely that your manufacturer will provide an update bios soon, maybe it is available already, check you manufacturer's site or perhaps the Adrenaline has bios checking and updating capabilities, i am not sure, i havent had amd gpu since Vega 56 came out (and that one was only for mining monero).   It seems to me like this can really hurt brand's reputation if even 5-10% of their gpus keep crashing because of too agressive OC, most people have no idea about changing frequency or voltage and could never figure this out on their own (mainly because they are scared it can damage the gpu, it is actually interesting how many people still think pc components are fragile like newborns and one wrong look will make them break, I even told my friend that it is completely safe to increase his core boost and memory offset on his 5070ti which is known to have massive gains with full oc, like +15% on my particular piece which is essentially stock 5080 level of performance, but he still hasnt done it, which in my opinion it is a sin not overclock these heavily factory underclocked gpus and bring them back to he is too scared and says nonsence like ""i am happy with how it works right now"", oh well....",Neutral

AMD,Nah I did check that my GPU is set properly and not the integrated. I did think I could disable the integrated but that could go bad if my GPU shits the bed. Isn't realtek an audio thing? Windows device manager says it's up to date and there isn't a windows update ATM. Should I go find them myself?

AMD,Got lazy and just took a potato photo. VRAM temps are still chilly so I'm hoping I can beat my previous Steel Nomad score. I've been trying to get a concrete answer on the 9070XT on its clocks since I've read that some are limited but haven't been able to identify what is limited and what's not. I'm not overly bothered since my PC is quiet and the 4K frame rates are solid.,Neutral
AMD,Well it's one reason why I don't see the need to water cool my system down overall.  I generally never see 55°C on either the GPU or CPU during regular temperature days. I'm barely able to break 45°C running games or benchmarks in this weather.  I could run even cooler if I allowed my fans beyond 50% but I like the peace and quiet.  https://preview.redd.it/r40n0rwiig2g1.jpeg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=37db1e8be0d45b0d375102160ac9074242102aea,Negative

An A620m motherboard to pair with a 7800x3d is basically the equivalent of installing an V8 engine in a shopping cart. 4. A single tower cooler to go with a 7800x3d. It would probably work but the CPU is going to be toasty  5. They only list 80 plus on the power supply, not even bronze. The PSU is the last thing you want to cheap out on for a PC build because if a bad PSU dies it's going to take the rest of the system with it. 6. The infinity mirror front panel looks cool but the cooling for that case is ass because of the entire mirror taking up the entire front panel 7.

AMD,"The usual suspects: Shitty cpu cooler, fancy looking but thermally horrendous case, no description of what quality of PSU (definitely 80+ bronze at best), bottom bin office accountant level motherboard, and zero info about whether the DDR5 ram is high level or absolute garbage tier spec. Same goes for SSD, though that is less critical for gaming in most instances.  Well, there you have it. Market with the fancy components that drag attention, and skimp out massively on everything else. There is a crazy mismatch between the CPU and GPU vs everything else. Looks like they're using those components to upsell everything else, either to chase fat profit margins or to empty otherwise unsellable inventory.  (I'm also from DK, I know our retailers have a nice habit of skimping out on these components and charging a lot compared to what better components cost if you bought them independently).  This said, compared to your laptop this is a big step up still. If you're in any way comfortable getting individual components and building a PC yourself, I'd go through Pricerunner for each part and see if you can't get all the same items but at a top-tier quality instead of the bottom bin leftovers this retailer has crammed into the build they're trying to sell.  Looking through other retailers it's still a hard price to beat for equal components, usually you'd have to get closer to the 14.000 DKK range to get actually good quality components, but that's just how it is especially right now with the RAM and memory price crisis.",Negative
AMD,"Better to get your parts and just dint buy anything that doesn't specify the psu because it's the most Important part believe it or not, do your own build then lay somebkdy 50$ to assemble it, it going to cost you the same price but with higher quality parts",Neutral

AMD,"The specs aren't specific enough. Biggest red flags are the A620M motherboard and the ""750W 80Plus"" PSU.

AMD,"No. That A class motherboard is a fucking stupid pairing with an X3D chip. Also, the case has some of the worst airflow I've seen since the days of beige boxes, they don't mention the make and model of PSU, but the fact it only says 80Plus, and not gold/platinum etc makes me think it's a fucking fire hazard, and the CPU cooler is a piece of shit that absolutely will not cool that CPU.

AMD,"Really depends on the manufacturer. I’ve had a Skytech prebuilt for years that I scored during the mining crunch and the only things they seemed to cheap out on was the power supply. It was still an 80+ gold, but some brand I’d never heard of and didn’t trust it so I slapped in a Superflower 1000w platinum. The memory was teamgroup and could have had better timings but other than that it was all fine name brand stuff. Asus mobo, corsair aio, etc and it’s been problem free for a long time now. Has a 3070ti and I game at 4k so I’m not exactly going easy on it either haha.   In any case when you’re buying a prebuilt they almost never mention brands and exact specs because they source different parts from multiple brands and spec them slightly differently like different ram sticks in some of them due to moving large volume, discounts, supply chain stuff, etc. It’s a bit of a dice roll unless you see it in person at a store and can look at what parts are in there. That being said, are you really gonna see a real difference between an Asus and a PNY 5070, a set of Corsair or Teamgroup with slightly different timings. I’m gonna say almost certainly not. The only thing that’s likely to really bite you is the PSU as it can take down the whole system with it if it blows… I suppose AIO could too if it leaks but that seems pretty uncommon these days.",Neutral

AMD,It's best to know the exact details of the parts. MB is 620m which limits a lot. 80plus PSU could be a 80plus white.   Yes buy for a parts seller and choose every part you want and know and have them assemble it for you. At least here in my country it's better and much cheaper to buy from these companies than Corporate brands or most of the time even cheaper than buying each part yourself and building.,Neutral

AMD,Looks all right so far. There isn’t a motherboard specified but the only ones I’ve seen have problems are Asrocks which have been known to burn X3D CPUs.,Neutral
AMD,"It’s more than perfect, I have the same setup except I’m using a 9060xt 16gb and I’m playing all my games on 1440p high even ultra/max so you’ll be more than fine",Positive
AMD,"Shi\*t, my other guess was the Sapphire Nitro+ B850A WIFI 7, im deciding between these two.",Neutral
AMD,Do you also have the same power supply? Dont now the brand so im sceptical but on PCPartPicker really good reviews.,Neutral
AMD,"The Asrock video card is fine, just steer clear of them for the motherboard (you didn’t have one chosen in your parts list)",Neutral
AMD,I got the Corsair RM850e but the one you have selected should be more than okay since it’s still 850,Positive
AMD,"Ohh my bad i forgot, ASRock B850 LiveMixer WiFi or Sapphire Nitro+ B850A WIFI 7 are my choises or drop more money into the motherboard, i dont mind.",Negative
AMD,"Alright, will try, thanks for your help!",Positive
AMD,"Playing it on 6700xt and 32gb ram, not struggling. Same cpu. Most settings high, native. 100ish fps most of the time.   So if you go for upgrades, go for a better gpu and some more ram. 9060 16gb  sounds good.    Otherwise you need to jump to am5 and build a new system.",Positive
AMD,"Thank you sm for the advice man, I really wasn't expecting an answer so quickly lol  I'll be sure to look into getting some more ram and a new gpu for myself this Christmas :D",Positive
AMD,"Just saying, the RAM shouldn't have anything to do with your performance.   Saying ""should"", because if you're loading up the system with infinite internet tabs, then, yeah, you'll need more ram to compensate. Otherwise, no reason to pay to go up to 32.   Now's not the best time to buy RAM.",Negative
AMD,"Iv'e been seeing a lot online about the ram prices rising recently so I'm definitely holding fire on that for now.  What would you recommend though, just a new gpu maybe?",Neutral
AMD,"Just a new GPU, basically. Your GPU is like 6%+- better than my old 1080GTX.   The sad thing, tho, is that making the upgrade to the 9070xt, I didn't see the infinite improvement I used to see, when upgrading from one GPU to another in ye olde days of pre 2010. Don't expect to get 300 FPS on everything or something.  I did go from not being able to run Apex on even medium, at 144 FPS stable (maybe 90 FPS) at 1440p --- and now, I don't even need to think about the settings, 144fps stable no problem (still 1440p).   But there are games where I gained maybe 30-20 FPS or so, so nothing ground-breaking (like in Horizon Dawn), as it seems like a total system upgrade is in order (still using an i7-8700k, slightly worse than yours, I believe?)  So overall, that depends on your expectations. If you want, let's say, maybe 90FPS stable with high-medium setttings on that game? I believe a 9070xt or 5070ti would do the trick (at 1440p and less).   Anything other than that, you MAY need so start upgrading your whole system.  P.S: I named the current ""hottest GPUs"", because from my POV, I expect to hold on to my hardware for 10\~7 years, Still using my system from 2016, other than the GPU and RAM (I'm a tab whore, needed 32gb).   If you know what your needs are, you can just get a 3080 or something 2nd hand for much, MUCH cheaper, that'll last you a good while.",Neutral
AMD,"i use the sliver stand one, what GPU do you have",Neutral
AMD,power cable should always be under the gpu. i love the cable managment u did here. id get a cheap 5$ screw to height adjustable stand to go under the gpu,Positive
AMD,4080 super,Neutral
AMD,Thank you! I’ll look for that,Positive

AMD,pretty much exactly what I wanted tobuild before the Ram shortage,Neutral
AMD,"CPU is about 310€,  GPU about 620€,  RAM about 180€ (right now in the shortage that is),  Mobo about 160€,  SSD about 140€, Rest prob is a couple hundred more, thats a good build. Keep in mind that PSU wise you wont really have much upgrade headroom, but I dont know if that even matters if you buy a prebuilt in the first place",Positive
AMD,I’d go for a 850w power supply to get some headroom for power spikes and not having problems over the years  And if the ram is not cl30-32 i’d also check something possibly from gskill or xpg(just to keep the price in check)   But since there is a ram shortage just go for whatever reputable  brand is cheaper,Neutral
AMD,Yes you should reinstall drivers 👍,Neutral
AMD,Alright  ok thanks,Positive
AMD,"Check out our High Refresh build, at around 1250 USD: [https://pcmasterrace.org/builds](https://pcmasterrace.org/builds)  Maybe change the 750W for the 850 in our next build, and pick between either the 5070 there or the 9070XT you have.",Neutral
AMD,"Pricing is weird in Canada - The 5070 is 740 CAD and 9070xt is 840 CAD - for 100 CAD / 70 USD (14%) more I can get the 9070xt which offers 20-30% more performance. That build in canada is 1300usd, so 100usd for a better GPU, nicer case, and white aesthetic feels like a better deal. Maybe I'm missing something though..",Neutral
AMD,"Keep your current build and change the PSU for the 850 in our next build. Just click the build link on top of it, and then change country to Canada, and you'll get the cheapest of the ones in our list.",Neutral
AMD,"Nice. I’ll pair it with my $2,000 16Gb of ram.",Positive
AMD,Paid $479 back in February. Figured it would be a little cheaper than $449 by now,Neutral
AMD,got it for $399 at Micro Center a couple weeks ago...,Neutral
AMD,I think AMD cut the MSRP  Some retailers were already selling less than the old MRSP,Neutral
AMD,theres going to be a lot of CPUs in the market because no one has the money to build a PC because of ram pricing.  The only people winning is the people who have lower end AM5 cpus and want a cpu upgrade.,Neutral
AMD,CPUs are going to get cheaper and cheaper as there's no RAM around to put them in new systems.,Neutral
AMD,*Smells 3d cache in the air at a discount*  DADDY NEEDS HIS MEAT!!!!!,Neutral
AMD,I got mine at that price with a cooler on Newegg,Neutral
AMD,"can't wait for it to reach 250, then I'll replace my 7500f with it and call it quits on AM5 and sit it out until AM7",Positive
AMD,Thank you Microcenter bundle for getting me a $370 price on this,Positive
AMD,Usually cheaper in the country of microcenter lol,Neutral
AMD,330 USD for me on AE atm.,Neutral
AMD,"damn the same price as my jeans, not bad",Negative
AMD,"Honestly, that might be related. People aren't buying fast gaming CPUs anymore because they cannot get the RAM to pair it with, while big AI datacenters are buying EPYC or some highly specialized AI chips.",Negative
AMD,Yep. Im still on AM4 with 128gbs of ram. Looks like im not upgrading anytime soon,Negative
AMD,Lol,Neutral
AMD,Pepperridge Farm remembers when Intel bundled Rambus RAM kits with Pentium 4 Willamette CPUs in an attempt to drive sales because the Rambus RAM was incredibly expensive (something like double of standard DDR kits) and was required for the CPU.,Neutral
AMD,I've noticed the x3Ds hold their value pretty well.,Positive
AMD,"I remember getting a 7800x3d during the fall of 2023 for $339. A year later, the price jumped up to $449. 2020s have been so unpredictable with computer part prices. I miss the 2000s-2010s era so much when I would upgrade to last gen (one year old) for cheap second hand through Craigslist.",Negative
AMD,You might as well have gotten it at Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory while on a tour for 99% of the country.,Neutral
AMD,.....obligatory* not everyone has access to a microcenter.,Neutral
AMD,Nice.,Positive
AMD,Well the nice thing about the X3Ds is that RAM speed is less important.,Positive
AMD,"This, my brother wanted to get some RAM and now a kit I paid $40 for is now $160",Neutral
AMD,You could buy a car with that much ram,Neutral
AMD,*Looks at the 5800X3D on the used market*,Neutral
AMD,Yeah I sold my 7800x3d for $335 when I ordered my 9800X3D. Should have sold it for more lol,Neutral
AMD,But RAM size is not and never will be.,Neutral
AMD,I'm pretty sure running on a single 8GB stick to save money is going to have abysmal performance even with the extra cache. 50% hit to the bandwidth right there. And then performance will drop off even more with the page file hitting the SSD.  Years ago I came across an experiment where someone benchmarked DDR4-2133 JEDEC vs DDR4-3600 XMP for a 12900K. The average FPS difference was about 30%.,Negative
AMD,"I built a new rig last December, all the good stuff, 9800X3D, RX 7900 XTX, TeamGroup T-Create 32GB DDR5-6000 RAM and so on. The RAM cost me 90€ back then, now it goes for 280€... the current cheapest 32GB kit according to comparision sites here in Germany is a Corsair kit for 134€.  I also bought a Kingston Fury 64GB SO-DIMM DDR5-5600 kit in August when it was around its cheapest, for 155€. It was for a mini PC. Prices keep climbing, yesterday it was going for 370€, currently for 392€.  God was I lucky with my RAM purchases...",Positive
AMD,"You mean more like a downpayment for a 12 year auto loan because cars aren't cheap either.  Several months ago I looked at a barebone base model Toyota Camry at a dealership and it was about $28K. Back in 2017, my parents bought a base model Camry for about $15K.  Man, life is expensive.",Negative
AMD,Is this a good deal?,Positive
AMD,I'm hoping to see a 9070 XT for $550. I've been tempted to make the drive to microcenter for it at $580.,Positive
AMD,"Probably a niche use case, but I got one of these because it works on a low end PSU. I had a 6600XT and wanted a better GPU but couldn't be bothered replacing the old 450w power supply that came in the prebuilt I bought during COVID.",Neutral
AMD,"Correction , Asus Duel 9060 XT is on sale.",Neutral
AMD,Is this better than a 7800xt? Sorry I’ve been out of the scene for a while.,Negative
AMD,"Started seeing these prices locally making them affordable for the first time this year. Unfortunately, 9070 variants cost twice as much ...",Negative
AMD,Barely outperforms a 6700XT and costs more than it did. This is so pathetic,Negative
AMD,9060 xt msrp is $349. This is $10 off. Why is this even a post?,Negative
AMD,"It's the cheapest it has ever been, but just by $10.",Positive
AMD,"If it were euros and including taxes, kind of (in the expected range though). But it's us dollars, so depending on how much taxes you still have to pay, it seems not like an amazing discount.",Negative
AMD,Yeah it seems pretty solid. Most are around $360 by my local pricing.,Positive
AMD,"The sapphire pulse is 350 euro here now (363 I got it for 2 days ago, trying to get the difference back lmao).  Might be worth the price difference. The card itself is fantastic. Huge upgrade from my 1070ti",Positive
AMD,Yup!,Neutral
AMD,In Sweden I just bought 9070 XT for 7000 SEK. We got 25% VAT here so it roughly translates to $585. Felt like a good deal.,Positive
AMD,Best buy price matches microcenter I believe,Positive
AMD,I swore I saw one on Newegg a few days ago around tha price,Neutral
AMD,Just pull the trigger. You aren't going to see better deals than that Microcenter one. Prices are expected to go back up after Black Friday due to the RAM shortage. Stock for computer parts also depletes faster as you get closer to Black Friday.,Negative
AMD,$580 is really great for what you get,Positive
AMD,"you have 9070's riding around that price, after shunt mod it is essentially a 9070xt if it had below avg. silicon lottery",Neutral
AMD,How do you like the upgrade? I also have a 6600 XT and have considering the 9060 XT.,Neutral
AMD,"No, but it has support for FSR 4 if you want that feature.",Neutral
AMD,Nah it's closer to a 7700 XT/6800 with better ray tracing.,Neutral
AMD,">Barely outperforms a 6700XT and costs more than it did. This is so pathetic  Where do you get your false information from? 9060 XT 16GB is on average 30-35% faster than 6700 XT, for raster and +60% for RT, according to multiple publications.  [https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/rangliste.2487/](https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/rangliste.2487/)",Negative
AMD,I bought my 6700xt on the launch day :/,Neutral
AMD,so real theres basically no good reasonably priced upgrades you can do from a 6700XT this gen,Negative
AMD,If gpu prices go up from all the AI shit like ram is then could be the lowest it goes for a while if it's just FUD to sell more gpus than still pretty good.,Negative
AMD,You can get the 16GB models for 340€ in Germany.,Neutral
AMD,Only within 20ish miles of the microcenter store. Unless its online.,Neutral
AMD,"I have been running my XTX at stock voltages but EVC modded up to 750-800W on water since it came out and my 24/7 tune file that I load to this day is dated like May 2023, so it's not like it's damaging it. The 4/5nm node is pretty fucking tough, just like the 7nm node was. As long as you don't exceed stock max voltage on a GPU it is surprisingly difficult to hurt in my experience.",Neutral
AMD,"It was worth it for me. I play at 1440 and it means I can use some level of ray tracing in games like Cyberpunk, and Warzone is super smooth for me. Also I like to play around with local LLMs, so having the extra VRAM is helpful.   I'm just lazy and couldn't be bothered with the effort (and expense) of replacing my PSU, so this was a nice way to breathe some new life into my machine without spending a fortune.",Positive
AMD,"It's a superb GPU. I have one, thanks to FSR4 I can run Cyberpunk at Ultra Settings with Ultra Raytracing and still get above 60fps. In 1080p of course.   FSR4 really increases the value of this card.",Positive
AMD,its p much 1-1 a 7700 xt just with fsr4 and improved raytracing,Neutral
AMD,Techpowerup's DB has it at 15-20%.,Neutral
AMD,"In germany the regular price is 350 to 360€. Anything going for cheaper is discounted (see notebooksbilliger.de, mindfactory.de and amazon.de)",Neutral
AMD,The efficiency gains are nothing to scoff at either. 245w for the 7700xt to 160w for the 9060 xt 16gb.,Negative
AMD,TPU DB has it at 25%.   [https://imgur.com/a/z2AKrn7](https://imgur.com/a/z2AKrn7)  Cut the BS. It stinks from a mile away. Or get some glasses.,Neutral
AMD,"You answered the person asking if this was a good deal with ""if it was this price in euros with the tax included it would be"". To which I pointed out that you can get exactly those deals currently.  I have seen different models on sale for 339€, tax included.",Neutral
AMD,"My bad, I misunderstood. I thought you implied 339€ as the regular price.",Negative
AMD,"This post has been flaired as a rumor.   Rumors may end up being true, completely false or somewhere in the middle.  Please take all rumors and any information not from AMD or their partners with a grain of salt and degree of skepticism.",Negative
AMD,these names are going crazy lmao,Neutral
AMD,"If those GPU specs are true, then these are going to lose the iGPU race next generation. Between the strong showing from the new Adreno iGPUs and the upcoming B390 in Panther Lake, I don't think RDNA3.5 is the right move going forward.  Of course drivers and compatability will be a problem for Snapdragon, but being triple-channel is going to help it alleviate the bandwidth woes of any iGPU. Panther Lake's GPU is looking to be 40-60% faster than Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake, which were close to the 890M already. I don't think they'll be getting that much more out of the 890M unless there's a way to massively increae the bandwidth it has.  On the CPU side, it's fine. Zen5 is far from slow and will be perfectly acceptable for basically everybody. It's a shame to not see Zen6 on mobile given the improvements it's supposed to bring, but maybe that's something for the 500 series to come along with a UDNA iGPU.",Negative
AMD,Gorgon point used same GPU as strix point? What is even the difference here?,Neutral
AMD,Slightly disappointing that the NPU has the same architecture as the AI 300 series with slightly higher TOPS,Neutral
AMD,"AMD is the company that has the pieces of the puzzle (RDNA4, Ryzen Max+ 395), but will fail to execute either in availability, or in offerings. Meanwhile Apple is slaying it in the hardware department year after year... (they are miserable in software and pricing however).",Neutral
AMD,Stop recycling products... Stop castrating IGPUs too. That's ridiculous.,Neutral
AMD,curious to see if Gorgon point has the low tdp gains that Hawk Point had over Phoenix,Neutral
AMD,More CUs,Neutral
AMD,i have a hx 370 and i thought i would be missing out on more tbh,Neutral

AMD,"Different market, but I think Apple will be the one to chase on benchmarks in 2026.",Neutral
AMD,We can't afford the ram for the igpu's in the next few years anyway,Neutral
AMD,+100-200mhz,Neutral
AMD,"The difference will be the price, as AMD will market these rebranded SKUs as if they were brand new.",Neutral
AMD,Not only NPU but everything else too,Neutral
AMD,This is just a new revision of an existing design that can reach slightly higher clock speeds.,Neutral
AMD,"You're comparing a Giant with an underdog. Apple has a market cap, revenue and profit 10x of AMD's. They have almost an infinite resources in R&D compared to AMD to access the top talent in the industry. You can't expect similar or close competition if you understand the whole picture.",Neutral
AMD,"AMD makes a “new” product every two years just like their desktop cpu and GPU divisions.  The “mid cycle refresh” is “non tapeout improvements” which is usually firmware, clockspeeds, and potentially power saving algorithms.  Flexibility is built into the silicon.",Neutral
AMD,"Nope, identical gen on gen.",Neutral
AMD,I was an early-ish HX370 adopter (September 2024) so amd won’t have anything better-in-class until 27 months since I bought my laptop.,Neutral
AMD,Oh definitely. The M5 is already well clear of the competition and unless they fumble the M6 badly they're going to stay in front. Bigger M5 variants are going to be untouchable for the PC space save for either AMD or Intel pulling out another mega-APU.,Positive
AMD,Apple is in a different league performance- und price-wise than Strix Point / Gorgon Point. The competition to Apple is Strix Halo / Medusa Halo.,Neutral
AMD,"Most don't even consider Apple, no matter if they are twice as fast.",Neutral
AMD,"Ok, but AMD is focused on CPUs/GPUs, while for Apple it's only a part of their business. Apple drops the M5 range for 2025-2026, another important step forward, available today...  while AMD is rebadging **the same** 2yr old CPU (Zen 5) and 4yr old GPU tech (RDNA 3.5) for 2026. And we'll probably need to add +6 months for broad availability (from the moment of announcement).",Neutral
AMD,"Supposedly the m6 designs are getting big redesigns, plus the move to 2nm.  M5 was a massive improvement with essentially getting tensor cores.  They just updated macOS to support them this week.  Supposedly it’s a huge leap in AI workloads.",Positive
AMD,Not for the standard M4/M5 laptops. Strix halo competes with M4/M5 Pro and Max and even amd compared strix halo with M4 Pro.,Neutral
AMD,"+1, the memory bandwidth of the base M5 is similar to strix halo. Macs still have limited game selection so they can’t compete for a gaming system, but the performance is class leading and on the productivity side it’s a different story.",Neutral
AMD,"Macs lack game, but if you are looking to game a $1000 laptop with a 5060 is a better deal than anything else in a laptop.",Positive
AMD,"Honestly im into it as long as pricing is good, for 250 its a good budget card though id like to see it for less as a 9060xt 8gb can be had for 275atm. 220 would be amazing and would help bring people into gaming for a much cheaper price, theyd have access to fsr4 too. Itd drive down b580 pricing also. Rising tide lifts all boats situation",Positive
AMD,Actually impressive for the price,Positive
AMD,What is the best graphics card?,Neutral
AMD,5050 is a better card in my opinion,Positive
AMD,Bought a Sapphire 9060xt 16GB. I was not able to get the performance upgrade expected from my 1070GTX. I was getting 30% to 50% of the fps I had with the 1070. I troubleshoot and tried about everything. Memory uses appears to be capped ate 4GB. Don't know what I was missing with it.,Negative
AMD,"probably won't drive down b580 pricing, margins are already razor thin. Honestly nothing wrong with using 8gb vram cards if the price is right, only problem with these cards is that they're usually overpriced",Negative
AMD,No pricing on this one. It's OEM exclusive.,Neutral
AMD,Yup no bad GPUs just bad prices,Negative
AMD,I miss the value of the RX 480/580.,Neutral
AMD,RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell?,Neutral
AMD,An RX 480 4GB with a mining BIOS of course.,Neutral
AMD,How? This RX 9060 competes directly with RTX 5060 within the same or less price bracket.   Your comment seems like ragebait,Neutral
AMD,The 9060 will possibly only be $10 more than the 5050 if it goes on sale outside of OEMs. It’d be a horrible idea buying that GPU.,Neutral

AMD,You can't be serious...,Neutral
AMD,"Holy crap that's a lot of downvotes. Congrats, lol.",Neutral
AMD,Only if you are a braindead Nvidia fanboy. lol,Neutral
AMD,9060 non XT competes in performance and usually faster than 5060 and you're saying 5050 is better? HOW.,Neutral
AMD,🤡🤡🤡,Neutral
AMD,REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE,Neutral
AMD,I think you must be CPU bound or playing on low resolutions.,Neutral
AMD,I mean if they dont lower margins then they wont sell. Im not saying theyll make money but they have to sell yk,Negative
AMD,"I thought the 8GB VRAM cards were actually ok. It's the 16GB cards that are a bit overpriced.  The 9060XT for example the 16GB ones are $350-400. 8GB is $260-$320.   It's good, but IMO not $70-100 better than the 8GB cards, and if I was buying at the 16GB 9060XT/5060Ti level might as well stretch for the 5070/9070 which are significantly faster.",Negative
AMD,Ofc but in the off chance the do release it,Neutral
AMD,5060 is priced like the 9060 XT 8 GB and loses universally to it,Neutral
AMD,That’s why getting 5050 for less and same VRAM and DLSS make sense,Neutral
AMD,It will only go on sale second hand. This card will NOT be sold firsthand on diy builder markets.,Neutral
AMD,My CPU is a Ryzen 7 5800x. I didn't change any settings and tested a couple games.,Negative
AMD,I just bought the sapphire pulse 16gb for 363. Upgraded from a 1070ti lmao    What a difference to run games on ultra now with ray tracing,Positive
AMD,The price of ram going through the roof is likely to make any 16gb card stupidly overpriced at this point now anyway sadly,Negative
AMD,So you feel it is a better value card  Not a better card  It depends on the price I suppose but a cost per frame analysis is hard as it's only in prebuilts,Neutral
AMD,How is getting a slower card for more money makes sense? So what if it has DLSS. 9060 has FSR4.,Neutral
AMD,It’s a two generation old CPU. So yeah it kinda is the CPU. The upgrade from 5000 to 7000 is pretty big if you dont have s 5000x3D CPU,Neutral
AMD,"A 5800x will not bottleneck a 9060xt, the problem is somewhere else.",Negative
AMD,You can ignore what I say. The difference in gaming performance from 5000 to 7000 is pretty significant.,Neutral
AMD,"Will Zen 6 be the final generation for AM5? In that case, I will finally upgrade from a 5900x",Neutral
AMD,Yay buzzwords!,Neutral
AMD,"i was kinda dissapointed, they basically didnt give the smallest hint about next gen gaming GPUs  and Zen 6 also, they didnt tell anything basically",Negative
AMD,I want more raw performance i dont give a shit about ai man🤦🏽,Negative
AMD,"Heh, I mean what else do you expect? AI generation and ray tracing is clearly the way to go",Neutral
AMD,Link doesnt work,Neutral
AMD,Tensor cores…? On a Radeon GPU?  I think this kind of mistakes are not reasonable on specialized press.  What a POS.,Neutral
AMD,I would honestly be happy if AMD dumped all efforts to push ray tracing and focused on GPUs that ran more efficiently.,Positive
AMD,Zen7 is rumoured to be on am5 and it kind of makes sense considering timelines for ddr6 ram.,Neutral
AMD,Looking like Zen 7 will still use ddr5,Neutral
AMD,"There’s a rumour that Zen7 might come to AM5. It’s just a rumour but it indicates that AMD is still deciding.  I think part of it comes from Zen7 & DDR6 release dates and the uncertainty of DDR6 prices and spec at launch.  DDR5 launch spec were slower than DDR4 because of similar or just a little bitter speeds but loose timings. And DDR6 might come with a similar problem as well.  I’m totally in for Zen7 being released for both AM5 & AM6, not just to make AM5 last longer but to give consumers the option, especially that going AM6 will be expensive for early adopters making Zen7 adoption slow if it was AM6 exclusive.  As for AM6, I really really hope it comes with extra PCIe lanes, like 4-8 lanes, I would hope for 12-16 but it not realistic unless they limit those 12-16 lanes to high end chipsets only (the E series) and can target workstation/server grade motherboards too. Currently AM5 high end, server & workstation grade motherboards are boring because of this, and the only way to get more PCIe lanes is to jump to Threadripper which is a very big jump considering how much more expensive it became compared to first generation Threadripper.",Neutral
AMD,"Nice! Sitting on the 5900x myself, tempted a few times but reading about the 9000 burns and stuff - no thanks I'll keep this beast.",Positive
AMD,I think i'm getting on Zen 6 and was about to get a x870 board in advance but it looks like Zen 6 will have a new chipset and that's probably actually going to be impactful on this processor. I won't bank on Zen 7 being on AM5.,Neutral
AMD,Most likely.,Neutral
AMD,"Considering zen 6 is most likely coming in 2026 from their roadmaps, they probably are still only in the early stages of zen 7 (at least the desktop variants which while the core dies are the same or similar, the IO die is completely different). I'd wager they have an idea of which platform they would like to stay on, but it could change within the next year or so before they send tape outs to TSMC. That being said, I think they'll stick with AM5 for zen 7 while zen 8 (or whatever they end up calling the architecture) will be the switch to DDR6. DDR6 is supposedly arriving in 2027 which doesn't leave much time for a whole new platform to be developed for 2028/2029, even if AMD started in 2026.  That's also not including potential delays for the DDR6 spec.",Neutral
AMD,Seriously. Unless they magically show they can match what NVIDIA is doing its just that.,Negative
AMD,"Brute forcing everything doesn't make sense. There are areas where you want to use compressions, approximations etc. Ai can help with these. The important part is to use it where it makes sense.",Neutral
AMD,For developers who want to pay less to develop shitty games.  You can take AI frame generation and the performance hit of raytracing and shove it.,Negative
AMD,Thats funny because that's not what this sub was saying for the last 4 years. They were saying Ray Tracing isnt worth it and a dumb endevor shilled by NVIDIA.,Negative
AMD,AI generation so they name them after monsters? interesting,Neutral
AMD,"They use matrix cores, also the new hardware features were disclosed by AMD and Sony already in a joint video. They will now have hardware BVH traversal on RDNA4’s successor in the form of “radiance cores”. ML continues to improve with neural arrays. Plus there’s a new compression scheme to improve memory performance they are referring to as universal compression.",Neutral

AMD,Nvidia did not invent tensors.,Neutral
AMD,Matrix-cores.,Neutral
AMD,those will be over 3k cost and req between 500 to 800 watts.  fyi you can vm multi cards in 1 card. nvidia does the same.,Neutral
AMD,"There's a lot of options for keeping performance on DDR5 for a while.  They could implement some kind of consumer standard for MRDIMMs.  They could add another stack of V-Cache.  Heck, we might even see some improvements via 3D DRAM if that becomes a thing in the next year or two.",Positive
AMD,Might be they release a AM5+ with PCIe6 and more USB4. I also think AM6 will be when DDR6 is ready.,Neutral
AMD,And probably still not be able to get anywhere near the frequencies DDR5 supports,Neutral
AMD,"Which DDR generation it supports will be dependent on the IO-die, not the CCD.  AMD could make a Zen 2 chip with DDR5 support if they wanted to, or a Zen 5 chip with DDR4.",Neutral
AMD,A rumor from an unreliable source is not indication of anything.,Negative
AMD,"Why not, ddr6 won't come before 2029, zen7 is 2028 most likely",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, AI upscaling like FSR4 and dlss is one of the big actually useful use cases for AI that I encounter in my day to day. FSR4 is good enough that I'm happy to play with 50-60% resolution in most games which is an insane performance boost. And imho it looks better than the blur from cheap AA so you get even more free performance from not needing AA and the image looks better.  And apparently there's a bunch more stuff you can upscale with ai, I saw a demo where it upscaled indidual textures and my understanding is you can do similar things with shadows and lightmaps.  I feel like 5 years from now modern rendering is going to be some crazy black magic with AI upscaling all over the place that allows you to cheat and only have to render like 20% of the stuff you'd have to do with normal rendering.",Positive
AMD,"Thats valid, they just keep pushing ai this ai that, and i have yet to see any real benefit in my opinion.",Negative
AMD,Ty!,Neutral
AMD,"Doesn’t work for me neither. Had issues with a different link today as well, and I never really do. Maybe it’s a Reddit app issue on mobile 🤷‍♂️",Negative
AMD,Zen 6 already will have some memory controller changes as 2-DIMM motherboards got revisions earlier this year to be able to boot it.,Neutral
AMD,"I can see 9000-10000 mhz ram being a sweet spot for zen7, that would probably be enough of a performance increase two gens from now.",Positive
AMD,">I also think AM6 will be when DDR6 is ready.  I agree. That'd line up with how AMD's been doing things since the AM2 days.  >Might be they release a AM5+ with PCIe6 and more USB4  Given what they've been doing since Ryzen 3000 series, i think i'd be more likely that they do it as a chipset thing, a la 500 series chipsets supporting PCIe 4.0 on AM4. You could use Zen 5000 series chips on 300 series chipsets with the appropiate BIOS version, in some cases, you'd also lose support for older parts, and the newer CPU may become limited to the PCIe version of the Motherboard (3000 or newer CPUs being limited to PCIe 3.0 on 400 or older boards)   AM5 may go a simillar route, the upgrade path is one of the things that are attractive about AMD so I don't think they'll revise the socket until DDR6 is a thing, and they move onto AM6. Before Ryzen, there was some compatibility between regular AM2 and AM3 sockets/CPUs and the + versions, but it was a bit of a mess. I don't think AMD would want to go back to that.   The 800 and 600 series chipsets are confusing enough already. B850 supports PCIe 5 while B840 doesn't and B650E does   What i could see happening if Zen 7 comes out before DDR6: 900 Series chipset with PCIe 6 and more USB 4 lanes (, as long as the CPU supports it) still on the AM5 socket.",Neutral
AMD,That is a possibility yeah,Neutral
AMD,We'll see. A lot can happen,Neutral
AMD,"Sounds fine to me. Unless AMD is showing significant issues that are a cause of ram bandwidth in relation to their counterparts, I see no reason why they need to be using max ddr5 frequencies. If they're still getting the performance, saves everybody who builds a system money not having to buy the top specs stuff",Neutral
AMD,"AM5 can already get above [10,000 MT/s](https://valid.x86.fr/7z1sg6).",Neutral
AMD,What? Zen4 and 5 can already do it...,Neutral
AMD,"Yea no shit.  What makes Zen 7 an AM5 chip is the release date. DDR6 won't be ready until 2029. Zen 7 will be released before then, and AMD is not going to make another socket just to change it a year later",Negative
AMD,"If multiple sources leaked the same rumour, then there's some base to this rumour, again I already mentioned it in my previous reply that it's still a rumour, but indicates that AMD is still deciding Zen7 things.",Neutral
AMD,It's not just that.,Neutral
AMD,You're woefully misinformed if you think 6000Mt/s the highest DDR5 can go,Neutral
AMD,"Can you show me this rumor having more than one actual source.  So not just two places reporting based on the same rumor?    And even then, it's still not a sign that a rumor has any base.  Plenty of rumormongers play off each other's rumors for clout, even when there's no genuine source for the information.",Negative
AMD,"Maybe not, but that line of thinking still really bothers me. lol  It's wild how much people dont realize how easily manipulated they are if they think some 'rumor' is indication of something being true.    We desperately need critical thinking lessons in schools growing up.  And not just one, but new and refresher lessons in every couple grades at least.  It's a skill and it needs to be reinforced and practiced.",Negative
AMD,"You are the misinformed one, as they can do 8000 ram (or even more for apus).",Neutral
AMD,"There is critical thinking behind it, no worries. Otherwise I agree.",Neutral
AMD,"If you think 8000 is the most DDR5 can do  you have no idea what you're talking about  AMD hasn't been able to deliver competitive IO since before Bulldozer, haters gonna block because they're incapable of debate",Negative
AMD,"Wasn't talking about you, but the original poster who said that a 'rumor' is somehow proof that AMD is deliberating on it.",Neutral
AMD,"It's in the upper range, not counting extreme OC which is still done with zen4/5 apus. So however you put it, you are the one who has no idea what he is talking about. Also I know that you are just trolling so you are not worth my time.",Negative
AMD,Here I am stuck with a 7900 XT until next gen of GPUs,Neutral
AMD,"While still performant, RDNA 3 has maybe aged the worst as far as feature sets go lol. RDNA 2 being able to run fsr4 is impressive, and slightly less impressive, but more mindboggling is why it isn't supported on Navi 3X",Negative

AMD,"Just curious - is this sub dead?? Literally <10 upvotes on few hour posts, no comments... Did everyone move to some different sub or what?",Negative
AMD,"I have a 7900XTX as well but most of these comments saying you go ""team green next gen"" are a bit rediculous.  We dont even know how next generation GPUs look like.  Who knows if AMD will be offering what you want at all or if Nvidia is perhaps even skipping a year of gaming GPUs due to GDDR7 issues.  You should make your choice when we know what we have, not out of frustration of a problem that is due to architecture and was known even before FSR4 was released.",Negative
AMD,Finally,Neutral
AMD,"nVidia does the same lock for newer features only for newer cards, but they own like 80% of the market...  I don't know what AMD is thinking. They had spent so many years for the fine wine rep to go to the waste bin in a few months?",Negative
AMD,"I think that the 7000 series will get official FSR4 support, both will be locked out Redstone's advanced features in the future. 6000 series lack the AI accelerators so expecting FSR4 support for these series was simply doomed from the start. FSR4 will supported on 7000 series, I am 99% sure, most likely in the Q1 of 2026.",Neutral
AMD,"Bought a 7800xt a few months back, about just when 9000 released (7800xt used was less than half of a new 9070) , and now amd are telling me they are leaving it out of future features? The GPU that's equivalent to a RTX 40 series? Wtf?   Not quite understanding the terrible support given to last gen. I'll switch to team green for my next gpu if this really happens.",Negative
AMD,"Ahhh, the biggest PRO CONSUMER company in the GPU space limiting their newest technology exclusively to 9000 series gpus. Thanks AMD, as always a rolemodel for the industry, imagine if big bad leatherjacket monopoly Nvidia would be this nice and pro consumer!!! /s",Positive
AMD,"People are expecting different things from Redstone. This should the ML solutions and the only hardware capable of it is 9000+ in the initial version.  AMD already did the translation that allows the last gen and older cards to run ML solutions with some penalities. No one, in the right mind can think that a tecnology will together with the transaction layer and the first version.   First you need to do the feature right, after that you translate it to older cards. That is what they are doing with FSR4 to other cards.",Negative
AMD,"Fuck AMD at this point, bigger scum than Nvidia.",Negative
AMD,"I hope that RDNA 3 and maybe 2 gets support, otherwise my 9070XT will be the first and last AMD GPU that I buy.  I haven't returned it yet, just because on the Linux driver, there's no nonsense regarding all of the windows driver fuckery.",Negative
AMD,"With rdna 3 being barely capable of decent rt (and its missing the hardware for it), fair enough.   I personally wont sidegrade my xtx to a 9070xt and lose vram for it so i guess ill wait for what next gpus are there.

AMD,Wow this is just bullshit. I hardly came to a 7800xt in my country and it's already not getting new features.,Negative

AMD,"""stuck"". You're not suffering.",Negative
AMD,This is why I returned my xtx for a 9070xt,Neutral
AMD,"there has to be some cut-off point, it just happens to be RDNA3. When the new feature relies so much on AI, the lack of dedicated hardware just can't be helped by software.  You can say the same for RDNA1 or even Geforce 1000 had no RT as well.",Negative
AMD,"""RDNA3 has aged the worst as far as feature sets go"".  Huh? What, ""official"" FSR4 and RIS2? LoL.",Negative
AMD,"I would like to think ""Redstone"" technologies might only apply to RDNA4, but that work on porting basic FSR4 features to RDNA3 is still ongoing in the background.  It would be a shame if they didn't capture that portion of the market.",Neutral
AMD,"To be fair, there's no mention that it is only for RX9000 on this teaser.",Neutral
AMD,Its a slightly different story when it's been clearly demonstrated that RDNA3 can support these features and AMD is simply electing not to release them.,Negative
AMD,"Personally, I still don't care about upscalers (except as better forms of TAA, perhaps), but AMD did market RDNA3's ""AI-accelerators"", it seems only fair that their AI upscaler comes to RDNA3(.5) then. At least in some form.",Neutral
AMD,"Right.  It is honestly driving me crazy.  I wouldnt be annoyed by a few comments mentioning it, but a scan of this entire comment reply section is FILLED with people that fundamentally did not understand how far behind AMD was with AI features until RDNA4.   AMD was ALWAYS the raster and dollar-per-frame king as a means to compete with nvidia.  But as AI has proven itself to be the way forward, the sting of having bought in before AMD matured in that part was always going to come at some point.  But beyond that, I was hoping to find some comments detailing out what FSR4 Redstone could mean, and instead its just a wall of complaints that it - whatever *it* even is - isnt coming to their card (which in a way I do get, but cmon man.  enough is enough, lets talk about the actual feature set.  its going to be on this and future series of cards going forward).",Negative
AMD,"True but only partially imo  FSR4 clearly needs some work to adapt it to RDNA3 so while it can run I'm okay it's not here, they could atleast make a stamement saying if they will or will not release it though, not hard to do  Ray reconstruction though makes 0 sense, and using the argument ""AMD was behind"" also doesn't because afaik on Nvidia it's supported all the way back to the 20 series so the first ever RT cards, you aren't going to tell me that RDNA3 has less capable RT cores than the 20 series  If a 2060 can run it so can my 7900xt, let's be real they're gatekeeping it 100% for marketing reason not any technical ones, atleast fsr4 has a technical part to it",Negative

AMD,"Yeah, this is very funny. Fanboys hivemind changed its mind after latest situation with driver support",Neutral

AMD,"I don't know if I should even be happy about this news, not to mention upvoting this.",Negative
AMD,I just bought a 7900xtx last weekend. Regret nothing. I personally don't care about FSR but folks on here need to look at the bigger picture before they dump an entire company over speculation.    I dumped Nvidia after the 2000 series card review scandle. They basically threatened to blackball well established hardware reviewers if they didn't focus their review on RT performance instead of rasteizarion.     To me that's a whole different level of market manipulation evilness than simply not *anouncing* the development of new features for older cards. These kids are mad they didn't announce something they likely will anounce. It's like the fucking 6000 support things that blew up. It was all a rumer based off non-information.   I'm all for saying fuck the big companies but let's do so with facts and not rumors.,Negative
AMD,I wouldn't count on it but maybe who knows. Linux community will port it before AMD and it should work with both RDNA2/3,Neutral
AMD,"Sounds quite realistic. Although, I think fsr4 on 7000 might be even later, (Q2 of 2026)",Neutral
AMD,"It is because the 7000 series and before lack the built in AI accelerators that the 9000 series has (which supposedly is a massive improvement over the first generation).  The model that was leaked and that you can run on your 7800xt seems to be a less efficient method that essentially emulates what is happening natively on RDNA4 - but it is still better than FSR3, and will more than likely get official support announced later down the road.   The fact that we are getting a *core feature* for RDNA4 nearly a year after it launched for the hardware the architecture was literally designed to take advantage of should tell you enough as to why older cards are lagging behind in support for new features that those cards were never designed from the ground up to take advantage of.   It will come - AMD likely understands that it cannot afford to completely jettison support of prior generations.  But it is less of a priority given that the 9000 series seems to be their springboard to getting back into direct competition with nvidia.   Which, cmon now - they havent been for a few generations, especially after DLSS has proven itself to be the key winning feature over the pure raster performance of AMD.",Neutral
AMD,At least you’re still getting driver updates.  My 6800 is on its way to becoming a paper weight since it’s officially not getting any more game specific drivers,Neutral
AMD,/s for the “thanks” or mocking of those type of comments?,Positive
AMD,I am just starting to use Linux. Are the amd drivers easier to install and use than the nvidia ones? Multiple versions? Better support?,Positive
AMD,you bet fellow 9000 series enjoyer.  I am glad I picked up the series that AMD finally got right - and they realized that by letting everyone know that they aint supporting their old shit that was built from the ground up worse than ngreedia.,Positive
AMD,iGPUs struggle with anisotropic filtering. You’re going to be dead by the time iGPUs can handle raytracing well enough.,Negative
AMD,As greedy as Nvidia? Hah!   Someone didn't pay attention over the past decade.,Negative
AMD,no they will still complain because that is what people do.  I'm on a XTX and it matters not to me because I never use upscaling on a 1440 UW display.  If you are using a 4k display then maybe.,Negative
AMD,easier to complain on reddit.,Neutral
AMD,"As an RX 7900 XTX owner, I feel the same. Especially since we all know it's possible to have a decent upscaler, or even the 'original' one (FP8), through instruction emulation, like the open-source community did with Linux drivers. (For those who don't know, the FP8 model can also run on RDNA 3 pretty well. Before the INT8 model leaked, I was playing some titles on Nobara for that reason.)",Positive
AMD,"Or just realise neither are your friends and pick the best for you  For me the choice is clearly always AMD for now, for you it might be different",Neutral
AMD,"This is something that AMD really needed to not fuck up.  I am a 4090 owner, yet I really want AMD to succeed, competition is good for everyone regardless of the product you choose.  5000 series was a mess at launch, and the 12VHPW connector is still a lingering issue on Nvidia end, I did not upgrade to a 5090 100% because of that alone.  AMD had everything, absolutely EVERYTHING set by the clusterfuck of terrible drivers from the 5000 series release + 2 releases with the melting connector on nvidia side.  And they do this, after years of grinding getting rid of the bad drivers reputation and lack of good software stack.  Sent non that older GPUs to support branch, released FSR4 without support for their previous gen GPUs...  Nvidia did absolutely everything wrong and yet somehow AMD managed to fuck up the chance, and who knows if nvidia will make all of those mistakes again opening another window of opportunity for AMD to capitalize on it.  Fuck, even Intel eat market from AMD with their latest GPUs, and they are on their second gen dedicated GPUs release -.-""",Negative
AMD,Nvidia gatekeeps features every generation just about. They're not any better.,Negative
AMD,I’m already very fed up with my 7900XTX due to how much it crashes. Feels like I just burned this money  strongly leaning team green for my next card at this rate,Negative
AMD,"As someone who went through two melted cards, you can’t pay me to go team green until they fix that.  Features or not.",Negative
AMD,"fucking amen, they got cocky. Lisa needs a sit down on elephant dildo and rethink stuff",Negative
AMD,"Then move to team green and get drivers with gpu overhead, more expensive cards for the same performance & a connector that burn up because they are too ""proud"" to admit it was a mistanke to ever use that connector.   The thing is that amd is still a much smaller company, they unlike nvidia have to decide what their time is best spend on, and im sure they would love to add fsr4 support for the 6000 and 7000series of their gpu's, but as it is right now they are half a year behind with software support for their new 9000 series of gpu's.   We probably won't see them taking their time to improve on last gen gpu's before they are on tageted schedule with their current gen gpu's.",Negative
AMD,Same. Im an AMD fan but no reason not to go Green next round.   6000 and 7000 have been excellent for me since they dropped. I had a 6800XT early and 7900XTX since it launched and they've been great. I want the best of the best next round,Positive
AMD,"Same, been team red all my life. but that might change if they keep snuffing the 7900xtx",Neutral
AMD,Because Nvidia dont lock software improvements behind new SKUs of hardware ? Lol,Neutral
AMD,"I might do the same thing. My 6870 was decent in its day. My RX 580 is still hanging in on my backup PC. This 7900 XT should last a few more good years, before it goes in the backup PC.",Positive

AMD,I'm glad I got the opportunity to replace my 7900 XTX during the period where people were panic selling their GPUs in anticipation for the 50 series.,Positive
AMD,We don't need fsr. Native all the way.,Neutral
AMD,As an owner of a 6800 I’m livid they’re ending support for the 6000 series cards when plenty of them are still relevant.   I’m starting to save up for a new computer and I’m seriously thinking of going back to nvidia for my GPU. They still support their 2000 series cards!,Negative
AMD,Same if nvidia manages to fix its (bad) linux drivers,Negative
AMD,They are going to chalk it to hardware limitations but do you think it's true? It does seem amd are fucking over previous hem users way earlier than Nvidia would. Kinda scared the same will happen to the 9000 series once the next gen comes out,Negative
AMD,Just go blue ... but atm they dont have anything close to a 7900 xt. I can say i am really happy with my b580. It had some flaws in the beginning but for 250 € its still the best price to performance,Positive
AMD,Isn’t the 9000 series the first one where they’ve started taking AI upscaling seriously though? Surely the 9000 and future series will be able to run future FSR versions in the same way nvidia’s can with new DLSS versions.  I don’t think the 7000 series actually has the hardware to run FSR4 properly,Neutral
AMD,"Uhm, isn't DLSS limited to Nvidia gen too...",Neutral
AMD,"going team green meanwhile they abandon almost everything for older tech except the new gens, just because amd abandoned one thing? wild",Negative
AMD,"you still have FSR3 and any other upscalers that are implemented by developers, like TSR.  FSR4 uses hardware to accelerate it that RDNA3 simply does not have. I'm not sure why everyone is so upset about this.  The 7900 XTX is powerful enough to run things at native resolution if you turn off raytracing anyway.",Neutral
AMD,"Your next GPU could be one with FSR4, that argument never makes sense.",Neutral
AMD,"And what, ""team Green"" has been even more restrictive with their features.",Negative
AMD,"9000 series has the material improvements required for redstone. Team Green did the exact same with series 2000 and DLSS. If you switch over this it's just a tantrum, not a rational choice.",Neutral
AMD,"With AMDs lack of driver support for 6000 cards, my next GPU will also be an Nvidia card",Negative
AMD,This is a dumb take. There is literally missing hardware for you to have FSR4. Also yeah like Nvidia have consumer friendly practices ask how well DLSS4 works on DLSS3 cards. Oh wait... I said this as an Nvidia owner lol.,Negative
AMD,Cause team green is so good with backwards compatibility of its software?,Positive
AMD,You bought the wrong card to care about fake frames.,Negative
AMD,"Yes it's enough me, it's why I'm waiting for next generation. But In general I upgrade my GPU every 2-3 gens  with all the ray tracing (some mandatory), other games relying on upscaling for 60fps gameplay and  now features being only for new cards. I'm willing to upgrade next gen.   Im keeping my 5800x3d as long as possible no problems there. I also play at 3440x1440 and shoot for 120fps that's the sweet spot for me.",Positive
AMD,I'm literally dying rn,Neutral
AMD,"The fact AMD advertised the 7000 series as being cards with AI cores is a joke... What an absolute poor excuse for a GPU company when your competitor Nvidia that flexes AI on their cards can actually back it up. AMD just looks like a bunch of fools. When a 4 generation old RTX 2060 is smoking your $1,000 AMD flagship... lmao",Negative
AMD,If AMD were working on FSR4 for older gen cards then I would expect them to at least let people know that they are working on it. It's pretty bad marketing to let people get upset and move to Nvidia.,Negative
AMD,"Yeah ray regeneration isnt worth it on rdna 3 anyways, but theyre not even working on bringing fsr4 to rdna3, they shouldve just put rdna3 into maintenance too",Negative
AMD,I too like Fairy Tales.,Neutral
AMD,If they don't they will lose a lot of loyal customers that have been patient with team Red despite being behind the tech curve.,Negative
AMD,They are going to release a version for RDNA3.,Neutral
AMD,"No, same story",Neutral
AMD,The thing is that it will get ported to RDNA 3 eventually in some form. But nope. They won’t care. It’ll be all “how could they!!”,Negative
AMD,"Id like to know what part of the ""new features"" they were talking about when the branched rdna3 with rdna4 drivers",Neutral
AMD,"i like that they said earlier on that ML wasn't essential for Redstone, and yet they still choose to lock it behind this generation. I'm hoping this is just for now, and maybe they roll out FSR4 support for RDNA3 when they drop this feature set.",Neutral
AMD,"The int8 version is from amd and is meant for older hardware. It's still fsr4. There is a reason amd is working on it, they already done most of the hard work. But amd has a monetary interest in having fsr4 as an exclusive to their new architecture until their sales go way down. Also, there mights till be some bug fixing necessary and amd has quite limited resources despite all the money they earn.",Neutral
AMD,"It depends on AMD/Sony's work on PSSR 2.0 - a fork of FSR4. If Sony is footing the bill, they may have some control over whether the rest of RDNA3/3.5 gets backported FSR4 via WMMA INT8 (not DP4a, so RDNA2 is stuck to DP4a leaked code).  If AMD has to pay Sony 50% of the total development cost to bring it to the rest of RDNA3/3.5, AMD has to weigh that cost vs investment in future GPUs.",Neutral
AMD,Definitely will be official FSR4 support for RDNA3 at least.,Positive
AMD,When FSR 3 is the joke of the PC community they should of atleast did something... Instead of just giving their entire previous customer base the middle finger. Yeah AMD flip off your remaining 6% marketshare... Just shut down radeon at this point.... Your GPU side is a joke.,Negative
AMD,"Similar debate with me at the end of the last year 4070ti or 7900GRE.  While I do need and use some of the tech NV offers, I went for the better raster price/performance. But next upgrade the gaming and productivity technology NV offers me will be too much to resist.",Positive
AMD,Do you use FSR4 with RDNA3? I have a configuration very similar to yours (7900xtx + 7700x + 32gb ram) so is there a way to use it? Maybe you could tell me what thread/video you ran for the setup?,Neutral
AMD,Lol I went to /r/hardware to get the scoop on this announcement instead of coming here...to the AMD sub. That says a lot.,Neutral
AMD,Yeah I gave up posting it would take half a day for anything to get approved,Neutral
AMD,"""Hope is the last one to die""",Neutral
AMD,"> It is because the 7000 series and before lack the built in AI accelerators that the 9000 series has (which supposedly is a massive improvement over the first generation).  The model that was leaked and that you can run on your 7800xt seems to be a less efficient method that essentially emulates what is happening natively on RDNA4 - but it is still better than FSR3, and will more than likely get official support announced later down the road.  None of this is true at all. RDNA 3 does have AI accelerators, but it doesn't support FP8 format models which is what FSR4 officially uses. The leaked model is not being ""emulated,"" it is a native INT8 format model which RDNA 3 _does_ support.",Neutral
AMD,The 7000 series HAS ai accelerators.,Neutral
AMD,No need to install them. Chances are the distro you install already has them baked in.,Neutral
AMD,"overhead is so much higher though that its barely worth doing. You're basically picking between FSR3 quality, or FSR4 balanced to achieve the same frame rate and the image quality is only slightly better on FSR4 balanced IMO.",Negative
AMD,"I'm so mad I paid $1,000 for  a AMD GPU that became obsolete after 1 year. At least I know when I give Nvidia $1,000 that card will last me for awhile.  AMD had no business pricing this GPU for that much money. What a scummy business.   I also never realized how trash AMD cards really were compared to Nvidia. This FSR 4 was a wake up call for me.  Heads up to anyone who reads this don't trust the AMD fanboys on reddit they will mislead you Into buying their trash. Just get a Nvidia card.",Negative
AMD,It was not leaked It was released unofficially that way so that they don't have to provide support.,Negative
AMD,I don't know why you have a problem with that. It requires upgraded hardware to get full potential of new FSR. they may introduce elements to 7900 but still. It will not work as good as on 9000 series.,Negative
AMD,Neither are our friends but the fact of the matter is that Nvidia's older cards (RTX 2000 series and up) support more new features than Amd's older cards (RDNA 3 and 3.5).,Neutral
AMD,"I’ve got access to DLSS4 on my 3070 Ti, and so does the previous generation RTX 2000 series. True, we’re missing out on MFG, but at least we have access to the rest of the feature set.",Positive
AMD,"Well yes, but umm akshually no.  You can run ray reconstruction and DLSS 4 on even an RTX 20.  What you cannot run, is [frame generation ](https://youtu.be/1z7aco-y4RE), which fortunately fucking sucks, so yeah, nothing of value was lost lmao",Negative
AMD,"You realize Turing cards from 2018 are enjoying DLSS4 right now in hundreds of games, right? It's the best upscaler in the business. Oh and it can support ray reconstruction as well.   Meanwhile in 2019 AMD released the 5700XT with no DX12 ultimate support.",Positive
AMD,"**Or, to put it another way, AMD is now as bad as NVIDIA. It’s been a total shit show since Jack Hyoun took leadership.**",Negative
AMD,"I keep seeing this argument and its so stupid, gtx was locked out when dlss and rtx didnt matter at all, only became relevant years later. Rdna 3 gets locked out when upscaling is crucial for every game.  Sure 30 series doesnt get frame gen but they can still use fsr frame gen, no big loss there, and 40 series still has regular frame gen, with MFG not being that usefull",Negative
AMD,You can run DLSS upscaling on any RTX gpu that got released EVER. Nothing being gatekept. Framegen simply isn’t feasible on anything below the 4000 series. Fsr 4 is POSSIBLE on all gpus and we know that due to optiscaler and yet amd hardcore gatekeeps it 🤣,Negative
AMD,"I'd suggest seeking warranty, I do have one as well and never had any issue with it, both on Linux and Windows. By the way, did you have any other power hungry GPU before? Or do you use any custom PCI power cable?",Neutral
AMD,Mine had horrible crashes for the first year of ownership. I dont think I have had a single crash (that I couldn't explain as me messing with OC) in around 18 months now.   Sucks its still happening to some.,Negative
AMD,"probably should RMA, or check your RAM OC, etc. (I assume you DDU'd / reinstalled OS when you got the card)",Neutral
AMD,For me it is the lack of fsr 4 + multi monitor power draw.  I would have switched but now with baby so no time to play. But if nothing improves then will make switch to green also,Negative
AMD,I'm out of the loop for team green. What happenned?,Neutral
AMD,"I've been happy with my 6700XT but imo, AMD has accumulated too much lag over the last few years, even if they somehow catch up to nvidia next round, the problem now is adoption. DLSS is mostly retrocompatible to the first RTX gen, and has a 5+ years backlog of DLSS compatible games, while Redstone is practically starting from scratch, and will have a hard time to gain traction when it's exclusive to 9000 series which is a very small number of gamers.",Negative
AMD,"Try playing Native in Monster Hunter Wilds and enjoy 30 FPS.   Its a sad reality, but upscaling and fame gen is necessary in some games.",Negative
AMD,"7000 series (and 6000 but at a higher hit to performance) can run a leaked version of FSR4 right now.   I played around 60 hours of CP2077 with FSR4 on my 7900XTX and it ran amazing. It also looked significantly better then FSR3. I also play MH:Wilds with FSR4, that games anti-cheat isn't triggered by editing the .dll .",Positive
AMD,"[You can run FSR4 Int8 on RDNA3 right now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB0qmTCzrmI) AMD leaked it out months ago. It's slightly less quality than the normal FP8 version used in RDNA4 but it's still miles ahead of FSR 3.1. Now do you understand why people are upset? AMD 100% marketed RDNA3 as being an ""AI card"" and now they are dead silent on bringing competent upscaling to those cards.",Neutral
AMD,"Absolutely, I didn't buy a 7900XTX to use it with FSR, I got it for the raw performance. If a game runs shit natively on such hardware, then certainly the hardware isn't the issue.",Negative
AMD,"NVIDIA released DLSS4 on the 20 series, they are currently at 50",Neutral
AMD,"Released all versions of upscaling, up to and including DLSS 4, as well as DLSS RR, RTX HDR and few other features for all RTX cards, including those released 7 years ago?",Neutral
AMD,"If I have ""missing hardware"" then why can I run the leaked version of FSR4?",Negative
AMD,FSR4 upscaling is not fake frames. Thats frame gen. I try to pretty much never use frame gen with the exception of games that pretty much require it (looking at MH:Wilds). Upscaling is fine IMO.,Negative
AMD,"Despite what Userbenchmark thinks, AMD is often awful at marketing.   That new Gabencube being stuck on FSR3 would be a shame.",Negative
AMD,"Well we even have proof that they are working on an in8 frs4 version which only ever makes sense for older gen cards. They still haven't announced it. There might be technical reasons, their might be marketing reasons. The latter will only be true to get people to buy more rdna4 cards especially in the early days. In that case I would expect an announcement at latest mid next year.   However, it might also be a technical issue, like working fine 90% of the time, but requiring additional fine tuning and bug fixing so that they don't want to imvest the time and money in it.  If I had to guess, its mostly the former.",Neutral
AMD,FSR4? Has this been officially confirmed? I just keep seeing people parrot this without anything to back it up,Neutral
AMD,"They should make a statement then, even without a deadline but atleast confirm it  You can't expect people to not act like this when you don't give any reason to believe you will eventually do it",Neutral
AMD,"Fingers crossed. Im upgrading next gen, probably to Nvidia.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah it’s behind nvidia in software but cmon, just because something is better doesn’t mean it’s a joke lol. Amd still has great prices, my point was that if you bought amd for software you were kinda doing it to yourself, for people who don’t buy amd for software are still getting great products",Negative
AMD,"Watch Daniel Owens' tutorial on youtube.  It works well, I played Cyberpunk with it and its night and day compared to FSR2-3",Positive
AMD,"Is this valid only for gaming oriented distros like nobara or popOS? I have a pc with fedora KDE and I only have the mesa drivers on that. For nvidia the proprietary drivers are needed, but for amd? Is mesa fine or do I need other drivers that include the adrenaline suite?",Neutral
AMD,"Uhhh have you even looked at both?  From 4k, even fsr4 performance looks better (to me...) than fsr3 quality in everything I tried, the temporal stability is worth sacrificing babes on a bloody altar.",Positive
AMD,"No, it's always worthy to pick even fsr4 perf over fsr 3 quality. And framerate is better.",Positive
AMD,So there’s an improvement? We should get it.,Neutral
AMD,"FSR3 is unusable at any quality setting because it looks horrendous in motion. FSR4 mostly addresses that, so I'd gladly take a step down in internal resolution for the better temporal stability.",Neutral
AMD,"1.6ms fsr 4 fp8 (int8 is 1.3ms from my testing) vs 1ms xess on 7900xt 1440p a couple of months ago, so it mightve even improved since. A frame at 60fps takes 16.6ms to render. 0.6 ms is quite negligible, its really not very noticable compared to xess. Compared to fsr 3 (0.5ms) it is somewhat noticable at higher framerates. On my 4060m on a 1660p display dlss 4 transformer takes 2.5ms and no one is saying dlss 4 doesnt work well on a 4060m because of that.",Neutral
AMD,"""so much higher it's barely worth doing"".  Oh no, a game I got 180 fps on is now 173 fps. It's barely worth doing /s  Y'all need to get a grip.",Negative
AMD,"That really depends on the title, in most of the titles I played on Linux and now with the INT8 model on Windows, most of the time FSR3 looks like a shimmering mess even when applied at native resolution, and TAA or TAAU looks blurry, FSR4 is simply much more ""pleasant to the eye"".  The overhead is there, but you usually still get slightly better performance with FSR4 Quality even with the emulated FP8 than at native resolution, and I tested at 1440p, but for me it is not about performance but visual quality and stability.  I am talking about my own experience and tests, not what others write about, and I am a lazy guy and still went through the trouble of dual booting Nobara to use FSR4, although I have now settled on the INT8 version for convenience because I cannot leave Windows due to some work software.",Neutral
AMD,"All overhead negates if app in question is a RT app. What you said is true for raster only games.  Furthermore, this is via fp8->fp16->fp8 hefty tons of indirections path, if AMD wanted to do ( since they have the model and the code ) they could do a fp16 version just fine.",Neutral
AMD,This isn't true...many tech reviewers have it a couple notches above  performance/lookwise..I watched a quick review but it was essentially worth it  The 7900 cards having the best gains...the 6xxx series wasn't worth it though,Neutral
AMD,Only when it was first released  Overhead after the improvements was basically equivalent to XeSS,Neutral
AMD,FSR4 looks way better though,Positive
AMD,Obsolete is a big word lmao,Neutral
AMD,"I ran into a problem the moment I realized they already have a perfectly functional drop-in upscaler with much better visual quality and stability for older GPUs. They could easily release it as a “preview” feature or whatever. They did that with RDNA4 using the AMD GPU Profile Manager, which lets RDNA4 owners force FSR4 in older titles without official support under the statement that there would be no official assistance if problems appeared, and everyone with RDNA4 was still perfectly happy to use the tool.  In every game I’ve tested, the INT8 versions, and even the emulated FP8 versions, are absolutely worth using. And if someone prefers the older upscaler, nothing stops them from sticking with it. So yeah, the only reason they aren’t releasing it is because they don’t want to cannibalize RDNA4.",Neutral
AMD,"That's AMD engineering and long term planning at it's finest, I remember everyone joking and bashing out Turing cards for not being that good on raster even tho they costed an arm and a leg (i.e. paying for useless silicon), now it turns out they were paying for longevity, a true fine wine.",Positive
AMD,You're not really missing out on anything. Framegen has the paradoxical characteristic of being best where it is least needed and worst where it is most needed.,Negative
AMD,"You can because it possesses the required hardware. That's pretty much the issue with RDNA3, it doesn't have the  hardware to run this feature at a good framerate.",Neutral
AMD,"You can do the same on 7000- AMD cards too, problem is the performance.  Granted, AMD does marketing for their new cards, thus the focus on them. But I find it hilarious that people don't understand that.",Neutral
AMD,And everybody turned a blindeye and or praised them for it. Hardware unboxed praised the 5700XT as the VALUE CHAMPION.,Neutral
AMD,"Pascal had FSR for years now when they wouldn’t have had any upscaler at all without AMD early on, stop putting one of them in better light here both are not your friend they wanna sell you GPU‘s.",Negative
AMD,I didn't say AMD was better. I'm just saying it's a dumb reason to switch when both do the same thing.,Negative
AMD,"Gtx was locked out because of the change of the upscaling algorithm, just like the change in algorithm for rdna4. However, AMD is still trying to port a FSR 4 version to rdna3 ect, but it will take time as rdna 4 is the priority. Previous gen users just have to wait unfortunately just like other older gpu from other brands are waiting for certain features.   >Sure 30 series doesnt get frame gen but they can still use fsr frame gen, no big loss there  FSR 4 int8 version can be modded if you really want to use a better upscaler compared to fsr3 and xess. Sure it may work a little worse than the FP8 version but so does dlss 4 transformer older Nvidia cards.   Also I don't see any point in redstone being on older AMD gpus, for what?.. same way Ray reconstruction is useless on older Nvidia cards. People just want them for bragging rights, but never enable it.",Neutral
AMD,"So long as good upscaling is available I'm good.   Don't really care about any kind of frame gen. Like HUB says it's just smoothing and not at all equivalent to real frames. Out of everything I play Microsoft Flight Simulator is the only game I liked frame gen on, and I still enjoy the game even without it.",Positive
AMD,Even with an underclock and multiple driver updates and reinstalls it still freaks out and crashes especially in games like CS2.   I’m absolutely befuddled :( idk what it could be besides my motherboard maybe?   nice PFP btw,Negative
AMD,what's the multi monitor power draw like on nVidia's side?,Neutral
AMD,"Their new power connector doesn’t have load balancing across the wires available.  It did on the 3000 series, but they removed it on the 4000 and 5000 series - presumably for cost.  The result is that the cards can draw more power across a single wire than it is designed to handle and it melts.  Mostly prominent on the 90 series but can happen on 80 and I think I’ve seen it happen on 70 ti.    A lot of fanboys will blame the user and say it wasn’t seated properly or used the wrong cable, but this is incorrect - it’s an engineering design flaw.  There are aftermarket products like Ampinel that can shut the card off if it detects an imbalance or do some level of load balancing itself.    Here’s a good explanation of the flaw - https://youtu.be/kb5YzMoVQyw?si=NcAZnW0RK99izIyo",Neutral
AMD,The PCIe 5.0 12vhpwr connectors were prone to not fully connecting and melting.,Neutral
AMD,Oh if it runs that well they definitely need to release it then,Positive
AMD,Yeah RDNA 3 was a straight up scam. Then FSR 4 was the rug pull on their previous customers. Brilliant move AMD watch your market share tank even further from just 6%.  Nvidia is just standing here waiting for AMD customers to finally see the light.,Negative
AMD,"the performance is much worse though. you're skipping over that to push your narrative. clearly AMD has toyed with releasing an INT8 version hence why they created it.  The performance cost means you have to drop internal render resolution even lower to achieve the same performance as FSR3 so the benefit becomes minimalized.  Sure INT8 FSR4 is better than FSR3, but maybe they don't want users complaining how little the FPS gain is using FSR4 on RDNA3.",Negative
AMD,"FWIW, with the Steam Machine using RDNA3, I don't think AMD will be able to keep a blind eye to the success with the INT8 FSR4 leaks. I'm expecting an upscaler based on that prior work to drop soon-ish. Whether it will be called FSR4, who knows. But it will likely be an improved variant of the leaked FSR4 implementation, probably with better performance.",Neutral
AMD,"Yup, people only praise companies they have an emotional connection to. Pretty sure nvidia is bad but not everything they do is bad...",Negative
AMD,multi frame gen?,Neutral
AMD,It's not a conspiracy lmao. You can run a software approximation of FSR4. You lack the AI cores for true FSR4,Negative
AMD,You picked the wrong GPU to not play at your native resolution.,Negative
AMD,"The Gabecube will run on Linux, which means it will run the official FSR 4, and any Redstone feature with 0 problems. If you are on RDNA 3, you should definitely consider Linux.",Positive
AMD,AMD marketing chief definitely implied FSR4 for RDNA3 was in the works in an interview with Ancient gameplays Fabio Pisco.,Neutral
AMD,They're not doing anything in regards to FSR 4 for older cards and they never said so either. People literally just making it up on reddit saying its coming when its not coming.,Negative

AMD,"It should be valid for every distro, as the drivers are open source and baked into the system",Neutral
AMD,45% performance improvement with 4K performance mode on FSR4 yeah we should of got it.,Positive
AMD,That's one way of looking at it. The other way is that people will still complain that the improvement they get isn't the same as the 9000 series GPUs. People are just never happy.,Negative
AMD,"If i was alien, i could  understand.",Neutral
AMD,And when FSR5 gets released then people start saying that about FSR4 that it's barely usable if at all,Negative
AMD,If you're getting 180fps just skip fsr and play native.,Neutral
AMD,I’ve seen fsr 4 on my steam deck performance mode on cyberpunk truly makes it playable at high fidelity it’s crazy,Positive
AMD,Fsr int8? Since when has there been developments? I thought it was one time code leak.,Neutral
AMD,"It's no longer paradoxical once you realize it's not a performance increase. You need a certain input framerate for the frame smoothing to work well, Since FG itself doesn't increase performance it basically means the game has to perform fine already in cases where you want to use it, it's mainly good to max out very high refreshrate monitors so 240-540Hz OLEDs for example in games where the CPU limits wouldn't allow going that high anyways.",Neutral
AMD,Hard to have retrocompatibility when everything you make is a kneejerk reaction to whatever nvidia is doing. AMD has only played catch up ever since the first RTX generation.,Negative
AMD,I played around 60 hours of CP2077 with FSR4 on my XTX. Never had a single performance issue. It runs completely fine on it.,Positive
AMD,"DLSS 4 also runs worse on the RTX 30 and specially 20, so that doesn't excuse AMD.",Negative
AMD,"Back in 2019, I had a choice between the 5700 xt and 2060 super with reviewers recommending 5700 xt lmao. I went with nvidia.",Neutral
AMD,"still nothing worth upgrading to from my 5700 XT, so... ehh..",Negative
AMD,The 5700XT was great value when it released... because you could trade it for a way better LHR Nvidia card during the Ethereum days since it was so good at mining.,Positive
AMD,"Because Pascal didn't have Tensor cores for DLSS, does this really need to be said? Pascal cards got NIS at the driver level 4 months after FSR1 was released and would provide similar results to FSR except for the GUI artifacts if used at the driver level. Some games offer it as an option (CoD games still default to NIS in 2025) but it's rare.",Neutral
AMD,"But they don't. Do you need more examples of stuff that NVIDIA has backported to older cards?   RTX Voice brought to GTX cards. Ray tracing unlocked on GTX cards just to demonstrate how slow it would be and so people could stop complaining about how evil NVIDIA is for not letting them try it.  RTX cards have gotten ray reconstruction, DLSS transformer model, RTX HDR and probably some other stuff I'm not remembering.  NVIDIA Reflex goes all the way back to Maxwell (2014) vs AMD locking out Anti Lag 2 at RDNA1 (2019) and that was after people complained because Anti Lag+ was only supported on RDNA3 and got people banned for being a dll injection on the client side.  For anyone paying attention NVIDIA is always years ahead and does a better job of supporting their cards. Yes, they locked out frame generation from Ampere and then multi frame generation from Ada. Not that big of a deal when you consider how many other features they have brought to their older cards.   Also when they introduced Frame Gen for Ada it used Optical Flow Accelerators and they claimed Ampere wouldn't be fast enough for it to be a good experience. Now it uses Tensor cores but already Ampere and Turing are being overwhelmed from the heavier upscaling cost of Transformer model. They could probably backport it but it's not that big of a deal, the good upscaling is way more valuable.",Negative
AMD,"Unstable RAM (not VRAM) overclock can also cause GPU crash. So maybe troubleshoot that, too?",Negative
AMD,Thank you for the link and all the information!,Positive
AMD,"It’s more of a design flaw, though improper seating can exacerbate the issue by creating more resistance on wires that aren’t seated correctly.  That’s why the 3000 series didn’t have the issue.",Negative
AMD,"Yes, the performance is worse compared to fsr3 but still better than running at native and MUCH BETTER image quality compared to fsr3. Most of the time fsr4 performance mode looks better than fsr3 quality mode.",Positive
AMD,It's 1 tier difference and that's perfectly fine. FSR4 on RNDA3 in balanced mode will be the same speed as FSR3.1 quality while looking significantly better.,Positive
AMD,"They didn't do it, but tbf it fucking sucks so...",Negative
AMD,"Yup, VK3D-Proton 3.0 brings FSR4 support, and includes experimental support for RDNA 2/3. GabeCube being RDNA3 isn't really an issue. Linux, baby.  E: typo.",Positive
AMD,"I watched the interview, and he definitely did not. He just didn't want to give a definitive no and throw more fuel on the fire of previous gen owners that are already mad.",Negative
AMD,You shouldn't mod games that have anti-cheat software. They even tell you that could lead to being banned.,Negative
AMD,"BF6 is a multiplayer game with anticheat, anticheat can detect the dll. files. This method is mainly for singleplayer games. Try it with Cyberpunk for example",Neutral
AMD,"And to those people, I say cry me a river.",Negative
AMD,Yep. Look back at when FSR2 came out. Everyone said the same thing about FSR1. I play at 4k144 and they're all fine to me on quality mode. I can't take the difference vs native for any of them.,Neutral
AMD,"That's a stupid suggestion, when FSRAA exists.",Negative
AMD,"No, FP8 on RDNA3. Which worked way before int8 was leaked and improved to the point where it performs almost as fast as int8 but with better quality",Positive
AMD,"Yeah. It's an interesting feature and I think once they reduce the overhead further it'll be a no-brainer, but I stand by that you're not missing out on anything right now if you have a 3000. It just pushes you further into the realm of diminishing returns.  My monitors are both only 120hz (OLED and MiniLED) so I don't use it at all. But even when I had a 240hz screen I still didn't really find it useful. I'd take real 140 FPS or whatever over locking to 240 but losing out on a bit of responsiveness and having the psychological knowledge my real performance is lower.",Positive
AMD,"Yes, and? AMD had to do that at some point, better earlier than later.",Positive
AMD,"the FSR4 you used is not Redstone. I'm specifically talking about how this new feature could be missing on older hardware, just like frame gen is not available on Ampere.",Negative
AMD,"It is not the same Version of FSR4 that they run on RDNA4 tho, maybe they are testing INT8 FSR4 internally to release it at some point, they have to do all the QC again for INT8.

AMD,"The much better image quality *is the whole point to upscaling*.  The artifacts of FSR3 makes it pointless - who cares that you get 90fps on wukong when you all see is motion blur.    It verifiably looks worse than FSR4 using the leaked method at a lower resolution.  It is the same thing as when people talk about the PS5 Pro and they are like ""OH BUT ITS RENDERING AT 864P, WHICH IS WORSE THAN THE PS5"".   Yeah.  Because it fucking looks as good as the PS5 while running better due to that lower resolution.   That is why they did that.    That is the point of upscaling altogether.",Negative

I didn't have the chance to really test anything software-wise yet, but overall the quality and compact since is astonishing. I shortly tested a Acemagic in February and compared to that, the Edge AI is a dwarf and featherweight.   Really happy that they also implemented PD In @ 100W, so you can go with a more compact PD 3.0 charger. Shipping 4 different electric plugs for the power brick feels a bit wasteful though. The 2242 screw support being unfinished metal also feels a bit odd, because on my unit it looks like it rusted a bit, but nothing I feel worried about so far.  I used an old Win 10 image for a first functionality test. It was from a N150 mini PC test 2 months prior, and after installing the cpu drivers the fans stopped going overboard and USB-DP alt mode also started working as intended.

AMD,We can guess if these results are accurate then B580 should be near identical to this 9060 but with 50% more VRAM.,Neutral
AMD,"I don't entirely think so. This GPU is clocked 4.5% lower with 87.5% of the shaders.  That's 83.5% of the CU-mhz, or about 16-17% lower theoretical performance. The TDP is also almost exactly this much lower. If you power limit a 9060XT, it should still be a bit faster thanks to being a wider GPU.",Negative
AMD,"No, Steam machine GPU is more like a cut-down RX 7600.",Neutral
AMD,"Not quite. The Steam Machine has a 7600M, which is basically the RDNA3 version of this RDNA4 card.  However, there is a possibility that OEMs will make their own Steam Machines like how we now have the Legion Go S.

AMD,"I wish, Steam machine is more of a RX 7500 XT",Neutral
AMD,Why would a VRAM limit invalidate a small sample size?,Neutral
AMD,That is part of HUB's argument though. In situations where you're vram limited the RX card performs better due to the fact that it has a lot more PCIe bandwidth.,Positive

In canada, soon as they were available, i was getting the Sapphire Pure 9070xt for $830 CAD... Considering the typical taxation and everything, that's actually pretty solid for that card, which is more than what major retailers were paying in canada for the cards, but hey were listing them for far more, often into the $1000 range.      My only point of contention is that so many people seem to think, even insist, that retailers weren't gouging them out, that amd somehow was responsible for the ""above MSRP"" listings at these retailers, which is entirely bunk, consumers were buying anyways, sold out, typical supply and demand and boy did people make the retailers richer.",Neutral

AMD,in this case it might not be a bad idea on AMD's part. Lose some money now... to print money later.   Do you think Nvidia wasn't losing least a little money when they where sinking billions if not trillions of dollars over the years into AI? Look at them now that investment paid off in spades.   The real question is not is AMD going to eat the rising cost now. Its is AMD going to take a short term hit for long term profits.   I think we all know the answer.,Neutral
AMD,"Last time I checked Nvidia isn't planning on raising prices.  Also, when your MSRP was already a lie, raising a price is a good way to ensure nobody buys your GPUs when your whole gig is ""Nvidia -50 dollars"", except now it will be GPU that's objectively worse for the same money.  And believe it or not, best way to build marketshare is to eat the loss now for long term gain.  Tldr, AMD is giving people one extra reason to buy Nvidia, less than a month after doing that same thing with drivers.  Literally everyone I know who has AMD GPU after all this BS is swearing not to buy from them again for the next upgrade.",Negative
AMD,"And that does not excuse the stupidity of a $600 ""launch"" that came around with an immediate sell-out of cards that were re-listed at $660+ within hour or days.

AMD,Good to have your memory sorted out before the AI craze pushed price to stratosphere.,Neutral
AMD,"The GPUs as in the chip on those cards was maybe made in the past, but the whole card gets still assembled nowadays and the companies doing this will pay current market prices for the needed memory modules.",Neutral
AMD,"This product was selling out. There is no stack of old production to sell at an old production price. Not that a company would want to do that if possible anyway, they would want to raise to current market price; as long as they think the market can bear it.",Negative
AMD,There is absolutely no advantage for AMD to buy market share through lower margins. Nobody will buy an AMD card because more people bought them the year before.,Negative
AMD,"AI has absolutely not paid off in spades, shovels, tea spoons, or any volume.  The ouroboros of funding has inflated stock prices benefiting a handful of people, but the industry is still hundreds of billions of dollars in the red.",Negative
AMD,"There's nothing for AMD to invest into other than ""gamer's good will"". Nvidia has their technologies, while AMD makes consoles but somehow still behind in gaming. I hope collaboration with Sony about VRAM compression will help.",Negative
AMD,"There is no logic behind your argument at all. RAM prices have literally increased by almost 100% in the space of a month, do you honestly think Nvidia will not respond with price increases? It's not a matter of if, it's actually a matter of when.",Negative
AMD,"Last time you CHECKED, nvidia hasn’t ANNOUNCED they’ll have a price increase. Jensen needs a new jacket, and a second for his buddy Daddy Don. You can trust those prices are going up, there just isn’t a publicly facing blunt announcement yet.  Saw the writing on the wall and amassed the components for a new build back in Feb capping it off with a $600 9070xt on launch day.  Just pulled the 64gb ram kit I installed, it’s literally more than double what I paid for it. No company is going to subsidize their cost on a component doubling, on behalf of their customers.

AMD,on the other hand massively scaling up production could harm the ram manufacturers when demand suddenly falls. They are playing it safe instead of being extra greedy like nvidia selling copious amounts of 30 series gpus and then sitting on mountains of inventory after mining bubble popped. Like nvidia had to delay new products to sell off old stock. Nowadays the used market is flooded with cheap yet great 30 series gpus making the 40/50 series look bad price wise,Negative

AMD,"There will already be branching inside the code of the driver. This has been the case already, to various degrees, for years. It's not new.  It's just whether AMD wants to formally spread those branches out on a file / compilation level and distribute different packages. And then publicly whether they commit to updating all branches of code or only some.  For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch. Of course, we have very little outside insight into the exact spread of these cases that AMD wants to pay their engineers to work on.",Neutral

I'd give this a quick read: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-update-and-see-what-graphics-driver-you-have-on-linux-and-steamos/  Pretty much the default is that you will be using the Mesa driver collection and they were last updated yesterday.  The fixes there do not correlate with the ones in this thread (I think).  As long as you are on a ""cutting edge"" type distro then you can expect that update in the next few days/weeks.  If you are on a ""stable"" distro that doesn't update often, you may be waiting a realllly long time.",Neutral

AMD,"Didn't test long enough to see if it crashes as I reverted back to old driver when I noticed my gpu was permanently at 100% load which it never was before on old driver, doesn't feel like it's supposed to do that with a 9800x3d & 9070xt + 32gb ram, It's moving between 70-95% usage on old driver",Negative
AMD,Either launch with curseforge or rollback,Neutral
AMD,"Damn, didn’t work for me last driver either. I can get FSR4 to work in other games just not BF6",Negative
AMD,"Even the rollback doesn't fix it for me now. It being related to the combination of iGPU and GPU makes sense though. Sadly I actively use the iGPU, so thats not an option for me.",Negative
AMD,"Possible I had not any freezing till 9.1 and rollng back to 8.1 solved the problem.  Yet, I don't use any rare hardware. The rig is formed of most common brands and models. So there is something wrong with the driver.",Negative
AMD,You 100 procent sure on this?,Neutral
AMD,I went back to 25.3 official gigabyte latest driver for 9070XT OC gaming and 2 days no crashes for now. Also changed HDMI for DP cable  I will also change in BIOS and completely disable integrated GPU in BIOS,Positive
AMD,"I had auto update on (my mistake), so it did install over the previous driver. I've downgraded for now and it seems to be working just fine.  But no, after uninstalling from control panel I booted into safe mod and used DDU.   Then I downloaded the newest installer from the website. Restarting where needed during this process.   Didn't matter how I tried to access the software. Wasn't active in the system tray, not there in task manager.   Right click on desktop and open from there, click the exe, or go into a game and try Alt R. Didn't open with any of these methods.",Neutral
AMD,Driver with -s letter after black screen and reboot PC tells me that this driver isn't for my graphic card🤡,Negative
AMD,Does fsr 4 work on 25.9.1? I thought the only driver that works without having to change any files and risk a ban online is 23. 9.1?,Neutral
AMD,"I had to rollback to driver 25.9.1, start up Star Citizen, switch the renderer to Vulkan, exit game, start SC again to verify it's working with Vulkan, then reinstall the latest driver again. Now it works, just don't switch it back to DirectX. No idea who dropped the ball on this one but Easy-Anticheat sure doesn't like the atidxx64.dll.",Neutral
AMD,I'm not sure. However when I install the driver it states that I cannot use adrenaline and gives me a link to the newest driver. Wondering if there is an earlier version of adrenaline I need to install.,Neutral
AMD,What do you mean extension update??? Do you mean lg firmware update or something Ina  windows update? Where do I find this?,Neutral
AMD,They do not.,Neutral
AMD,"Well, I used the system before the latest updates normally, for maybe half a year. Installed every update without DDU. I wanted to triple boot, formated the drive, left windows to install stock updates and drivers, went to install chipset and GPU driver and voila, every wakeup, just before I could type the pin, kernel panic and shutdown. DDU, just the driver, installed again, black screen. Went into DDU again, wanted to see if I missed anything and without reading, uninstalled everything AMD related, went into windows, installed chipset drivers from vendors site (ASUS) and then the latest GPU drivers, and havent had issues. I have a monitor connected via DP and a TV via HDMI.",Neutral
AMD,Dont buy an adapter. Most of them are trash and dont put out the advertised resolution and refresh rate. Not to mention most of them dont support vrr or HDR.,Negative
AMD,The one linked in the release notes is combined. (in the sense that it's two drivers in one executable) (And 1.6GB)  .....amd.com/drivers/whql-amd-software-adrenalin-edition-25.11.1-win11-nov-combined.exe,Neutral
AMD,"AND is taking away one additional driver feature per day, you say?",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, I’m talking about 25.10.2 (posted the other day here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/s/nNunS1QlFX ). If you go to AMD download page and select “GPU” you get a file that has a different dimension from the one you download if you choose “CPU”. If you do the following steps 1) DDU (or AMD CleanUp Utility), 2) install CPU drivers => GPU not recognized or with a generic driver. If the you install the GPU driver you get the GPU correctly recognized and a yellow esclamation mark on the integrated. To have both VGAs working at the same time I have to download the AMD Auto Detect package (the file name ends with “minimal_install), but Adrenalin App does not open.",Neutral
AMD,Thank you for explaining it before the rage baiters go nuts.,Neutral
AMD,I've been following this one pretty closely. Unfortunately the fix *just* missed 25.11.1 release cycle; we hope to get this out in the next one.,Negative
AMD,"I have a 7900XTX and have this issue at times. It normally clears quickly on its own, but seeing pink pixels on the screen worried me that I had an issue with the actual hardware",Negative
AMD,"I totally understand. if you're running with an affected display config, you should be fine on 25.9.1 or the 25.10.1 preview driver for BF6. We'll get this out as soon as we can.",Neutral
AMD,"Appreciate you reaching out with this - that's an interesting data point to consider.  In this case, the quirky behaviour with HDMI 2.1 + FRL was attributed to a change made in the display stack, I don't think it explicitly involves display stream compression to repro, just high enough display bandwidth (though I could be mistaken)",Positive
AMD,"Interesting. I've been experiencing random BSODs on my PC too on a fresh Win11 install too, I was also suspecting it was something to do with auto HDR toggle but I didn't know for sure.  I'm running 180hz 1440 LG panel but I don't recall if it's using hdmi or DP. I've also never experienced BSODs until the last week or two, since i did a fresh install and I've had the same monitors/PCs for a long time.",Neutral
AMD,Don't apologise - this one is worth getting upset over. Hope it's fixed for you all very soon.,Negative
AMD,Was yours the DisplayPort config or HDMI? I may have a fix for this ready if you're available test,Neutral
AMD,Can you provide me some context? Are there any posts detailing the issue either here or at the chromium project side?,Neutral
AMD,Already launched in COD 7,Neutral
AMD,"Im currently using dp 1.4 on my 7900 gre.  My monitor has 2.1 hdmi, so you’re saying i shoulf switch to hdmi?",Neutral
AMD,Some of us are using DP 2.1 though. DP 1.4 is a thing of the past.,Neutral
AMD,Are you sure? The steam machine has HDMI 2.0 and DP 1.4 listed in the specifications,Neutral
AMD,"Ah ok, that definitely makes sense if you're using a TV. Hope they straighten it out for you soon.",Neutral
AMD,What I did is get the 25.8.1 drivers shut off the fluid motion frames and in Windows set bf6 to run full power on your graphics card. Try some of those things and see if that helps you.,Neutral
AMD,"I tried to reinstall the chipset drivers, the same error, tried to install the drivers from gigabyte site the second screen worked but uninstalled adrenaline and it ran the auto update that disabled the secondary screen and the issue of no adrenaline opening came back, going back to older version, thanks AMD",Neutral
AMD,With the compiled leaked DLL you can use it on RDNA3 as well.,Neutral
AMD,"Wait until December, there's the 5th anniversary and they'll supposedly drop something new.",Neutral
AMD,For me playing it with path tracing on eventually the game crashes. Had no issues playing with ray tracing: psycho though.,Negative
AMD,Amen to that. Not a single crash since the game released on CachyOS. (9070 XT),Positive
AMD,Thank you! Exciting keen to see what it’s like,Positive
AMD,"It has nothing to do with the lack of vulkan support, even when fsr4 comes to vulkan, the game still needs ray regeneration implementation from the devs, you cant use optiscaler through dlss inputs, like you probably will be able to in fx alan wake 2",Negative
AMD,I suppose is going to be fixed as soon as Amd Redstone go out. Basically is going to add every tecnology that Path tracing needs to work. Off course the devs would have to implement them in the game too,Neutral
AMD,"The issue is if you try to use path tracing. Which to be fair, you probably shouldn't unless the miracle of them getting Virtuous to implement Ray Regeneration in Cyberpunk happens.",Negative
AMD,yes i tried it ... maybe it is because of the 7800X3D ... i really dont know... i will wait for the next patch ... should come tomorrow 18.11. ... but i have read so many threads and i am not the only one...,Neutral
AMD,Hmm fair. For me on 9070XT if I had raytracing enabled it would crash most regularly on loading back to the menu after extraction which was annoying but at least not game destroying lol. But yeah annoying enough that I turned RT off entirely.   I hope this means I can turn it back on because the game runs well enough for it.,Negative
AMD,"My last two processors are ryzen amd, my last three video cards are amd radeon and next one will be amd also, nvidia has driver issues as well, to be honest.  But yes, some issues are too annoying and updating drivers is lottery at this point. I would advice against updating drivers unless you need it for specific new game or have the latest video cards - rx 9070 \[xt\]  or 9060 xt .  I should have sold the 7700 xt and bought 9060 xt 16gb instead but too late for that now and it has problems as well, so lottery as i said, its a risk.",Negative
AMD,"I see, btw I'm just telling the natural AMD trends on its major update/features on its GPU (kinda). Wish it coming sooner..",Neutral
AMD,lmao chill out dude go touch some grass,Neutral
AMD,Could be grounds for lawsuit… That’s funny!,Neutral
AMD,Because of MPO.,Neutral
AMD,yeah same with 25.11.1 25.9.2 works for me,Positive
AMD,"25.10.2 was the previous WHQL, so also yes :P",Positive
AMD,"Huh, seems to be running in DX12 for me, as reported by MSI AB, and FSR4 is working",Neutral
AMD,Which driver version and does it still crashing?,Neutral
AMD,OK I will install it now and test it and get back to you. Give me 10 mins.,Neutral
AMD,Yuppp. It does not work on bf6 but it works on ark survival ascended for me. Seems it might be a bf issue. I saw ppl saying they were getting more fps with this driver in BF6 but I think they didn't realize it's using FSR 3.1 and not 4.,Negative
AMD,Try using DDU to uninstall your current drivers and do a clean install of the 25.10.2 combined drivers if you havent already (you can find it here):  https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-25-10-2.html,Neutral
AMD,"Yup just need to say ""No""",Neutral
AMD,"whew thanks, good think i noticed it first before updating. i have 25.10.2 and 25.9.2 here and they both have windows 10 along their filename so i might as well asked.",Positive
AMD,I don't see how it would work on 23.9.1 lol,Negative
AMD,"Did you use DDU to uninstall the drivers and then reinstall using a driver installer from the AMD website? I found this guide yesterday and it was extremely helpful, specifically step 8:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1lnxb8o/ultimate_amd_performance_fix_guide_stop_lag_fps/",Positive
AMD,I did it this morning before the new driver and confirm chipset drivers were untouched,Neutral
AMD,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.  More people use HDMI than what people think and those TVs don’t always have a DP connector at all.,Negative
AMD,"ah, that explains it. Thanks. :)",Positive
AMD,"What if one does not check release notes? V25.10.2 point to different packages, for installing both CPU and GPU you had to download the AutoDetect package (named “minimal install”). Obviously I’m referring to AMD driver download page.",Neutral
AMD,"Okay, as long as they have a workaround for that... I was planning to get a 9060XT, but also keep my 6700XT for lossless scaling frame gen, was worried the branching would affect that..",Neutral
AMD,"What a mess. I have rdna2 and 3 on the same PC, so combined driver is the solution for this? Or auto detect is the only way?",Neutral
AMD,"Damn, that's a huge relief to hear. Most of the frustration came from not knowing whether the issue was even acknowledged.   Thanks a lot for the update.",Positive
AMD,What about Noise Suppression not working since 25.9.2?,Negative
AMD,Finally. The last driver without pink artifacting was 25.4.1  It has been 7 months. AMD Matt acknowledged the bug on [the amd forums](https://pcforum.amd.com/s/question/0D5KZ000011WpJJ0A0/pink-square-artifacting-chrome-discord-and-steam) 5 months ago.  Please let it be fixed with the next driver update. So many 7000series users are on the verge of swapping to Nvidia.  https://i.redd.it/ywrg9at3lp1g1.gif,Neutral
AMD,"what about whatever changed post 25.3.1 for multi monitors? Any driver 25.3.1 and older i can run my main at 200hz, my side at 165, and my third at 60 without issue. Any driver newer than 25.3.1 and running my main at 200hz then playing a game will cause the second monitor (165hz) to flicker, glitch, and freak out the entire time, until the game on the main monitor is closed. Dropping to 165 on the main monitor down from 200hz \*fixes\* the issue but, i paid for 200hz and would like to be able to actually use it again.  (7700xt system)",Neutral
AMD,Hell yeah 🙂 amd I appreciate you see the issues Iv been a fan boy for a long time and I know it will be fixed,Positive
AMD,"Hi. Sorry, I thought this was pretty common as I've had this issue with two different systems and 3 AMD GPUs across 2 generations. [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1jayump/chrome_full_screen_freezes_after_switching_to_amd/) [Or here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/3890720/parts-of-screen-freezes-when-using-chrome) Chrome (or other Chromium browsers, I've had this happen with Edge too) in fullscreen, with graphics acceleration enabled.   Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",Neutral
AMD,"Keep in mind this only actually matters if one protocol or the other is **actually** limiting bandwidth for the [resolution * FPS] you want to display on your monitor  For instance, DP 1.4 can do ~25Gbits/s, which translates to roughly 1440p @ 240fps, or 4k @ 120fps  If you have proper cable into HDMI 2.1, it should be able to do ~42Gbits/s, which would instead be 4k @ 190fps  Read up the wikipedia tables for bandwidth specs and resolution / fps / bit depth rates for more",Neutral
AMD,Yeah most people are still have dp 1.4 monitors though. No way I'm swapping my monitor just for dp 2.1 as it's just too awesome. Although these tandem OLED screens look interesting... Hmm lol,Positive
AMD,"lol, listened too much to linus  https://youtu.be/g3FkuZNSGkw?t=261",Neutral
AMD,That was my very first actual driver issue I experienced with AMD.,Negative
AMD,Oh that's nice! I'll look into it when I get the chance.,Positive
AMD,Cool. Thank you,Positive
AMD,I might turn on ray tracing in like a medium or low setting just for shits and giggles or screenshots but I don't plan on playing with it on all the time since I'll also play at 1440p so I don't wanna have a really bad experience 😖,Negative
AMD,Exactly! It's insane. I can't believe running through a translation layer is more stable than running native,Positive
AMD,"but i dont know something is also wrong with 25.11.1 ... AMD Adrenalin randomly vanishes from tray     i dont want to roll back to 25.9.1 :-(    but this version was the last which was good so far      maybe when we have luck amd is able to provide next time a ""perfect"" driver without any issues?",Negative
AMD,"Could be it, nothing hardware wise at all and just software too.     Yeah, you're not the 1st I've read that says they have issues on the game.     If you're crashing and the system reboots it does make me think of some stability issues and not really just GPU, but I'm guessing you've already tried stability tests and using the system without OC+A-XMP/EXPO disabled.     Once upon a time I remember reading some people, on other instances and other games, having crashes like that (complete reboot) due to PSU instability as well.     Good luck!",Neutral
AMD,That's strange. My game defaulted to everything maxed out including running ray tracing and I haven't noticed any issues. The game runs incredibly well.  I've got a 5800X3D & 9070XT as well.,Positive
AMD,"Fair enough, and yeah sooner the better for all of us",Positive
AMD,It absolutely could be.  Europe has some pretty good consumer law and promising features that could impact your purchase decision are part of this law.  It can fall under misleading advertisement,Neutral
AMD,"It's not freezing, it's just that the GPU usage is practically at 100% all the time, even with V-Sync enabled. With the 25.9 drivers, this doesn't happen, and the clock speed varies normally, increasing and decreasing as needed when V-Sync is enabled. These 25.10 drivers are causing the GPU to consume more energy unnecessarily.",Neutral
AMD,Fingers crossed,Neutral
AMD,"Allright ty, will Install new, any differences in performance?",Neutral
AMD,"im running 25.11.1 on win10 7900xt. no problems besides afmf2 breaking the performance overlay, which ive had for multiple updates now",Neutral
AMD,I don't think you understand what I mean.. If you downgrade to that you can get fsr 4 to work on 6000 series without having to change any files.,Neutral
AMD,Thank you for this. This was very helpful. Got adrenaline working fine now.,Positive
AMD,"I wish my LG C4 42"" had a display port. Its my primary monitor.",Positive
AMD,"Yep, AMD is not so quick in fixing their driver download page, I still can remember when X870E chipset came out but you found only X670 option. The drivers were the same, but man it’s your flagship chipset! Anyway, drivers install but Adrenalin App does not work for me… and have zero time to reinstall Windows.",Negative
AMD,"I feel like AMD can do a bit of a better job communicating this, despite Vik's great efforts in this subreddit. Just saying: hey guys, we know about this, it sucks, bear with us please can make things better in the long run in my opinion.",Neutral
AMD,"We've not observed anything like this internally, and I've personally not seen this at all in the field. This one may be specific to your display combination. I'll talk to a colleague in our display team about what we can do to learn more about that behaviour on your side - we might ask you to capture a special kind of log file during a state when your secondary display is blanking with gameplay on the primary",Neutral
AMD,Can you tell us what content you have on the secondary panel when it starts misbehaving? Is this behaviour affected if you disable VRR on it too?,Neutral
AMD,"I see. I recall the partial display freeze being related to DWM & multi plane overlay in Windows. One of our community testers encountered this and remedied with the overlayminFPS DWORD here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/1kgp7ar/cause_and_solution_to_windows_24h2_related/?sort=new  If you're getting TDRs, with chome(ium) + gameplay, pass us over a kernel memory dmp and we'll take a look into it",Neutral
AMD,"Oh yeah I noticed that too when watching it, kinda funny of him to say it as it's on screen",Positive
AMD,I've had a really stable 60 fps experience even with path tracing (minus the crashes) but I'm on a 9070 with fsr 4 on quality,Positive
AMD,Can't comment on the vanishing of the tray since I have mine configured to hide it from tray always.,Neutral
AMD,also i have coil whine since this driver 25.11.1. ?!  also in idle sometimes...  very strange driver...,Negative
AMD,Every roadmap since forever has a small print disclaimer at the bottom at the page saying that release times are subject to change.,Neutral
AMD,"I upgraded from 25.9 because it started crashing, it was not crashing until yesterday, also I have limited gpu usage, clockspeed it is working sometimes, sometimes not.",Neutral
AMD,Didn't really paid attention to it :( but at least my game doesn't crash anymore!!,Negative
AMD,"did you download the same filename with the one i mentioned? i tried downloading windows 11 link and it also gave me the same filename, lol",Neutral
AMD,No you can't.,Neutral
AMD,"I don' think you understand either, 25.9.1 is that driver, 23.9.1 was released in 2023 before FSR 4 was even a thing.",Negative
AMD,"Glad I could help, the crashes on Arc Raiders were pissing me off big style so I wanted to share what helped me.",Positive
AMD,"They are TV's, not pc monitors. Buy the right tool for the job",Neutral
AMD,"I couldn't find the DWM key so I made one, we'll see if that fixes it. Thank you for replying. But please, forward it to someone. There must be people out there on AMD hardware that are not tech savvy and this just breeds bad reputation.",Neutral
AMD,"Nope, that didn't fix it. Chrome continues to forget to update its display. And WoW continues to crash in the background leading to massive stutters when panning the camera around quickly, along with plenty of other odd behaviours.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, I'm facing the same issue on RX 9060 XT   Is it a GPU driver issue, or a Windows issue that Microsoft needs to fix?",Negative
AMD,"That's not how it works. Small print won't save you from stuff like this, you think that they can stop releasing this software for 2-3 years because some small print said 'Subject to change'?   European consumer law would absolutely support the consumer in this case. If you promise a feature by a certain date, you will need to deliver it. If the development takes way too long, you are in for a ride",Negative
AMD,What about 25.11.1?,Neutral
AMD,Yeah same for me. Considering how similair win10 and 11 are under the hood i just went with it. Still absolutely no problems sofar.,Positive

AMD,Did you reboot after setting that key? Is the display with chrome still only partially updating?,Neutral
AMD,"Haha. Sure thing buddy. If that would be the case, that a small print on a roadmap can't save a company, we would have hundreds of lawsuits in EU. You must be new to the hardware scene.",Negative
AMD,thank you,Positive
AMD,"Uh huh, yeah I did it too. You still have the overwrite DLLs. Hence the flipping tutorial. Completely irrelevant to this topic, anyways.",Negative
AMD,"Not a typo, I was asking about something else and he missed my point...",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, it can't.   They could add that they can sell your organs, doesn't make it legal though.   Also lawsuits usually don't happen because of a feature or if they happen, in a very small amount that isn't meaningful. Class action also doesn't exist in Europe, so obviously you won't hear about it like in the USA.",Negative
AMD,"But flipping the dlls could get you banned from online games , that's why i was wondering if it's finally fixed in this update and we wouldn't have to flip the dlls anymore..",Negative
AMD,"You literally claimed we could do this without overwriting any files, that was obviously false.  Anyway, no. I would not expect AMD to bring FSR4 to RDNA3 anytime soon, if at all.",Negative
AMD,Another day another strix halo mini pc reveal by an unknown local oem with 10 shipments per month if they’re lucky.,Neutral
AMD,"The most important characteristics of a laptop are battery life ( power efficiency) and screen quality. That is what sells ( non apple ) clamshells.    All the other crap they test in various reviews are mostly meaningless to the actual user. There is a very small %age of the market for high power/perf laptops and even smaller market for gaming.   Most of the reason a laptop is “slow” is bloatware and has nothing to do with the cpu choice anyway.  And Intel is already “beating” AMD in laptop cpu sales, by a substantial margin. People incorrectly assume AMD has most of the market share in all segments because of the very noisy and super-biased gaming reviewers, who mostly focus on $3000+ gaming desktop builds. Yes AMD is handily winning there.",Neutral
AMD,"I have a T14s Gen 5 Core Ultra 5 135U and recently I saw \~9h of battery life, browsing websites. It's quite nice piece of hardware so with Lunar Lake it would be just perfect. Of course not for heavy workload because for this we will have Panther Lake.

AMD,lol. Even in the cons it says weaker multicore than AMD….?   This article seems like AI wrote it,Negative
AMD,At work we are a Lenovo shop and recently swapped from Intel to AMD T14 laptops. Too many issues with Intel and the AMD models offer the same performance for less money.,Negative
AMD,Suck at gaming.,Neutral
AMD,Try a modern mac and tell me its not the CPU holding the UX back. It's all about the cpu's.,Neutral
AMD,"That would be nice. We have a bunch of laptops with Intel's i5, 13th gen I believe it was. 2 p-cores, some e-cores. They are all slow as fuck. I mean it. The CPU is so extremely slow and goes into tdp limit right away. Most users hate them.  Battery life is ok, but they are really bad in terms of performance.  So - I wouldn't say CPU doesn't matter.",Negative
AMD,"AMD is held back in laptops by some shady deals of laptop manufacturers with Intel. It's impossible to get a 4k AMD laptop with 5090 for example, all of those are Intel (I found literally one AMD laptop like that compared to 25 from Intel). That's utterly ridiculous.",Negative
AMD,">The most important characteristics of a laptop are battery life ( power efficiency) and screen quality. That is what sells ( non apple ) clamshells.  I fully agree with what you said and this makes me wonder what in the genuine fuck was going through Lenovo's head when pricing their Thinkpad line of laptops. They're all wildly, and I mean WILDLY overpriced for what they offer, speaking as objectively as possible.  For the average Joe there's still no beating getting a refurbished Snapdragon X Elite laptop with 16 or 32GB or RAM at a €800 pricepoint. Nothing comes close in battery life, and these laptops come with decent OLED.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, so much of laptop performance is dictated by things other than the cpu. Its kinda wild.   Intel does a way better job getting good laptop designs. Amd historically has just been a cpu seller, telling oems to go wild and do whatever . . . And it always ends very badly.   The biggest sign amd is taking share is not cpu benchmarks, but will be things like having premium screens, good thermals, lack of bloatware, dual channel memory, good SSDs, good colors, etc etc. and . . . ACTUAL AVAILABILITY. I dunno how many reviews i see where they review and intel and amd parts. Usually there is some way intel has a better premium finish. And then amd just has zero ways to actually buy their model. Its the weirdest thing.",Negative

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance. I’ve shown full system specs and game settings every time, and provided more evidence than any tech site or tech YouTuber ever has, yet some people are still in denial.

HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU. Ironically the 9070 performance was identical with a 9700X and a 9800X3D.  So it's actually kind of the reverse, gaming reviewers painted Arrow Lake in the worst possible light.",Neutral

AMD,I doubt they would give false numbers. Those are probably what you get with the setup they list in fine print. Also they pretty clearly show the 3dx parts are faster in gaming. But they have probably picked examples that show them in a good light.   There is nothing wrong per se in the arrow lake lineup. In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all. The issue that destroyed the image of arrow lake is that the previous generation was often faster in gaming. That made every reviewer give it bad overall reviews.,Neutral

AMD,"As a real world example, I upgraded my primary system from a 14700k to a 265k recently. My other desktop is a ryzen 7900 (non x, 65 watt tdp)  Compiling my os takes 6 minutes on the 7900, 10 minutes on the 265k, 10 minutes on a 3950x, and 16 minutes on the 14700k.   That is not in windows, but my os which does not have thread director or custom scheduling for e cores. (So going to be worse than windows or Linux)   All the numbers except the 7900 are with the same ssd, psu, custom water loop.  The motherboard and cpu changed between Intel builds and the 3950x was the previous build before the 14700k.   The e core performance significantly improved in arrow lake.  It’s now keeping up with 16 core am4 parts in the worst possible scenario for it.  If the scheduler was smarter, I think it would be very close to the 7900.   In windows, it’s pretty close in games I play on frame rate to the old chip. A few are actually faster.",Neutral

Well, you need a new board. So it depends what “cheaper” is seen as.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep. We all see the patterns here. Gamers nexus, HUB, LTT and most big name they all keep mocking Intel, even when Intel did good job to bring improvements to their products like fixing Arrow Lake gaming performance but those ""tech reviewer"" decided to be blind, they don't even want to revisit Intel chip and benchmark it, they don't even want to educate their viewers.    At the same time they keep overhyping Amd products to the moon like they own the stock, it's obvious now who is the real reviewer and who is fraud reviewer using their own popularity and big headline to spread their propaganda for their own benefits.

You can say that all you want but there's a reason why in the diy market everyone is buying amd over intel. People know arrow lake is doa where as am5 actually has a future, which is why everyone is flocking to the 9800x3d in droves.  Zen 7 is rumored to be on am5 as well.

AMD,"I agree with you, it’s daft, no doubt about it. But you’ve got to factor in that people can be daft too. Most tend to skimp, only to end up buying another middling CPU the following year, and then again after that. And so the cycle trundles on.  When I buy PC parts, I usually go for the best available. Provided the price is reasonably sane. I picked up a 9900K seven years ago and it’s still holding its own. Is it on par with the 9800X3D? Of course not. But it’s still a very capable bit of kit. Next time I upgrade, I’ll go top shelf again.",Neutral

AMD,"If only the Arc B770 can beat the RX 9070XT with performance and features, then I definitely stay on Intel's side, but RN I doubt it",Neutral
AMD,"Even accepting that as true, I don’t think it changes the main point I was making. Arrow Lake has probably improved versus a year ago. It’s probably not as good as intel is making out. A good third party reviewer would be needed to determine by how much, yet it’s probably not worth their money and time to test it.   So the truth is probably in between what Intel is saying here and what the state of things was 6 months ago.",Negative

AMD,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets).

AMD,"Most commenters are wrong or didn’t read all the articles. Nvidia wants some custom SKUs of server chips to pair with its data center GPUs, and Intel wanted a better solution for pc parts for the GPU tiles.   NVIDIA is NOT getting an x86 license, nor do they want one. In case you haven’t noticed, Nvidia is a $4T company largely on sales of data center GPUs, sales of which were 10x the gaming segment. Profit/earnings ratio of data center is even higher than the 10x.   In my opinion, the only reason for Intel to use RTX chiplets on pc parts is so they can have a few skus for mobile gaming. Lower end laptop chips would still use Xe cores.  This solves NONE of intel’s structural issues - they need, in this order  1. Major foundry customers  2. Regain server market share 3. Data center GPU offerings 4. Move all pc chiplets back to Intel nodes and start to fill up the fabs again",Neutral

AMD,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive. I know they have a lot of tricks up their sleeves still, like designing HBM memory onto the die (how Vega was supposed to be originally) and unified memory (soldered down, see the new AI branded chips).",Negative
AMD,Ohh noooerrrrrrrrr,Neutral
AMD,"Actually this may be good for AMD and I will tell you why: Open source drivers. Nvidia if they had a say in intels graphics division would make the intel GPU stuff proprietary and locked down and when support ends its gonna hurt. Meanwhile AMD has open source drivers and in the age that linux is gaining popularity will make it the preferred platform for anyone interested in the growing linux ecosystem. Nvidia will NEED to change how they handle things or intel may not be as attractive as they once were, intel has already suffered a massive knock on thier reputation and this may be the mortal wound that can work in AMD's favor.",Neutral
AMD,"I don't see how this means anything at all for AMD in desktop. This is borderline irrelevant for desktop gaming. Most users pick up an Intel or AMD CPU and an NVIDIA dGPU.  APUs don't really exist in desktop gaming.  In mobile? I think most people won't care much. Intel and AMD APUs both offer compelling and reasonable alternatives for everyday usage. Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.

AMD,Intel doesn't have a current gen A310 competitor either.,Neutral
AMD,Theres no way that nvidia is gonna let intel keep producing entry level gpus that directly compete with their own. I know their deals are in regards to apus and to compete with strix halo but nvidia is not gonna invest into a company with a competitor to their gpus.

AMD,IIRC that wss the AMD Turion X2 + NVIDIA 7300Go laptops. Those were notorious for dying.   I also remember some budget laptops with the Turion X2 + ATi 3200 chopsrt graphics would die due to graphics desoldering off the board. The GPU would sit at the end of the heatsink and burn up.

As a company they also seem to be desperate to get income as well and so there is no reason to assume they're going to tolerate that situation for all that much longer.    I doubt they'll entirely kill off their GPU division, they can still do iGPU's which will be good enough and cheaper than paying NV a royalty, but the discrete GPU line is clearly in trouble.",Negative

AMD,"3D cache will eventually become full of assets and dip, if and onlyif IMC is bottlenecked by random memory access.  - the ability for cache to transfer data from memory, to IMC, to cache has a FPS hit (cache hit-rate).

You can easily test this by monitoring 1% lows and increasing memory latency (lowering DDR4 B-die clocks/DDR5 hynix and increasing timings) to see how Cache holds up when full of assets while memory is being bottlenecked-   What games need is 10-12 P-Cores and an IMC capable of high speeds.

Its funny they mostly pick on Unreal Engine 5 as the prime example... That is probably the most complete game engine out there. So naturally its hard to make all that stuff work well togetter... They have litterally some of the best coders and researchers in the business ... Id love to see you do a better job.,Negative
AMD,Mixed cores are awesome if the scheduler would do what i want and there lies the problem and i dont think even AI can solve that yet.,Negative
AMD,"I said IPC of Zen 4 is the SAME and weaker than Zen 4 is weaker than Skymont in IPC. No more no less. As for clocks, the core scales to max 5.2ghz (default 4.6ghz), certainly overall slower than Zen 4. IPC is a comparison about throughput at a given clockspeed. Its a give to compare you will need to match the clocks.  Funny you you should mention latencies, considering that core to core (even accross clusters), latencies of Skymont are better than Lion Cove? So if latency is the issue, it has nothing to do with Skymont and everything to do with the trash uncore they have based on the Meteorlake SOC. Even workstation Crestmont on a different package performs better. Furthermore skymont IPC is measured based on Arrowlake. Arrowlake is worse latency than Raptorlake and Zen already. Latencies have been accounted for.",Negative
AMD,"I play Warthunder almost daily. It’s ridiculously fucking optimized.   I got cyberpunk when it came out, it was a shit show. Elden ring? Mediocre.  Escape from tarkov? Fucking laughable.  Call of duty? 500 terabytes. Besides this small list,  I’ll wait for battlefield 6 (which by the way also has a history of releasing unoptimized)  The one thing I will say is that developers do work hard after releases to optimize their games. I’m just so use to playing Warthunder which almost always works, everyday, perfectly, with no complaints. lol",Negative
AMD,"Do tell how a bigger cache makes games faster, if you are aware of some details.  And, of course, how doubling the already tripled cache will yield perf improvements worth the huge amount of extra money to make such chips.",Neutral

AMD,"It's very specific scenarios where this can unlock new performance, most games it won't do anything or even lower performance.     So they can't *really expand it* since it's an uncommon scenario. That's why we have so few games that benefit from it.",Negative
AMD,Never count out Intel. They have some very talented people over there.,Positive
AMD,"Regarding the cache optimizations you pointed out, I have a question. Can you test all APO supported games you own and capture the utilization of the E-cores ?  My understanding is that Intel is keeping 1 E-core per cluster active and parking the remaining 3 E-cores. So the lone E-core of each cluster has full access to the 4mb shared L2. For the i9 they can have 4 such solitary E-cores that have their own cache and hence do not touch the L3 cache. The 4 E-cores handle background task while the 8 P-cores with the full 36mb L3 cache deal with the games.  Please correct me if I am wrong.  Also, what cpu cooler do you use ?",Neutral

AMD,How is this doing the game developers work?,Neutral
AMD,"It's updated as far as I know, but not for every platform.  If you're on Arrow Lake you have the new games that were added, but if you're still on Raptor Lake then you only have the original titles.

AMD,"They have added a few new games, but it appears you need to have Arrow Lake to be able to apply APO on them which is BS!  They need to have a better system than this.

AMD,"When combined with Nova Lake's bLLC, it could give Intel a major edge over AMD's X3D.       And yeah, limiting it to certain games and certain CPUs is a real downer for the technology, so hopefully Intel can find a way to streamline and expand it when Nova Lake launches.",Positive
AMD,"AFAIK, it's recommended to use Balanced mode for proper use of the efficiency cores if you have a Raptor Lake or Arrow Lake CPU",Neutral
AMD,Balanced in full load will just do the same thing as High Performance.,Neutral
AMD,"It's capable of a few things, but the main mechanism from what I've seen is that it temporarily disables three out of four cores in each E-core cluster by forcing them into the lowest power state. The result is that the remaining active core has access to each cluster's full L2 cache (2MB on 12th-gen, 4MB on 13th/14th-gen). L2 cache isn't shared with P-cores (L3 is global), so this can really minimize E-core cache evictions before they're forced into slower memory, and games do love themselves some cache.  It's a genuinely clever way of maximizing available resources and I really wish they'd allow user control over its features, but it seems to be pretty tightly leashed to/by the team that developed it. It obviously wouldn't benefit every situation, such as particularly low/high thread occupancy situations, but it's pretty rough to have the option tied to quarterly updates for one or two specific games.",Neutral

AMD,They are they came up with ML for their upscaller before the red team did and even better than FSR as a dump upscaler and they also did a good RT implementation. But the hardware still has raw horse power issues and they already use a big die for what it can do.  In the 80's or they shammed The DEC Alpha team on subnormal floating point operations with the 8087 FPU. Intel was doing way more precession without having to round so earlier on a consumer FPU while the Alpha CPU was a Mainframe one. Intel also gave it up to help estandardize the way CPUs handle floating point types.  Intel compilers were also black magic becuase they optimized so much C and C++ for Intel specifically but there was always controversy causeless AMD x86 couldn't take part of those optimizations,Neutral
AMD,Were there any background tasks running when the screenshot was captured ? I want to see how the E-cores are assigned for the background tasks under APO.,Neutral
AMD,In certain games. It's not universal at all. There would be scenarios where it gets an edge but if AMD is pushing as hard as rumors state they may still have the better CPUs overall.,Neutral
AMD,"Great explanation that makes sense!  It definitely has to do with the cache, that much is true.   A Raptor Lake CPU with 8 P cores and no efficiency cores, with 36MB of L3 would perform exceptionally well in games.   But the efficiency cores have their uses as well in highly parallel tasks.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah it's a pretty cool, yet simple idea. It would be really nice to give users more granular control natively.",Positive

AMD,"I never said it was better than X3D, only that it is useful as a foil.       Remember that Nova Lake will have bLLC, which is the answer to X3D.  But in conjunction with APO, it may give Intel the edge and help them regain the gaming crown in the next cycle provided they can streamline and expand the technology.",Positive
AMD,"Actually, it is better than X3D in almost every GPU/CPU combo where the GPU throttles. Intel 14th gen almost universally wins 1% lows and frequently FPS - almost universally in 4k gaming, but as I said, when the GPU throttles at any resolution, which is almost always, Intel wins.",Positive
AMD,"Eh, they're very good but they benefited vastly from AMDs mistakes and the lessons learned from it. Remember AMD didn't have any ai hardware for their first 2 gens on RDNA and RDNA 3 didn't have enough for FSR4 either. It's not that intel were better at producing a ML upscaler. They just had the hardware for it from the get go so they could implement it quicker.  They did make Xess though which is miles ahead of FSR 3 even on AMD systems (on average. FSR3 is pretty good when modded and can be competitive) so they do have some extremely talented people there.

AMD,"Which they already do, and are often overworked and underappreciated for.   But sure, it's their fault they didn't optimize the game even more for a subset of already relatively high end CPUs....",Negative
AMD,"You are massively oversimplifying. A lot of games that support APO, like Metro Exodus EE OP used as an example, were released before Intel released CPUs with P and E cores. Expecting studios to rework and optimize old games for new CPUs is very naive.",Neutral

AMD,> i am not talking about older games. i am talking about newer games.... really dude?  New games seldom have problems with P and E cores.

AMD,"Yeah more and more games are adding DLSS support, so I'm not sure when I would need Xess",Neutral
AMD,"That's true but in edge cases where even the lightest Xess option is still too heavy, FSR may still deliver a better overall experience.   E.g. CP2077 on the steam Deck in Dog Town. When I was testing some stuff out (trying to see how close I could get my Deck to the Switch 2 build) I found Xess to be a unsuitable. Even on the lightest Xess mode, the performance hit was a bit too noticeable. FSR doesn't look as good as Xess but it runs better and you can get away with a bit more upscaling artifacting on the Decks relatively small screen. Just rendering at a lower res and letting the screen upscale was also a solid option in that scenario.  As I say though, that's an edge case where you really just need outright speed. If your GPU doesn't support DLSS or FSR4 then using Xess makes sense in the vast majority of cases.",Neutral
AMD,Are you sure you're not getting the DP4A/Shader Model 6.4 and Arc exclusive version mixed up? DP4a was added to Shader Model 6.4. https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki/Shader-Model-6.4.

Intel's Nova Lake processors are expected to feature the memory controller integrated back into the CPU tile and if that's the case this L3 might be a really big hit for gaming, etc.",Positive
AMD,If latency slightly increases or stays the same due to adopting Pantherlake optimizations and the newer Foveros then that might be enough to narrow the gap,Neutral
AMD,I assume the cache is based on Lunar Lake's memory side cache which doesn't bring much if any noticeable latency over Arrowlake H,Neutral
AMD,"Also done with them. Changing socket every \~3 years was also bad, but this is disgusting.",Negative
AMD,"Not sure how it could be, given all the extra cores.  That said, for lower core count workloads, like gaming, I doubt gains of more than 10% are achievable by anyone, at this point.  I expect NVL to be a big power/thermals/multithreading win, than anything else.",Neutral

AMD,"It shouldn't become an entry level workstation part since the Ryzen 9 will have 24c/48t to go against it.   48 cores (plus the 4 LPe, but those shouldn't factor in too much) should handily beat 48 threads, but not by enough to reach Threadripper territory.",Neutral
AMD,Most likely the bLLC variant wil be single compute tile and single cache tile as this would be cheaper for now than putting bLLC cache in base tile like Amd did. They can do that when 18A-PT is avaliable which will probably be after Nova Lake goes into production with 18A or maybe 18A-P,Neutral
AMD,"Lmao, some of my games still runs on e cores",Neutral
AMD,People are still disabling e cores for more performance.,Neutral

AMD,fym no different they're 50% faster,Neutral
AMD,No. ARL architecture is definitely not optimized for latency but hiding memory access which favours multithreading instead of gaming. Hopefully Nova Lake will optimize all the latecy issues with ARL arch and decrease latency to L3 considerably aswell,Negative
AMD,"Yes, but in games, it's the P-cores that are meant to be utilized. Also, more than eight cores or 16 threads aren't really necessary for gaming. The 9950x3d isn't faster, than the 9900x3d.  My point is that the space taken up by the E-cores could instead be used for additional cache, not?",Neutral
AMD,I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it. Anyhow if that's true the large L3 should be even more helpful for things like gaming as it will keep those higher latency hits down. AMD has always had higher latency due to the same kind of design with a separate memory controller so we have pretty good data on how extra cache can help.,Neutral
AMD,"As a advice, Nova Lake will further increase memory latency.",Neutral
AMD,In which gen iteration?,Neutral
AMD,Editorialized. But its funny because said quote is attributed to AMD when Intel made Core2Duo (or Quad?),Neutral
AMD,"If its is with 10% of threadripper 9960x at half the price, it will definitely hurt the low end threadripper cpus a lot for productivity/creator types who would love a more reasonable priced high performance entry level workstaion. Low end workstation is probably bigger market than high end gaming desktops anyways.",Negative
AMD,"Another factor is that Apple has booked out all the N2 capacity for the better part of a year before AMD can touch it.  Nova Lake will have been out for a while, before AMD shows up",Neutral
AMD,Process lasso can let you just designate by task so the E cores can do background and side jobs. People use process lasso on the 7950x3d to make the X3D chiplet run games with those 8 cores and the other 8 core chiplet for everything else.,Neutral
AMD,What issue did you run into with a 9800x3d? It has one CCD and no small cores,Neutral
AMD,"Nowadays there are very few cases where disabling E cores is extremely beneficial, sometimes they are a detriment to performance but more often than not they are useful. Not to mention the E core design team is more competent than the P core team and are quickly catching up in performance.    The E cores in Alder Lake had relatively poor ST performance but in Arrow Lake they are much faster and closer to the P cores in raw performance. Every new generation the gap keeps shrinking and it will make the disabling of E cores less and less relevant.    Sometimes the Windows scheduler will wrongly assign an E core to a ST bound task, even if a P core is available, but it doesn't happen often enough to be a serious issue.",Neutral
AMD,"yes, but not because of windows scheduling - its because you can OC higher with them off - better temps and easier stability - some people disable HT for the same.",Neutral
AMD,They don't pay attention,Negative
AMD,"No. Intel needs to do what Amd did and add seperate bLLC just for gaming. As long as latency is reduced to the L3 cache including bLLC, gaming performance will definitely increase as 285K and 9950x have similar performance in both gaming and productivity with small lead going to Amd. But x3d totally dominates ARL beacsue of the obvious huge cache difference and lower overall latency to their cache implementation.",Neutral
AMD,That is more so bc the 9950x3d isn’t really a 16 core cpu it is two 8 cores,Neutral
AMD,"There was one article a while back that reported something like ""intel goes back to integrated mc"", not understanding that panther lake is a fundamentally different product than the tile based desktop products.",Neutral
AMD,How do you think they're doing 2 compute tiles if the memory controller is on one?,Neutral
AMD,">I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it.  I'm curious, which leakers have said otherwise?   You could still have mem latency improvements without the mem controller being on the compute tile too, so the situation there can improve either way.   >AMD has always had higher latency due to the same kind of design with a separate memory controller so we have pretty good data on how extra cache can help  Yup, and ARL has higher mem latency than AMD even, so obviously there is room to improve even without having to move the mem controller back.",Neutral
AMD,"Intel will definitely decrease latency with Nova lake and as long as they add a bigger L3 cache variant, gaming performance will increase further to challenge AMD",Positive
AMD,"If you go straight to the source, the quote they used is directly on Intel's slides. Intel literally wrote that, regardless of who said it first.   [https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pPtQr2PKSemDqkhahtz8VN.jpg](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pPtQr2PKSemDqkhahtz8VN.jpg)",Neutral

Also, if AMD wants to pay for TSMC N2 capacity, TSMC will build it out. Just a couple days ago we had a [report](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250724PD213/tsmc-2nm-capacity-2028-3nm.html) about TSMC being very aggressive with N2 scale out, and the reasoning here is two fold- first of all, 2026 is technically the 2nd year of N2 HVM, and also because a *lot* of major SOCs, other than just Apple and AMD, will be on N2- demand for N2 is high, and build out will be too.",Neutral

AMD,"Yes but IF Intel decides to do quad channel for AI nonsense at least for flagship model, Amd threadripper will be stomped over as I will definitely buy the Nova Lake part just for the price/performance compared to 9960x threadripper. The motherboard selection alone for Z890 is absolutely amazing and RDIMM prices aretwice as expensive for the same amount of memory. I expect with CAMM2 that max ram capaciity will go for 512GB and maybe 1TB for Nova Lake aswell. Even with 2 channel, cudimm will go above 10,000 MTS and maybe 12000 if we are lucky on CAMM2 modules by 2027 as CAMM2 definitely being used for DDR6   I do feel Intel has I/O advantage beyong gaming and that market is getting bigger than hardcore gamers all the time!! A decked out 256GB Arrow Lake z890 based computer is way cheaper than same memory sized threadripper 9960x.",Positive
AMD,"I don't recall Intel stating that NVL core chips would be at TSMC, only that some of the eventual package would be... which implies iGPU, to me, and that wouldn't be N2 (possibly N4, since Battlemage is N5, and N4 would be open and cheaper than N3 nodes).  Do you have a source, where they directly claim the NVL cores are coming from TSMC?",Neutral
AMD,"The game is a dumpster fire when it comes to CPU utilization, it hammers even top tier gaming chips like the 9800X3D. I'm not surprised if the E cores can bottleneck the performance even further, most likely some of the game's heaviest threads get (wrongly) assigned to the E cores.    The scheduling in W11 has been significantly improved over the last few years but it's not 100% perfect either. Legacy software in particular, which typically utilizes 1 core, often ends up running in an E core and as a result you can't take advantage of the higher ST performance a P core provides. In that case you need stuff like Process Lasso to fix the problem. It doesn't happen very often but when it does it's very annoying.",Negative

AMD,"That seems really strange, since ARL was designed for both 18A and N3, and they just went with N3 at the time.  Now that 18A is ready, and capacity is reserved for Intel themselves, you'd think NVL would just plain be fabbed there.  Maybe the 18A fabs are so busy with Clearwater Lake orders, that they would go with TSMC again?  That seems like something they couldn't have known in 2024.",Neutral

AMD,Is anyone left?,Neutral
AMD,"Wonder what node such a product, if it does exist, would use for the iGPU tile.   AFAIK, rumor is that the iGPU tile for the standard parts would be on 18A or an 18A variant. However, if this is a flagship part, I would assume they would be willing to pay the extra cost to use N2...   However that would also presumably involve porting the architecture over to another node, which I don't think Intel has the resources, or wants to go through the effort, to do so.   Also wonder if such a product will finally utilize the ADM cache that has been rumored since like, forever.   And this is a bit of a tangent, but I swear at this point in the leak cycle for a new Intel product, there's always usually a ton of different skus that are leaked that may or may not launch - right now we have NVL bLLC, NVL standard, and now this, and a bunch of them end up not launching (whether they were cut internally, or the leaks were just made up). So it would be pretty interesting to see if any of the more specialized rumored NVL skus end up actually launching.",Neutral

AMD,The 7850HS can't compete with the Xe2 igpu because it's bandwidth starved.   The 8mb of memory side cache insulating the 4mb of L2 from main memory allows the Xe2 Arc 140V igpu in LL clocked at 1950mhz to beat the RDNA 3.5 890m clocked at 2950mhz as it only has 4mb of L2 as a last level of cache before hitting memory.

AMD,"The low volume part of that quote is important. If you're making heaps of them, each can take up a little bit of the startup costs for that design. If you only make a few, those costs get concentrated on what you do make.  Low volume also means a single defect is promotionally more of your possible units, and hits the margins harder. You do get more total defects in a larger run, but at sufficiently high quantities of those defects, you start making lower bins to recover some of the defects. If you hardly make the volume to cover one widespread SKU, you aren't likely to have enough to make a cheaper one with any degree of availability.

I still remember i got banned from that trash sub for saying ""People need to touch grass and stop pretending like AMD is still underdog because they aren't"" and the Amd mods sure really mad after seeing my comment got 100+ upvotes for saying the truth, but that doesn't matter anymore because i also ban those trash sub!",Negative
AMD,Intel should be ahead of the curve on things not looking to compete on previously created tech,Neutral
AMD,"Very fine-tuned ARL-S almost reach 9800X3D performance. Extra cache could help to close the gap   Given people are willing to overpay for price-inflated 9800X3D, I wonder if it could work given buyers need an entirely new platform. 9800X3D users are fine for a pretty long time like 5800X3D users did",Positive
AMD,"Lol, requires a new socket. Intel is such trash.",Negative
AMD,Intel will simply always be better than amd,Positive
AMD,"AMD gains tremendously from X3D/v$ because the L3 cache runs at core speeds and thus is fairly low latency, Intel hasn't seen such low latency L3 caches since skylake, which also has much smaller sizes, so the benefits of this could be much less than what AMD sees.   Only one way to find out, but I advise some heavy skepticism on the topic of ""30% more gaming perf from 'intel's v$'""",Positive
AMD,"Either more cache or resurrecting the HEDT X-series... Doesn't matter, as long as there is an affordable high-end product line.",Neutral
AMD,"The 12600k was a fine chip, but AMD had the ace up Its sleeve. I upgraded from a 12600k to a 7950x3d and it was one of the best PC upgrades I ever made.",Positive
AMD,I mean 9800x3D and 14900K offers basically the same performance in the enthusiast segment. Going forward though it would be nice to have more cache so normal users doesn't have to do any sort of memory overclocking just to match 9000x3D in gaming.,Neutral
AMD,4070 ti won’t cut it man - upgrade!,Negative
AMD,Broadwell could have been so interesting had it planned out.,Positive
AMD,"I want a 32 Core/64 Thread 3.40 GHz Core i9-like CPU. Not Xeon like with Quad-Channel and stuff, just 40 PCIe 5.0 lanes and 32 Power-Cores instead of little.big design. 😬",Neutral
AMD,">Otherwise AMD will see a clear opportunity to bring prices up  AMD already did, as you can see zen 5 x3d is overpriced as hell especially the 8 core CPU. Zen 5 is overpriced compared to zen 4 which is already more expensive than zen 3. Not to mention they did shady business like keep doing rebranding old chip as the new series to fools people into thinking it was new architecture when it wasn't and sell it with higher price compared to chip on the same architecture in old gen.  Intel surely needed to kick Amd ass because Amd keep milking people with the same 6 and 8 cores CPU over and over with price increases too! Not to mention radeon is the same by following nvidia greedy strategy.  Edit: Some mad Amd crowd going to my history just to downvote every of my comments because they are salty as hell, i won't be surprised if there are from trash sub r/hardware. But truth to be told, your downvote won't change anything!!",Negative
AMD,"Even though it's not stacked, I believe it's still going to fix the last level cache latency issue MTL and ARL have.   Ryzen CPUs have lower L3 latency than Intel because each CCX gets their own independent L3, unlike Intel's shared L3. Now in NVL, the BLLC configuration will replace half of the P-core and E-core tiles with L3, so possibly giving the existing cores/tiles their own independent L3, improving latency and bandwidth over shared L3.  But one thing intrigues me. If this cache level has lower latency than shared L3, wouldn't this more properly be called L2.5 or something below L3 rather than last level cache? Will NVL even still have shared L3 like the previous Intel CPUs? I know the rumor that it will have shared L2 per two cores, but we know nothing of the L3 configuration.",Neutral
AMD,"> On one hand, this shouldn't cause any thermal and Fmax implications like 3D stacking has created for AMD's chips, however doing this would prob also make the latency hit of increasing L3 capacity worse too.  It is already a non-issue since AMD moved the 3D V-Cache to underneath the compute tile.",Neutral
AMD,"Adamantaium was on the interposer, did they change plans?",Neutral
AMD,"Don't remember them saying anything like that, but by around that time their 18A packaging is supposed to be ready for 3D stacking.",Neutral
AMD,"Nova lake= skip of it's just as good as zen, you would be looking at 2 gens after that and then swap from AM5 to intel.",Positive
AMD,"> If a 4+8-core Ultra 3 425K can match an 8+0 core Ryzen AI 5 competing product in gaming  Doubt that since it'll probably lack hyperthreading and the E-Cores are slower, even 6C12T CPUs are starting to hit their limits in games in the last few years, faster cores won't help if there's much less resources to go around, it kinda feels like intel went backwards when they removed hyperthreading without increasing the P-Core count.",Negative
AMD,Intel managed to run Sandy Bridge's ring bus clock speeds at core clocks which resulted in 30 cycles of L3 latency.   Haswell disaggreated core and ring clocks allowing for additional power savings.   Arrow Lake's L3 latency is 80 cycles with a ring speed of 3.8ghz,Neutral
AMD,"I'd like to see the HEDT X-series come back too, but Intel would have to come up with something that would be competitive in that area.  It's not hard to see why Intel dropped the series when you take a look at the Sapphire Rapids Xeon-W lineup they would have likely been based off of.  I think AMD would also do well to offer something that's a step above the Ryzen lineup, rather than a leap above it like the current Threadrippers.",Neutral
AMD,Well it was a downgrade on system snappiness as intel have way higher random reads than amd.,Neutral
AMD,> I mean 9800x3D and 14900K offers basically the same performance  LMAO,Neutral
AMD,"Huh? 9800x3d is universally known to be like 20-25 percent faster, even in 1 percent lows.   https://www.techspot.com/review/2931-amd-ryzen-9800x3d-vs-intel-core-14900k/",Neutral
AMD,Maybe that is your experience.  Neverthelesss if you compare most gamers who switched to 9800x3D they report a significantly noticeable uplift in fps and 0.1 fps. Maybe a negligible few reported a decrease. And this has very likely nothing to do with the x3D CPU but other causes.,Neutral
AMD,"Ah you’re missing the final piece. As far as i’m aware this pretty much requires controlling the OS as well (or at least solid OS support). Consoles get their own custom operating system, Apple built a new version of MacOS for M chips. Intel and AMD though don’t control windows.",Neutral
AMD,UMA is such a hassle That's why I don't see it much except for calculation purposes (HPC/AI)...,Negative
AMD,"Application developers are supposed to try to avoid copies from GPU memory to CPU memory, instead letting it stay in the GPU memory as much as possible",Neutral
AMD,">so there is still the cost of useless copies between system RAM vs allocated GPU ram.    There is none, AMDGPU drivers have supported GTT memory since forever, so static allocation part is just to reduce burden for app developers but if you use GTT memory you can do zero-copy CPU+GPU hybrid processing.",Negative
AMD,"Intel needs something decent because AMD has taken a page out of intel (up to gen7) playbook, same cores no changes. Intel now provides more cores but it's the 100% core increase Vs AMD 50% and bLLC that should shake things up, hopefully they keep the temperature down as I don't want to have to replace case and get a 360mm rad just to not throttle, and not ever again do a 13th and 14th gen degradation show.   If all goes well going back to intel for a few years then AMD, brand loyalty is for suckers, buy what's best for performance and value. Hopefully intel i5 has 12P cores and i7 18-20P cores that would be nice to have",Neutral
AMD,"bLLC is just a big-ass L3$ and since Intel does equal L3 slices per coherent ring stop, it'll be 6\*12 or 12\*12 with each slice doubling or quadrupling. The rumor is 144MB so quadrupled per slice, probably 2x ways and 2x sets to keep L3 latency under control.",Neutral
AMD,"Intel and AMD have effectively the same client L3 strategy. It's only allocated local to one compute die. Intel just doesn't have any multi-compute die parts till NVL.   > Now in NVL, the BLLC configuration will replace half of the P-core and E-core tiles with L3  8+16 is one tile, in regardless of how much cache they attach to it",Neutral
AMD,It is a massive issue for amd. You're voltage limited like crazy as electron migration kills the 3D cache really fucking fast. 1.3V is already dangerous voltage for the cache.,Negative
AMD,"I still think there's a slight impact (the 9800x3d only boosts up to 5.2GHz vs the 5.5GHz of the 9700x), but compared to Zen 4, the issue does seem to have been lessened, yes.   And even with Zen 4, the Fmax benefit from not using 3D V-cache using comparable skus was also only single digits anyways.",Neutral
AMD,"Adamantium was always rumored to be an additional L4 cache IIRC, and what Intel appears to be doing with NVL is just adding more L3 (even though ig Intel is calling their old L3 the new L4 cache? lol).   I don't think Intel can also build out Foveros-Direct at scale just yet, considering they are having problems launching it for just CLF too.",Neutral
AMD,Zen6 is the last AMD CPU using its socket anyway,Neutral
AMD,"I'm an e-core hater but arrow lake e-cores are really performant and make up for the loss of HT. arl/nvl 4+8 would wildly beat 6c12t adl/rpl.  HT was always a fallacy anyway. If you load up every thread, your best possible performance is ~60% of a core for a games main-thread.  I would much rather pin main-thread to best p-core in a dedicated fashion and let the other cores handle sub threads. Much better 1% lows if we optimize for arrow lake properly (still doesn't hold a candle to 9800X3D with HT disabled though).",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, I somewhat agree with this. I suppose it depends if Intel’s latency problem with their P+E core design is at all a fixable one - 4c/8t is still shockingly serviceable for gaming, but 4c/4t absolutely is not.",Neutral
AMD,It's the same ratio as 285K 8P+16E vs AMD 16P and we know that 285K is competitive despite no hyperthreading,Neutral
AMD,"Sooo a few months ago, I helped a buddy of mine troubleshoot a black screen issue on his newly built 9800X3D and RTX 5090 rig, a fairly common issue with Nvidia’s latest GPUs.  While working on his PC, I'd notice a series of odd and random hiccups. For example, double clicking a window to maximize it would cause micro freezes. His monitor runs at 240Hz, and the cursor moves very smoothly, but dragging a window around felt like it was refreshing at 60Hz. Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.  I did my due diligence on his AMD setup: updated the BIOS and chipset drivers, enabled EXPO profile, made sure Game Bar was enabled, set the power mode to Balanced. Basically, all the little things you need to do to get the X3D chip to play nice and left.  But man... I do not want to ever be on an AMD system.",Neutral
AMD,did they measure responsiveness and timed the click to action? and was it significantly different? how much difference are we talking about?,Neutral
AMD,"can you explain exactly what you're talking about here? are you talking about a situation where the system needs to do random reads from an ssd? aka: boot time, initial game load time?",Neutral
AMD,"How was ""system snappiness"" measured?",Neutral
AMD,No.,Neutral
AMD,"Now both AMD and Intel chips are “disaggregated “ which means between cpu and other agents like memory controllers, pcie, and storage there is higher latency than the 12/13/14th gen parts. AMD has higher latency due to the larger distances involved on the package.  Also Intel is not really improving the CPU core much. There won’t be a compelling reason to upgrade from a 14700 until DDR6 comes out. At least not in desktop. Nova lake high cache parts will cost $600 or more so value/dollar will be low.",Negative
AMD,So? Major upgrade for everything else,Neutral
AMD,"I had an 12600 not k. I had the opposite experience, I upgraded to a 7800x3d and the snappiness was a night and day upgrade. I can recommend a x3d to anyone. Pair that cpu with Windows 11 IoT LTSC and you have a winner <3",Positive
AMD,"Meant to say ""Gaming Performance""  >Higher avg on X3D  >similar or same 1% lows on both platforms >Higher .1% lows on Intel.",Neutral
AMD,"any comment that starts with ""I mean..""  I never go any further, its like some weird reddit think where everyone with ignorant comments seems to start out with this,  at least often anyway.",Negative
AMD,"""Enthusiast Segment"" my good sir. All the benches you see are poorly configured or stock 14900K. With tuning it's a different story. Intel craptorlake scales with fast ram.",Neutral
AMD,"As a long time AMD user I know that Intel needs to be tuned to perform best. So when you tune the 14900K or even 285K you get like 20% performance uplift vs stock. X3D just performs great out of the box because of the huge L3 Cache. At the very least if you do not like microstutters or frame drops and want consistent gaming performance Intel 14th gen is superior vs current AMD's offering. Anyone with a specific board like Apex, Lightning, Tachyon, or even Gigabyte Refresh boards + i7/i9 13-14th gen with decent memory controller can achieve similar gaming experience. I'm speaking from experience since I also have a fully tuned 9950x3D/5090 on my testbench. For productivity task Intel feels much better to use as well. I feel like Intel is just better optimized for Windows and Productivity too.",Positive
AMD,"Actually Intel thermal is already better than Amd ever since Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake released. Even Core Ultra 7 258V is arround 10c cooler than Amd Z2E and Strix Point on the same watt.   On MSI Claw 8 AI+, Lunar Lake temp at 20w is just arround 62c while the Amd version is arround 70c. I wouldn't have a doubt Nova Lake and Panther Lake will also have good thermal because it will have 18A node with BPD and RibbonFET GAA which is more advance than traditional silicon when it comes to power delivery and efficiency.",Positive
AMD,Ah so bLLC on both tiles is a possible configuration? Any chance Intel actually goes for this?,Neutral
AMD,You can very simply get 9800x3D to 5.4 with little effort,Neutral
AMD,"No, they will do zen7 too",Neutral
AMD,I haven't seen any of those issues on AMD where the underlying cause wouldn't also cause those issues on Intel.,Negative
AMD,"7800x3d here and never had these issues, came from intel",Neutral
AMD,Difference between 85MBps and 140MBps in q1t1 random reads and writes.,Neutral

AMD,So what configuration (tuning and ram settings) can a 14900k match a 9800x3d?,Neutral
AMD,That (Apple Silicon is good) and UMA are different stories I already know that Apple Silicon is good,Positive
AMD,On which benchmark(s) / metrics?,Neutral
AMD,"Haven't kept up with mobile since AMD 5000 and intel 10th gen, all I remember is intel needing XTU undervolting and then intel blocking XTU so using third party undervolt programs, AMD like I said 5000 never needed undervolting.   Desktop side, AMD 7000 is a hot mess, like seriously ridiculous. Seems that was sorted on 9000,    Let's wait and see on nova lake and zen6, like I said, brand loyalty is stupid, bought into AM5, so it's cheaper for me to go for zen6 with 244Mb of L3, but no am6-7 that will be intel.",Negative
AMD,"In theory, yes. For packaging reasons and market segmentation, probably not.",Neutral
AMD,"what's that on in terms of percentage, or seconds to person? was it noticeable?  i'm not techy enough, but is random reads and writes for clicking things and accessing data, and less so on copying and pasting a file?",Neutral
AMD,where is this whitepaper,Neutral
AMD,"You can send white papers all day but if most people buy these for gaming or productivity, AMD is winning in both categories.",Neutral
AMD,Stock clocks 5.7/4.4/5.0 HT Off With DDR5 7600-8000 on Windows 10 22H2 or Windows 11 23H2 is enough to match 9800x3D at 5.4ghz with 6000 c28/6200 c28,Neutral
AMD,So MLID leaked in his most recent video about this (and he ranks it with a blue color code - 'very high confidence')  What do you think about this?,Neutral
AMD,[https://youtu.be/0dOjvdOOq04?t=283](https://youtu.be/0dOjvdOOq04?t=283) This explains it.  Gonna find the whitepapers link again.,Neutral
AMD,Based on what evidence?   I looked online for a few moments and found:  (1) Buildzoid from actually hardcore  overlocking did a 12 hour live stream where they couldn't even get a 8000 mhz overclock stable on the 14900k. No wonder why people haven't benched this lol  https://www.youtube.com/live/bCis9x_2IL0?si=ht3obVoBLcRFCyXI  (2) Plenty of benchmarks where an overclocked 9800x3d is about 10 percent faster than an overclocked 14900k with 7600 ddr5,Neutral
AMD,"Haven't you been listening? The conversation is strange (Confused) You first brought up the story of UMA, right?",Neutral
AMD,"Be civil and follow Reddiquette, uncivil language, slurs and insults will result in a ban.",Neutral
AMD,"That channel has a lot of videos and even on this specific video it would help if you point the specific time you're referring to.  Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.  So by virtue of their fast memory Macs are easily 3x to 8x faster than PC on LLMs.  The rest is quite different though which is why what benchmark is important.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm highly suspicious, for packaging reasons if nothing else. I'm not going to call it impossible, but that would put enormous strain on the X dimension. Think about it, it's something on the order of 3-4x what the socket was originally for.  And obviously goes without saying, but MLID ""very high confidence"" doesn't mean shit.",Negative
AMD,"Based on my own testing , the games I play and benchmark results. Bullzoid is not relevant to this conversation. You can keep downvoting me for speaking the truth it's okay. I can't blame you because youtube and mainstream techspot are 99% misinformation. If you believe 9800x3D is 30% faster then go buy it, nobody is stopping you. I have investments with AMD and you're doing me a favor by supporting them.",Neutral
AMD,Just to be clear compute and hardware support for things like tensor cores have a massive impact. HBM is king but on older cards like the mi100 (released five years ago) can be out paced by a mid range card like the 4070.  All I wanted to convey is llm and token generation is a complex topic with limitations and struggles beyond memory bandwidth.,Neutral
AMD,"I haven't downvoted you at all, what are you even talking about.   You want people to believe in some conspiracy theory where any other information is a lie, and only you provide the ""real truth"".",Negative
AMD,"Besides, UMA wasn't first developed by Apple. Even if Intel introduces it, the software side or the software framework… Moreover, the OS side has to deal with it, so it is necessary to consider it a little. That's what you said earlier",Neutral
AMD,"I take no side there. I'm a dev, I want my code to be the fastest on all platforms  I have: - M4 Max so I can optimize on ARM and MacOS - Ryzen 9950X so I can optimize with AVX512 - in the process of buying an Intel 265K so I can tune multithreaded code to heterogeneous architecture.  The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough. So I expect the next-gen CPUs (Zen 6 and Nova Lake) to be quad-channel by default (~200GB/s with DDR5) so they are at least in the same ballpark as M4 chip (but still 2x slower than M4 Pro and Max).  I also expect more soldered LPDDR5 builds in the coming year.",Neutral
AMD,"Have you not seen HardwareUnboxed 9070 XT Finewine video? Tell me why should I trust someone like that? I'm just sayin if you want real information test it yourself. I just don't trust product influencers like GamersNexus, HUB , Jayz2cents and other mainstream channels. Id rather buy the product and test it myself. Im not forcing you to believe what I said, its for people that actually knows what Raptorlake is capable off. If you want to see a properly tuned 14900k check out facegamefps on youtube. This is a very capable platform.",Neutral
