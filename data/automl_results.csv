Intel,"so the A, B, C, (etc) Series is just branding? and they dont think they have enough performance improvement in Xe3 to warrant a jump to a new branding name? … but Xe3 plus will be enough to call it C series.",Neutral
Intel,"I loved how Tom Peterson did the circuit of tech blogs, tubers, and related last Fall to announce and advocate for ARC Battlemage.  Looking forward to seeing alot of him over the next few months for Xe3 and ARC C-series",Positive
Intel,Everything about Celestial I've heard seems to be regarding mobile. Is there actually going to be dedicated discrete graphics?,Neutral
Intel,The Intel driver downloading a shader cache for games from Intel sounds very noteworthy.   I'm really skeptical tying GPU drivers to a manufacturer's online service.,Neutral
Intel,"They don't care. These will be mid tier chips at best. The RTX IGPU ones will be their flagships. These are still damn impressive though, just have to make that clear.",Negative
Intel,"The mega brains of this community really struggle with product naming lol, its so funny to watch supposed intelligent people straight faced say they can't work out what product out 6 to buy because of their product names, most of them are in different market segments so you can't even accidentally buy the wrong one.",Negative
Intel,"They may divide ABC depending on ISA/hardware capabilities used for example. Like AMD used ""RDNA 3.5"" on mobile as full RDNA 4 would pull more power due to more silicon dedicated to AI (including FSR 4 -\_-). RDNA 3.5 has a lot of ISA and part of hardware changes that went into RDNA 4. So Xe 3B will be better than current but Xe 3C will do better at DXR and/or AI frame gen/whatever new tech they added.",Neutral
Intel,"This will help you to understand: https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/intels-xe3-graphics-architecture-breaks-cover-panther-lakes-12-xe-core-igpu-promises-50-percent-better-performance-than-lunar-lake  This is not brand new architecture, it's refinement on battlemage to work more efficiently. Thinks of it as Xe2.5 but for some reason marketing is calling it Xe3.",Positive
Intel,">they dont think they have enough performance improvement in Xe3 to warrant a jump to a new branding name?      No what he said is that the Arc B Series hasn't been around for all that long and the B580 has garnered a very positive reception so they felt in terms of branding and marketing moving in Panther Lakes Xe³ into the B series brand is a better marketing move than throwing away the B series branding and starting the C series branding now. In others words they want Panther Lake to ride on the momentum and positive vibes the B series branding has garnered.   Xe³ is a Xe³ based architecture like Xe³P is architecturally but there is more to selling a product than the engineering, keep in mind there's strong rumors that there will be a B770 launch, Intel also just released the B60 and later this year will provide a big software expansion to Bxx cards so the B series brand is still full of life. Xe³P will launch much later and at that point Intel feels there will have passed enough time to leave the B series branding behind.",Neutral
Intel,An alternative explanation could also be that Celestial dGPUs *are* launching as Xe3P and they would want the launch of C series iGPU and dGPU to be around the same time and the same architecture.,Neutral
Intel,">so the A, B, C, (etc) Series is just branding?  Wasnt it always so? Xe is the architectural names, ABC was just branding for customers.",Neutral
Intel,"No public announcements yet, but logically it would make all the sense for Intel to launch them, and do so in larger quantities so people in the market can get them at MSRP. Battlemage proved there is a lot more demand than there was supply, and it'd take too long to ramp it up once it became clear they were received well. With proof of a market test pass, they've now got a chance to do it right.  They are excellent value products that would allow Intel to get a chunk of that market, given they are available in sufficient quantities at intended price points.",Positive
Intel,Is shader caching on first use a real problem? Sounds like bored people needing something to cry about again.,Negative
Intel,>RDNA 3.5 has a lot of ISA and part of hardware changes that went into RDNA 4  Do you have a source for this? I vaguely remember 3.5 wasn't really bringing particular changes,Neutral
Intel,That's exactly what everyone's new GPU generation is.  An entirely new architecture is extremely rare for any company.,Neutral
Intel,That's not what Peterson was talking about context wise when he addressed this in the video.,Negative
Intel,"They would be extremely stupid not to continue to release discrete graphics cards, even if they decide to release 2-3 gaming SKUs per new generation; entry/budget, mid-range, high-end, etc.  - they win. until they keep iterating up, maturing driver, increasing install user base, improving software, until the point they can target higher segments (enthusiast tier)  Gaming GPUs remain the flagship component that pushes the limits of silicon design, features like ray tracing, AI upscaling, and real time path racing all debut in gaming before trickling into pro and AI workloads. Every research report shows that demand for high-end GPUs is still strong. Steam HW survey shows the most popular GPUs are still mid-range gaming cards, showing that discrete GPUs remain central to the PC ecosystem.  And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",Neutral

Intel,"There are more to that, if you look at RDNA 4 and blackwell for example they had changes to the SMs, enc/dec, etc.   Here it using basically the same cores, but changes are made to better utilize those cores. I think this sentence summarize it the best:  ""Intel classifies Xe3 GPUs as part of the Battlemage family because the capabilities the chip presents to software are similar to those of existing Xe2 products"".  Now I'm not saying it's a bad thing, Intel has a lot of inefficiencies with Battlemage, a lot of time you expect it perform better judging by the amount of hardware. By going this route the basically giving pretty good improvement only year after initial release with basically almost the same drivers. It's just not a new generation but something in the middle between a refresh and a new generation.",Neutral
Intel,"Not rare, but more like it only happens when there's a paradigm shift in graphics that necessitates it.   GCN -> RDNA or Pascal -> Ampere are the most recent ones.",Neutral
Intel,"its not extremely rare. It happens once every 7-10 years or so when they redesign it for significant changes. but yeah, most generations will be refinement.",Neutral
Intel,"In the end it is all matter of marketing, filter it for a moment and understand what it's. As he said ""leverage all the good work from battlemage"". As I read it and looking the architecture it's battlemage with some enhancement that will come to future product celestial. Something like RDNA 3.5. I think they messed up the naming - they want to present it as something new and different (it's in some aspects) but it's not the real next gen in their roadmap.",Neutral
Intel,By discrete iam assuming you mean client graphics SoCs? The margins are not enough on those - you make much more money on Pro cards/ HPC.,Negative
Intel,"No this is not the case. The decision is purely branding. Xe3 and Xe3P are part of the same generation architecture wise unlike Xe2 and Battlemage, he addressed this.",Neutral
Intel,It's this. IGPU's will be for gamers and DGPU for data center. They basically both have said this :) People just don't notice anything. What do folks think RTX IGPU's on intel chips are gonna be for. LIKE LOL!,Neutral
Intel,"Then why he said ""when we move to our next architecture...""? Meaning they are not the same (Xe3 and Xe3P), also look at the slide they're grouping Xe2 with Xe3 under battlemage.  What you say contradicts their statements, and the article. The decision is of course marketing but nowhere they say Xe3 and Xe3P share the same architecture. This is why I said before it should've been called Xe2.5 or something of that sort like with RDNA 3.5.",Neutral
Intel,Next architecture is just rearrangement of existing cores into more effective set up. No contradictions.,Neutral
Intel,"When we will see deep dive into X3P celestial we will see what have changed. Until then it's just speculation of the differences between Xe3 and Xe3P. My bet there will be more changes than mere ""rearrangement of existing cores"".",Neutral
Intel,"Love a good TAP interview, hopefully he'll do some podcasts too once the embargo lifts.",Positive

Intel,"Tom's an absolute gem. It's so frustrating to see the most passionate and effective communicators locked up behind embargoes and NDAs, so fingers crossed that this marks the next wave of tech exploration and deep dives. Always nice to see him pop up in a random GN or PC World video.  Credit where it's due, Lex (Alejandro) has also always been attentive and forthcoming in his Reddit interactions, even factoring in the usual embargo/NDA constraints.

Intel,Igpus not discrete gpus,Neutral
Intel,"I would not attempt to read much into claims like that. This is marketing, not an investment roadmap. I'm sure if you pressed them on it, the lawyers would have some words.   Remember, they've yet to even *talk* about dGPUs past BMG. And the big-iGPU NVL is reportedly cancelled (likely in favor of the Nvidia partnership).",Negative
Intel,Hahaha I can hear Tom saying “fucking Tom Peterson has been *lying* to you” as you say that,Negative
Intel,Problem is we don't know the real roadmap is for Intel. I really want them to put out a roadmap like they used to. But things in flux probably :s.,Negative
Intel,I think only way for intel to enter consumer GPU space is to start via iGPU at this point.  They just need to make bigger faster iGPU to make Nvidia RTX xx50/RTX xx60 redundant.,Neutral
Intel,I don't think partnership Nvidia iGPUs will be ready until TTL/HML circa 2029/2030.,Neutral
Intel,"Agreed, but then similarly I would also not attempt to conjecture on their roadmap outside of an investment roadmap... lack of a public roadmap update on graphics in a while is certainly saying something by not saying anything, but it's also not saying cancellations, etc...",Negative
Intel,There are just too many Toms in tech media. Tom of Moore's Law is Dead needs to thin out the competition.,Negative
Intel,I don't think even Intel knows what the real roadmap is anymore. They're so far behind on the previous ones that it's not surprising that they're not releasing new ones.,Negative

Intel,"You think Intel is going to maintain these footholds any longer than they would need to?  This push of their dedicated GPUs into the professional space, is just a mere attempt to get rid of the unsold inventory of ARC-GPUs at the highest possible price-tag right from the beginning – Dumping those into the enterprise- and datacenter-space, in noble hope that someone clueless might bite upon the Intel-brand, and then dip into it at high costs *at non-existing support software-support* Intel pretends to deliver some time in the future.

Intel,"Even the fancy NVIDIA interconnects are a bottleneck for training performance, as are the memory bandwidth and even L2 bandwidth. One architects the algorithm around that. A tighter bottleneck is obviously not ideal, but it might still make sense depending on the price of the hardware.  As long as a copy of the full model and optimization state fits on the 24GB bank the PCI-E interconnect isn't really too limiting for training. Small models, like a 1B parameters voice model, will naturally fit.

Do you actually think, that Intel is that stupid to plain announce the death of ARC-series graphics-cards? Do you think they'd even sell a hundreds cards after such a announcement? Who would by a dead-end line of graphics-cards, which won't even get any further driver-support and still have disastrous drivers like Intel's ARC? NO-ONE!  Of course they virtue signal it through the backdoor here, to preserve the sell-off the of the rest of pile of shame of their B-series graphics-cards as long as possible (leaving users with none support afterwards), and *only then* pull the plug afterwards when they went through their inventory …  Since when are you following Intel? Intel has always done so, and only announced a sudden discontinuation once the inventory was sold (leaving customers in the open with no further support overnight), despite virtue signalling a continuation all the time (to preserve a proper sell-off).  ---- Wasn't this exactly the same story with **Optane** back then? Each and every question upon a future support was answered in the affirmative, only to pull the plug overnight again as usual …  I'm not another piracy of cons here, it's Intel pulling the same Optane-stunt with ARC – Happily selling off their cards, knowing darn well, that they will pull the plug, yet refuse to actually play with open cards again.",Negative

Space Marine is still struggling, Spider man 1 is running great, SpiderMan 2 does not.  Drivers are constantly improving, HUB has bright outlook. The bigger issue is 9060XT8 within 10-15% price range, but delivering 30% better perf.     Edit: A lot of people talking about how old or slow 2600 is in replies. And that's part of the point, I obviously didn't get across well. The issue is not the absolute performance, but the relative loss compared to AMD. In CPU bound scenarios they both should be close, since the limiting factor is CPU. But in this scenario 9060XT is even further ahead than when they are unconstrained.",Neutral

Look at what optiscaler is doing, we could have had an open standard for upscalers that FSR XESS and DLSS could have been built on top of meaning much wider support across games instead of every game needing specific implementation and leaving us with outdated upscalers that we need driver overrides and DLL swaps to get around.  Microsoft is only now working on a directX based upscaler API that solves this problem. We should have had something like that years ago like we did for RT.",Negative
Intel,"I mean, surely it depends on when they have to share it. If they can release with the feature exclusively first, but then have to share at or after release, then it can still help the current generation of their cards until it's time for the new gen.",Neutral
Intel,"It makes adoption slower though. Especially for smaller devs and the smaller graphics vendors. Even now with pretty large games we still have software lumen only. If RT was pushed as an open standard earlier we might actually have more games and better implementation across the whole market, not just nvidias pet projects.",Negative
Intel,"DirectStorage 1.1 (the actually usable version unlike 1.0) was supported by Windows 9 months after PS5 release. They werent that far behind on that, noone just was interested.",Neutral

Intel,Nvidia controls 90% of the discrete GPU market on PC.   Anything proprietary that they make essentially becomes the standard going forward.,Neutral
Intel,"Huh?  1. RT in games is now done through DirectX APIs, which are vendor agnostic.   2. For GPU features, NVIDIA usually introduces them through a DirectX standard, they are just usually the first vendors to support it until others catch up.   3. RT is limited because current gen consoles are not good at RT. AMD took multiple years to adopt RT or AI acceleration cores.",Neutral
Intel,I actually have not seen an open source or even cross vendor solution with any reasonably quick uptake. Its a theoretical myth at the moment,Negative
Intel,the issue with RT isnt standard. Its that consoles/amdGPUs simply didnt support it for away too long.,Negative
Intel,"...It's down to 15 now? I thought it was 20.   Although. Software is more copyright than patent anyway, and copyright is, like, 70 years after the author dies, or 95 after publication for corporate works.",Neutral
Intel,"> RT in games is now done through DirectX APIs, which are vendor agnostic.  Now being the key word, Nvidia launched their RTX before DXR was even available.  AMD's slow adoption is absolutely one of the problems which might not have not been so delayed if AMD, Nvidia, console makers and Microsoft worked on RT together from the start.   This is all just musing really. Maybe nvidia did us all a favour by breaking the mold forcing everyone else to play catch up.",Neutral
Intel,"Depends on country/industry. Copyright also depends on country, but for most civilized word its authors death + 95 years (thanks disney). Copyright however has many exceptions to it, well, at least in the west. In Japan it does not and technically you can get sued for saying Zelda is fun because you broke copyright by saying Zelda without permission. Its why Nintendo is able to get switch reviews removed from youtube.",Neutral
Intel,The DirectX RT spec and SDK came out in 2018. The blame lies entirely on AMD. Imagine Nvidia waiting for AMD to agree,Negative
Intel,I would imagine intel has to at least get celestial out the door before cutting off their GPU line. it's been so long in development that it would be more of a waste of money to cancel it then finish it and see how it sells. at least getting it to the public means some kind of ROI and a solid position in the lower end of the GPU market that AMD and Nvidia are abandoning to the used market.,Negative

Intel,They barely lived on before the deal.,Neutral
Intel,"It'll live on our hearts, yes.",Positive
Intel,Lol if you believe that I have a bridge to sell you in Brooklyn,Neutral
Intel,"You have to look at this from both sides.  This would give NVidia the ability to offer OEMs a tightly integrated on SOC gfx solution vs a separate discrete gfx package as it is now. This would lower costs for NVidia's customers as well as improve performance and Intel's cpu's get to ride that train.   Intel has a long track record of using integrated gfx so it's certainly right up their alley to take this on.  Could Xe gfx coexist with NVidia? Yep, I think so.  Xe could be the budget igfx option and iNVidia is the premium integrated solution. That's basically how it is now with Intel Arc/Battlemage & GTX.   On the DC side, Intel has absolutely no gfx solution at this time and won't have anything for at least two years.  Intel already sells NVidia when a gfx solutions are needed so tighter integrated products will benefit both sides in that DC space as well.",Positive
Intel,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work. And even if NVIDIA wants to keep Intel's fabs open, I doubt they want to run them either.",Neutral

Intel,"Im not sure what you are implying, but nvidia partnerships have historically not broken from their side as far as I know.   Apple gave them the boot, not the other way around.   AMD are the ones who rejected the Nvidia-AMD merger back in 2005.   Tesla kicked nvidia out as well, because they did not want to keep paying them to develop the tech.   If you are referring to AIB Partners, then that can hardly be called an actual partnership. That's more of a contracted labor and distribution agreement. Even then, XFX only got blacklisted because they were a premier partner who were seen as jumping ship when the going got a little rough with nvidia stalling between 2009-2010.",Neutral

Intel,There is a reason why every nvidia partnership ends up breaking apart pretty quickly...,Negative
Intel,"Nvidia seems to make working with Nvidia too difficult for their partners to continue. It's the business version of someone emotionally bailing, and abusing you until you leave them.  They did that with smartphones, consoles, Linux, Apple, and likely countless other projects I didn't follow in as much detail.",Negative
Intel,"That really is up for debate. That they are losing money on them when you account for RNE and RnD amortized by unit, sure. That I have no doubt about.  But that is not the same thing as losing money on each card sold based solely on the bill of materials and distribution cost etc. Which is what actually matters when looking at if a product is ""sold at a loss"" or not.",Negative
Intel,"Hardly. Even after the bubble, Intel needs in house GPU, for both APUs and data center... which means they'll make a gaming version if the work is already mostly there.",Neutral
Intel,"In the case of Intel and Nvidia chipsets, it was Intel that decidedly ended the relationship, paying Nvidia off to exit the chipset business so that they could make integrated graphics.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, if nVidia has an Achilles' heel, it's their company culture's near total inability to do semicustom without fuckery, and it's the reason AMD dominates basically every high performance gaming graphics application outside of Windows desktops and laptops.",Negative
Intel,Well yes. But you do need to amortize the tape out and dev. costs over the production life cycle of the product. And with low volumes I'm not even sure AMD is accomplishing that. AMD is saved due to the console business funding dGPU tech development.,Neutral
Intel,"They've already cancelled every data centre GPU after Ponte Vecchio (which was forced out by DOE contract) despite reassuring us Rialto Bridge and Falcon Shore were on track as little as months before the chop, and their next is apparently Jagure Shore in 2028.

Might not be much, but it beats not selling them.  They might still be ""losing"" money on them when all costs are included. But it would still make sense to make more of them and sell them, since each one sold still plugs that black hole of externalized costs. And would not be the reason for lack of availability.",Neutral

Intel,"Xe will live in Desktops and high end HX which uses the same chips. Xe3 is done. Xe4 is probably done too. So i expect them to be used here like HD Graphics and will get very little improvements from Xe5 onwards. Just to keep display and needed functions.  In a way they are still commited to GPUs   H, U and V are almost certainly getting their Arc GPUs replaced with RTX ones.  We all know with RTX tech those Laptop CPUs will sell a whole lot more and make intel way more profit. Anything with Nvidia's tech sells like pancakes now.  So going forward they can't recover Xe development costs through the laptop iGPUs using like they did before. Remember laptop iGPUs are the highest volume ARC sales.  Without those sale it's hard to justify full on Xe spending needed for dGPUs. Especially with Intel's financial situation.",Neutral
Intel,"This deal seems crazy.  For Nvidia that's an easy way to get custom x86 CPUs for datacenters and a way to directly compete with Strix Halo tier products.   If the products suck they can just blame Intel and walk out as if nothing ever happened. They don't really have much to lose here.  Even if they cancel their own CPU cores as a result of this deal, they can still use stock ARM cores in the future when/if the partnership ends...  But for Intel? For Intel this seems like a complete nightmare.  What did it take for them to convince Nvidia? It's hard to believe this won't have any impact on Arc... In the worse case scenario they'll be giving up on high-end graphics, just for Nvidia to abandon them right after when x86 isn't as important anymore...  This sounds like a desperate gamble, and it's difficult to understand where it came from because Intel does have pretty good iGPUs... Why are they so desperate?",Negative

Intel,Intel has struggled with GPU for decades which is insane when look what Apple has accomplished with their iGPUs.

Intel,There are definitely more Intel ARC iGPU users than Arc GPU users. This will lead to a cut in workforce (already happened) and more in the future. This also means less investment into things like XeSS.,Negative
Intel,The thing is that Intel barely sells any dedicated ARC cards. Almost all of their graphics userbase comes from Intel integrated graphics with their new XE tiles on them.

Like, the volume for both ""launches"" is supposed to be low, actual devices probably won't be available to purchase until the next year, but. Companies are supposed to be receiving samples of Panther Lake. Now. Presently.   For them to say their roadmap isn't affected, isn't changed at all. Unless that's a massive lie, that's only possible if samples of integrated Xe3 have already been fabbed, are already in working silicon.   ...Like, not to get too into the rumor mill, but supposedly the early Panther Lake samples aren't doing great. The CPU side isn't very efficient compared to Lunar Lake, and the GPUs sometimes don't work. But, when they do work, supposedly, the performance is really good, and, again, rumors, but the problem is supposedly more about Intel's drivers than the hardware or architecture itself.   ...I can completely believe that Intel would panic and would rather kill their GPU division entirely than. Invest in their software stack. Developing good technology and then abandoning it instead of advancing, because abandoning it is cheaper and easier is an extremely Intel move.   But if nothing else, the sunk costs for Xe3 at least make me feel like. They sorta have to figure it out, if only because they don't have time to replace it with NVIDIA, in the time frame Panther Lake has to come out.",Neutral
Intel,"There is just simply no way Intel is going to rely on Nvidia as the sole supplier of their iGPUs when their product lines.

Intel,"I think client inference is kind of stupid. It's limited in capability by your local memory amount, and it's economically inefficient because you can't batch requests.  No AI system that exists is ""there"" yet, all of them can be improved enough that people would switch over to a better one. The current top of the line commercial models are hundreds of GB for the weights. To use client inference today you need to use a severely castrated model. Alternatively, if you ship all those hundreds of GB of DRAM on every device, they will be very inefficiently utilized because a single user rarely has the token flow to keep them working, and when they do it's all serial so you can't even batch, you just have to do a linear read over the whole model to get a single token out. And when there's an improved model next year that takes twice the ram you have to roll out whole new machines to the whole fleet.  In contrast, centralized inference can fit as much memory as you put on it, there are no power constraints, you can batch hundreds of requests in one go, and you can update the whole system much more easily. Client inference won't even win in latency because even though you have to pay for network latency, the centralized solution is probably much faster.  The only real advantage client inference has is privacy, and that's not a problem in business, they just get their own inference server. For office work, that even makes latency very fast.",Negative

Now the Intel+RTX looks more expensive right by costing 25%? WRONG   Cause if the two laptops are built with exact same components and Intel+ARC laptop costs $1000, the Intel+RTX laptop would cost $1100.  Suddenly the Intel+RTX becomes the obvious choice at only just 10% more money.  It gets worse the higher you. $1500 intel+arc v $1600 Inte+rtx. Or $2000 v $2100  This is also why AMD sucks at OEM and Prebuilts  If a 9060xt built desktop costs $900 the equivalent RTX 5060 Ti desktop would just cost $970.

Nvidia's and AMD's cards outperform it in gaming raster performance thanks to having been in the market for much longer. They have the more efficient architecture and software for gaming. It wouldn't be great for marketing if Arc came out at the same time with similar pricing, yet got beaten in the FPS benchmarks.  But productivity cards could wait. Arc's always been very competitive in productivity tasks. Maybe because Intel has more experience in this department. So reliable driver is the focus here.",Positive
Intel,">Only if your marketing plan is to sell 0 gpus because who will buy gpu with bad driver and application support?  Good driver and application support is not possible to deliver without a significant install base of your product in the wild. PC configurations vary wildly and usually driver issues are about some bad luck combination of hardware, driver versions, and application versions.  The incumbency advantage in this market is immense.

Intel,"It's a really good general purpose card. Perhaps not the best card if you want to squeeze out the most fps out of games, but it performs really well in a wide range of tasks including gaming. And yes 12GB VRAM really comes in handy.  It can easily be found for under $250. B580 is still cheaper than 5060 and 9060 XT and even RTX 5050 and RX 7600, especially in the UK where you can find a B570 for only 20 pounds more than RTX 3050. That's way cheaper than RX 6600, it's a no brainer. But the prices could only go down thanks to economy of scale mostly. It's been produced for a while, that's why.  Also one of the big reasons it's still selling now is thanks to good publicity. Imagine if it came out as the same time as RX 9060 XT. HWU would tear a new hole regardless of how much of an improvement it is over the Alchemist cards and the impressive productivity performance.

Intel,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction. Very important when running 24-48 hour simulations.",Neutral

AMD's SR-IOV offerings are [very limited](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#virtualization-support), [And Nvidia has a bigger selection](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/gpus-supported-by-vgpu.html) but their budget VGPU options are being phased out (P40).  I believe VDI is Microsoft's implementation. I believe I've done VDI on my RTX 2070 before (I have done seamless sharing between host and VM), but I don't know if it's possible with AMD. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm more familiar with the Linux side / vGPU than VDI.  ECC is Error Correcting RAM. I generally don't understand the use case for ECC either, but it is ubiquitous in HPC. All server boards support ECC RAM.  In modern environments most of these features need 16GB of VRAM minimum, but if you ever wanted to try it on a consumer card, you could get an old RTX 20 series and try it out with some driver mods. Optionally, the P40 is still pretty cheap ($250 used) and doesn't need those hacks at the cost of drawing a lot of power, which Intel has solved with their Battlemage Pro platform (by far the cheapest VRAM/$/W you can get).",Neutral

Intel,"It's needed whenever the work you're doing matters and a single-bit error could cause significant harm.  Something like audio or video, a single-bit error probably isn't very noticeable.  Calculations, it absolutely depends on what you're calculating and which bit gets flipped; flipping the low-order bit in a number might not matter much and flipping the high-order bit could cause a big error.  Networking, it depends on whether the protocols you use have more error checks at a higher level (TCP does; UDP does not).

Intel,"The problem with Gaudi (I know, I've written code and run training runs on it) is simply that the programming model is not oneAPI, or whatever oneAPI becomes. Yes, pytorch works, but people care a lot about software longevity and long term vision when buying $5mm+ of GPUs (and these are the purchases Intel cares about that can actually start to offset the cost of development).   The whole purpose behind Falcon Shores (and now Jaguar Shores, if it will even happen) is to put Gaudi performance (i.e. tensor cores) in an Xe-HPC package. Unifying graphics and compute packages is what NVIDIA was able to achieve but not yet AMD, and it's really great for encouraging ML development in oneAPI.

Obviously fixed pass though is an option, but even that isn't without issue. NVIDIA only recently removed the driver restriction, they could add it back at any time.

Intel,"LMAO, I actually have quite a bit of knowledge in this area.  If all you care for is VDI for a small number of VMs, then you'd go GPU passthrough. vGPU / MxGPU often requires higher levels of hypervisor software tier (i.e. VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus), requiring more money. For KVM hosts, setting up vGPU is a lot more difficult and time consuming than just straight up GPU passthrough.  Only two groups of people would be interested in GPU virtualization / splitting:  * Enterprise, in which they wouldn't care about the used card prices.  * Enthusiasts, in which they wouldn't want to pay for vGPU prices anyway. So why bother catering to this crowd?",Neutral
Intel,"Full GPU passthrough is not a solution that many people would consider because it is clumsier than using sr-iov (or potentially VirtIO GPU Venus). Plus for each extra passthrough instance I would have to add in another GPU and this greatly increases power consumption, heat output and cooling requirements. The process is not all that much more complicated at least on Turing GPUs with a hacked driver on KVM guests at least. Plus for passthrough, you probably still need an NVIDIA card because last I checked AMD cards still had a random kernel panic issue after being passed through.  My assumption is that sr-iov on the b50 will allow users an affordable way to have multiple guests on one host GPU without increasing power draw and paying for expensive alternatives and expensive vGPU subscriptions.",Negative
Intel,"...first time I heard people prefer SRIOV over GPU passthrough because it's ""clumsier"" lol. I'm sure setting up mdev devices in KVM, finding the correct corresponding GPU instances, making them persistent through reboot, then edit virsh xml for each individual VM is a lot easier than just doing IOMMU passthrough. /s     Again, enthusiasts don't care about power consumption / heat output / cooling requirements for their lab environment. Enterprise that do care about them are very willing to pay extra cost to get a production ready driver. You're creating a hypothetical situation that simply does not exist in the real world.",Neutral

They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown. As that can probably handle like another extra watt of heat and performance. Battery life is very nice, the fact that it can match other phones with like over 1000mAh bigger battery is funny. As people always flexing over how they have like a 4000, 5000mAh+ battery, of course having a bigger capacity is better, but the fact that Apple is more efficient with it and can have the same battery life at a much smaller battery speaks volumes about it.",Positive

After OMM and SER this seems like the third ""low hanging"" RT fruit optimization. Anyone serious about a PT GPU architecture NEEDs dynamic caching like Apple.

Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that. The base iPhone 17 looks like a reaaly reallly good option, more than ever, wished they didn't drop the Plus model. But man, I feel like waiting another year, hearing rumours about N2 and new packaging tech excites me.  That said, looking forward to QC, MT, and Samsung. SD8EG5 seems to be closing the gap, and that'll be very interesting tho those GB numbers don't tell things like power.",Positive

Intel,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.  Its either Qualcomm or Apple. AMD is too far behind Oryon and Apple's uarchs. They consume similar or even more area for their core architecture while lagging in performance while using significantly more power. The x86 ecosystem and compatibility is the only reason they'd survive Oryon.",Neutral

Intel,I can't wait to see die shots and measurements for these chips. The A18 Pro and A18 die shots were really interesting to see what was compacted or lost for the base model chip.

Cache isn't cheap for area and I'd also love to see inside the new E-cores and GPU.,Positive
Intel,">Growing the E core into a medium core is really important and something I was worried apple might miss out on, but this means they should be able to keep up in multicore as trends point to flooding CPUs with E cores.

I imagine the A19 Pro E core is fairly larger but the A18 E core was around 0.6/0.7mm2 in size. I'd imagine its not grown a whole lot.  >They really ~~buried~~ deleted the lede by not even mentioning the E core improvements beyond the cache and undersold the GPU.

That is, the A19 Pro on fp has skewed towards the flatter part of the perf / W curve.   >And I really doubt you'll be seeing 10W of ST power consumption on a phone. Geekerwan tests these things using Liquid Nitrogen. They are to test an SoC without restraints.  I agree it's rare, but why would Apple allow 10W? Were many workloads ***lacking*** fp performance that users prefer a bit less battery life for +9% fp perf vs the A18 Pro?  Of course, to most, battery life is more important, IMO, which is why core energy is most crucial, but missing here.  //  >An A19 Pro P core does seem to have increased performance at the same power by about 5%. Only P/W at peak has reduced. Which isn't even an issue when these phones would never reach that peak in daily use.  So the question becomes: do users want slightly better perf and 5% more power? On a phone, I'm of the opinion that power is paramount and should be forced to lower levels.",Neutral
Intel,">Aren’t they exactly the same p cores?  Definitely not. See the SPEC perf / GHz: A19 is nearly just the A18 Pro. Thus, this seems to be the final picture:  A19 Pro = new uarch, 32MB SLC, 12GB LPDDR5X-9600  A19 = binned OC of last year's A1**8** Pro, w/ faster LPDDR5X-8533, but smaller SLC (12MB)  New uArch clearly didn't pan out as expected in fp efficiency. A19 Pro may sit at a flatter part of the freq / power curve, A19 Pro may have more leakage, A19 Pro's [faster RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A19) may eat *a lot* power (Geekerwant tests mainboard power, not purely CPU power), etc.",Neutral

Intel,">I think AMD will have a hard time to win any efficiency crowns, but historically speaking they always had the peak ST performance on process node. Of course this is not as impressive because those are desktop chips which draw 100W+, and there have been historically gaps between desktop and laptop chips in ST for AMD (even though laptop technically had the TDP to sustain ST).  M2 and Zen 4 launched around the same period. The desktop chips score around 5-10% faster in Geekbench while using 20W per core power and 30-40W more for the I/O die. Taking the ST crown by a hair's width while using 5-10x more power isn't a win at all imo.",Neutral

Intel,"the shader re-ordering is different. (apple also do this).  Even with shader re-ordering you have the issue that you're still issuing 1000s of very small jobs.    GPUs cant do lots of small jobs, they are designed to do the same task to 1000s of pixels all at once.     If  you instead give them 1000 tasks were each pixel does something differnt the GPU cant run that all at the same time... in addition the overhead for setup and teardown of each of these adds even more void space between them.   So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",Neutral
Intel,"While RT does have lots of branching logic (and CPUs are much better at dealign with this) you also want to shader the result when a ray intercepts, and this is stuff GPUs are rather good at (if enough rays hit that martial)   We have had CPU RT for a long time and so long as you constrain the martial space a little GPUs these days, even with all the efficiency  loss are still better at it.   (there are still high end films that opt for final render on cpu as it gives them more flexibility in the shaders they use) but for a game were it is all about fudging it GPUs are orders of magnitude faster, you just have so much more fp compute throughput on the GPU even if it is running at 20% utilization that is still way faster than any cpu.",Positive
Intel,"Its not just useful for RT but also for a lot of other situations, being able to just call out to functions on the GPU and not pay a HUGE divergence penalty (you still pay some) opens up GPU compute to a load more cases were we currently might not bother.",Positive
Intel,I'm a bit confused. You think lagging 15% behind in P/W the competition for an entire year is not being a generation behind?  ARM themselves have managed only a 15% jump this year.

That was Apple's choice to upgrade to this faster memory.    Now, you're very right: we can't purely blame the uArch at Apple. It may well be the DRAM or the boost algorithms (like we saw at the A18 Pro launch last year) and—at Apple specifically—even the marketing overlords.

Intel,"While the efficiency for this is BAD, I dont think its 20W per core.  When we look at results by [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-zen4-zen4c-scaling/2) we can see \~7-8W per core for this (not great numbers, because its a weird chip and different node), which is still very bad. AMD certainly has some power issues, but many of which, i.e. inefficient I/O dies, are not really dependent on the CPU uArch and could switch at any moment. They certainly have much more inefficient chips at the moment than both Apple and Qualcomm. For Zen 6 we expect a major update to the desktop chiplet architectur which could bring some much needed improvements in terms of I/O though.  They have reasonably fast cores, and I think they are not in a terrible position, even though it is far from good. I think what is interesting for AMD to look out for is that they keep moving fast, instead of intel who didnt move fast since like 14nm, and AMD has strong cores. Additionally AMD has (including from the datacenter) an enterprise need to make the CPUs more efficient.  So yeah, very bad CPUs efficiency wise. A bit behind, but not terribly on perf per node wise, efficiency on the desktop is an afterthought for AMD, clearly, but they are moving constantly and are improving.

Intel,"At these small die sizes, yields can be really high. High enough that if they wanted to have supply for a 5050, they might not have enough GB206 dies that can be cut down to 20/36 SMs.  The 5060M is probably catching the bulk of the bottom-level GB206 dies at 26/36.  There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory. And I'd agree. But I'm sadly not anybody who can make that decision.  Personally, I can't wait to see what becomes of the cut-down GB207s. The 5050 is a ""golden"" fully-enabled die. There will be some with only 18, or 16, or even fewer working SMs. Hell it could lose an entire GPC and be down to half-working. Those will be some absolutely sad little GPUs.",Neutral

You can find those numbers on Gamer's nexus latest shrinkflation video on this topic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caU0RG0mNHg). Considering those things, the 5060 is essentially a 5050 and the 5050 is a 5030.  The GT 730 had 13.3% as many cores as the full GK110 die, with a 50W TDP.  The GT 1030 had around 10.3% as many cores as the full GP102 die, with a 30W TDP though this one was impressive.  The GXT 1630 had around 11% as many cores as full TU102 die, with exactly 75W TDP.  The RTX 5050 has 10.7% as many cores as the full GB202 die (RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell), and around 11.7% vs the 5090 (which is the number you'll se on Gamer's Nexus video, he rounds it up to 12%, I think that was a mistake on his part? I'm not gonna try and correct him though), but it has a TDP of 130W somehow, just 15W less than the 5060, that's absurd.  Hence why I'm saying it SHOULD be a sub 75W TDP card, and priced way below that. My theory is that it was OC'ed past its efficiency curve to make it at least moderately better than the 3060 and still be able to call it a XX50 card.",Neutral

Intel,"Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍 Doesn't matter if die sizes get bigger, that's up to Nvidia. Just because the halo product got bigger doesn't mean they can get away with moving their product stack (below the XX90) one tier up in prices.   I guess it is a dog shit methodology to use, only Gamer's Nexus uses it and I'm sure #1 Nvidia apologist u/Alive_Worth_2032 knows more than him.   It's a shit methodology to use if you love conformism and shrinkflation in GPUs, I agree.  And it's a shit methodology to use if you're an Nvidia executive.  If you can't see that Nvidia is putting all the effort into binning high end chips for AI cause it's 90% of their income, then I don't know what to tell you. Obviously it's a good move for them, and it works, but there's 0 reason for a gaming customer to defend them for it. We used to get much more out of their chips in the gaming cards for more reasonable prices, why's it wrong to want that?   You can't just draw a conclusion based on relative performance between 2 underpowered products, you compare them to the ""best"" Nvidia COULD give us (which is the full top die for each generation) and go down from there.  Edit: just look at the 3090/ti and how the chips were proportionally fine still compared to it and that die was 628mm^2. That's not even an excuse.",Neutral
Intel,"> It's a shit methodology to use if you love conformism and shrinkflation in GPUs, I agree. And it's a shit methodology to use if you're an Nvidia executive.  You can chose one methodology.   You can decide on comparing what hardware you get at a certain price point.   Or you can ignore price/bom and look only at arbitrary model numbers as if they mean something.  You cannot do both at the same time.  Personally I prefer to look at die area. The 5050 today is roughly comparable to the 1050 Ti, comparing it to the top cards that are not comparable is irrelevant.  Pascal did not have a analogue for the 5090, period.  >Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍  That changes nothing. The Pascal Titan are using the same die as the 1080 Ti. The whole tier of die that is used in today's consumer top SKUs and for the RTX 6000 Blackwell, DID NOT EXIST back then.  >Edit: just look at the 3090/ti and how the chips were proportionally fine still compared to it and that die was 628mm2. That's not even an excuse.  What are you even trying to say? Ampere also did not have a analogue to the 5090. The 3090 Ti, even it is sitting almost a tier below the 5090. The 2080 Ti and 5090 are unmatched in other generations.",Negative
Intel,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear. What I don't agree with is using the die area excuse to justify shrinkflation just because the 5090 is such a halo product.",Neutral
Intel,"> So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  Do you even listen to your own madness?  You realize that what you are saying. Is that the lower end 5000 series would be ""better"". If Nvidia removed the 5090 entirely. And renamed the 5080 the 5080 Ti, and made the 5070 Ti into the new 5080.  Suddenly, you would praise the lower end cards for being ""better"". Purely because the high end is less powerful. Nothing else changed, no one is getting more hardware for their money.  Jesus Christ the mental gymnastics you people go trough.   The hardware Nvidia gives you for your money, is all that matters.

Intel,"since you said you have enough money to get a PC, do that, treat yourself with a decent setup, it would be a million times better than playing on a laptop, especially the games you mentioned, if you can share your budget im sure we can figure out a good PC for those games, you won't need anything crazy i promise haha, all mid range pc combinations are able to run all those very well",Positive
Intel,"When it comes to pc game, there are so many variables.  Graphics setting, resolution, upscaling, genre of game and perceived smoothness of different FPS all contribute to how well a game run for you.  It is really hard to tell without trying.    For an integrated gpu, yours is by no means weak, but it still cannot compare to modern discrete gpu.  Generally, anything in or before ps4 era(i.e released before 2020 ) should run fine with minimum graphics setting at 1080p with fsr / xess upscaling. It should safely run at 30fps or above (i.e. as smooth or smoother than ps4 game)  Anything newer you will have to either watch benchmark on youtube, try the demo or benchmark tool of the game(some games offer this).  Steam also support refund of games played in less than 2 hours and purchased less than 2 weeks.  But don’t do that too much or you will be denied the refund.",Neutral

Intel,"I think personally you should build a pc! As long as your budget allows it you can get something for around 600 bucks on facebook marketplace, or you can build with used parts off of facebook marketplace.   If you want recommendations I’ll give you some:  Ryzen 5 5900x (180ish used)  RX6700xt (200ish bucks used)  Asus b450-f motherboard (50 - 100 bucks used)  32gb ddr4 ram whatever you’d like, probably Corsair though. (80-100ish)  PSU 650W (something reputable like Corsair) (90 bucks)  You can find good air coolers for the cpu for under 50 bucks just do research.   You’re looking at 680 bucks on the high end but definitely can find parts to fit a cheaper budget. Feel free to message me and I’d be glad to help you find something.  Edit: this is what you should expect as far as performance, you should expect with these exact specs to be able to play currently all games on high settings, competitive or first person shooters tend to run better than single player games in my experience, I’d expect 120+ frames on 1080p, or even higher than that if you drop your settings. As far as single player games, you should be able to max out most games and get a solid 60fps which is fine for single player.",Positive

Intel,"Because of high popularity of 5700X3D and 5800X3D -- and that they are now both out of production, it's likely their used prices have increased.  As a result, since you aren't on AM4 already, unless you're getting a killer deal on a used 5700X3D/5800X3D, recommend you go with 9600X + B850 + usual 32 GB 6000 CL30 kit. Should be right around 400 pounds.",Neutral
Intel,"The 5700x3d and 5800x3d are no longer the value deals that they were. They're essentially end of life so have gone up (unless you can find a deal!).    If you want cheap performance and also to keep your DDR4 RAM, i think the best deals currently are i5-14600/K/KF and a B760 DDR4 motherboard. That's going to be the best bang for your buck.    However, i don't see the AM5 parts that much more expensive. Obviously, if you're looking at 9950x3D etc then you're paying a lot. But you could get a Ryzen 5 7600/7600X/9600X that'll perform better than your 7700K for pretty cheap and a B650 board for a good price. The only spanner in the works is the price of RAM. So, in this context, going DDR4 board on last gen systems could save you a lot.",Neutral
Intel,"AM5 is a better idea, it gives you an upgrade path for the future. Something like Ryzen 5 7600 / 7600x / 9600x are all going to be far far better than your i7 7700K.   [https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/r93dTM](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/r93dTM)",Positive
Intel,"Am5 any day. The price gap even for used am4 to am5 is so small, that am5 makes so much more sense. The am4 x3d are hugely overpriced, even used. A ryzen 7600x is already equal in performance to a 5700x3d (thats like 5% slower then a 5800x3d). You pay maybe 80€ more for going AM5 but have a much better outlook for an upgrade in some years. There were some edge cases were i would have recommended going am4 used (like 16 cores or a lot of cheap ram), but with ram prices skyrocketing, thats not really an option anymore. I would go am4 if you do a really budget gaming build like with a r5 3600, or you get a REALLY good deal on a am4 prebuilt. Am5 will have a much longer lifespan, with cpu upgrades coming and reusing ddr5....",Neutral
Intel,I wouldn't buy new and get am4 that's for sure. Since your upgrading peice by peice you should get the best CPU you can afford. Get a 7600X or 9600x on AM5 and you might even get a second CPU upgrade out of it.  AM4  might not even be fast enough for an 9060,Neutral

Intel,"5800X3D & 5700X3D are out of production and thus, the prices are only getting higher. Including used prices.   Just a quick search on ebay and sold listings are showing an average of $300-350, with some at $400 or more as a bundle with motherboard and RAM.   For not much more money, at around $550, you can get a 9600X, a B850 motherboard and 32GB of DDR5.   If RAM prices weren't skyrocketing like they currently are, you could have gotten a basic AM5 setup for around $450 a few weeks ago. Some of the price hike can be explained by RAM chips being purchased for AI, due to many many data centers popping up all over major cities. But also can be explained by the upcoming holiday season in a few short weeks. Its a common trend now - you can use a price tracker like CamelCamelCamel or PCPartpicker to look at the pricing trend.   Its not really ideal to move to AM4, especially buying brand new parts - the cost difference is in AM5's favor even with the DDR5 price hike. Any better CPU upgrade down the line would require you to jump to a new platform anyway, which means CPU/MOBO/RAM at a minimum.   Hell, if you're willing to wait a few weeks to see what the holiday ""sales"" bring. (more people are becoming aware that a few weeks before the holiday season price hikes tend to happen so that things like Black Friday and Christmas sales make you believe you're getting a good deal)  Starting off with something like the 9600X build I listed below will give you far more longevity, and the socket itself will have 1 or 2 more CPU generations so you'll still have an upgrade path even if something like AM6 comes out.

Intel,No no no. It's more his cpu won't be able to get the most out of a card like that. The card is overkill for his cpu.,Negative
Intel,I disagree. His cpu is very outdated and will bottle neck any modern GPU that isn't super budget tier.,Negative

Intel,"Appreciate the back and forth on this. Frankly I just don't think I can upgrade GPU and CPU at the moment, especially if I need to up the GPU budget by $200. I think $500 is probably swing-able (just not what I was planning). But I imagine even with that push I can't reasonably do both. At the risk of sounding silly...the idea of getting a GPU now that will be limited by CPU, and then upgrading the CPU in a couple years, seems feasible and reasonable to me. I don't mind not being able to push things in terms of gaming, or having to wait a couple years to fully use the GPU's potential.   Again I've been fine with my 1060 for all these years...so it's not like I'm trying to max things out.",Neutral
Intel,"I have an R5 5600 and 5070.... Yes, there is some bottleneck... At 1080p(the card is usually 95%).  At 1440p? Minimal bottleneck, the card goes 100%, but, very rarely there is a stutter, which is alleviated with a bit of tweak on the settings.   To say it would be a bottleneck for a 9060xt or 5060ti is a stretch.",Neutral

Intel,"I have an R5 5600+ rtx5070.  There is a little bottleneck, but you will not really notice it. Especially, if you play a little with settings on 1440p or dsr.  You shouldn't worry too much... That said, 9070 or 5070 /  9060xt or 5060ti, up to you.  Please  note that, the 9070 is faster than the 5070 and you might need to dial it back a little to minimize the CPU bottleneck.  Hope that helps.",Neutral
Intel,Don't shoot the messenger. Don't believe me? Look it up yourself. These aren't my stats lol.,Negative
Intel,"Of course, and appreciate the info/clarity! Again my biggest hurdle here is just being so out of the game that I have no idea what I'm looking at. The comments here are extremely helpful, even if they are just helping me realize my original plans may not make sense, or I need to be realistic about what I may still be compromising!",Positive
Intel,"USD. But, and I realize I didn't make this clear in the OP, I also don't mind buying used if needed.",Neutral
Intel,Look I don't want you to get the wrong idea. I'm not trying to crap on the Ryzen 5600. I've simply pointed out a fact. One that op should be aware of.,Negative
Intel,Exactly. Most people don't upgrade all at once anyways unless it's a new build. It's a very normal thing.,Neutral
Intel,The Powercolor Reaper 9060xt 16gb for $350 at Newegg seems like the right move if you can swing it. Otherwise you’re back to the overwhelming mess of cross referencing past generation GPU performance and used prices.,Neutral
Intel,"Thanks. Yes I think I can, I realize my budget may have been a little unrealistic - $350 should be entirely doable. Thanks for the suggestion/tip here! That said - if we were looking in the $400-$450 range, anything you'd recommend instead?",Positive
Intel,"There’s too many variations of used options out there for me to definitively say. Looking at some charts and some prices, maybe a 4070 super? Less VRAM but still performs quite a bit better than the 9060xt and has DLSS. Older generations of AMD cards won’t have FSR4 access (right now?) which looks better than FSR3.

No one “needs” half the pc parts they get but if you keep your pcs for 6+ years then yes a 7800x3d would be a much better choice.

In your last post, we advised you that your ram was too fast because you had a CL28 ram kit. you might have over-adjusted and picked slow ram, my friend. 5600mt is good speed, but cl46 is slow reaction time.

Intel,"If you are building your computer and unless you are spending like under $700 on the computer I would recommend that you go with an AM5 CPU. AM4 only really makes sense if you really have to like get under $700 and more in the $600 and below range.  If you are building on the AM5 platform then you probably want either a 7600X or a 9600X. The 9600X is only about 3 to 5% faster than the 7600X, but the price has come down considerably and has even dipped cheaper a few times.

They shine the best when paired with a high end GPU on low end resolution because you can get ridiculous fps.

Intel,"If you can afford to step up to the 9060XT 16GB, it's much better. It's about 30-40% faster on average and has 4GB more VRAM. Not to mention better driver support and access to a better upscaler with FSR 4.   Why are you considering going down to the B580?",Positive
Intel,The b580 is a great tinkering machine or amazing if you're building for video editing first but for a PC gamer who has to ask I'd avoid it. It's fine if you literally only play new releases a month after release but for freshly released stuff or anything before like 2022 it can get rough. It's kind of like being in a really cool beta nobody's sure if Intel will commit to,Neutral

Intel,"Don't listen to the other people here. As someone who owns 9070xt, 5060ti and B580, the Intel card is an amazing performer for the price and the drivers keep getting better.    I think with XeSS it is the best budget 1440p gaming card.   The only major issue is UE5 games not performing very well, but the drivers are improving.",Positive
Intel,"i will go with B580, save your money to buy something else, since you are playing FHD then yes B580 is a better value",Positive

Intel,"Works in Windows too. But Windows has way too much overhead for all of the AI garbage, ads and integrated spyware running in the background to still be a usable operating system. Linux is much better.   The drivers install all side-by-side, and all GPUs show up as OpenCL devices. In the software you can then select which one to run on.   FluidX3D can select multiple OpenCL devices at once, each holding only one part of the simulation box in its VRAM. So VRAM of the GPUs is pooled together, with communication happening over PCIe.",Neutral

The rendering is done multi-GPU too, as domain decomposition rendering. Each GPU knows only a part of the whole fluid simulation box in VRAM and can't see the others. It only renders its own domain, at 3D offset, to its own frame with accompanying z-buffer, and copies those to CPU over PCIe. The CPU then overlays the frames.",Neutral

Intel,"The faster PCIe 4.0/5.0 and future iterations mean that dedicated SLI/Crossfire bridges are obsolete. The PCIe bandwidth nowadays is more than enough. And PCIe is the generic industry standard interface, easier to program for than proprietary hardware that's different for every vendor.   For games multi-GPU is gone for good (too few users, too large cost of development, no return of investment for game Studios). But in simulation/HPC/AI software multi-GPU is very common as it allows to go beyond the VRAM capacity of a single large GPU for cheaper.",Neutral
Intel,"sli/crossfire were killed for good reason, its just a bad time all around if half of your gpu's core/cache is located a foot away from the other half, unless your baseline performance is so damn low that the microstutters just get lost in the noise.  ultimately chiplet cpu/gpu designs are basically just an evolved form of sli/crossfire, and we're happily starting to get quite good at those.

Intel,"indeed it did, if only game devs adopted this more. Then again, the idea of two high end GPUs like we have today in a single PC is kinda horrifying.",Negative

PC will perform the best if OS is located on the closest one.   Much better off just slapping two GPUs together in a single form factor than two separate GPUs.

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative
Intel,One thing I appreciate about AMD is having the lowest CPU overhead for their graphics drivers. Makes a difference if you're CPU limited in a game.,Positive

Intel,"According to the graphs, AMD has slightly less overhead than NVIDIA.",Neutral
Intel,"No, they do not.  The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software.  They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  The main example that seems to suggest otherwise is actually a demonstration of nVidia's forced threading of DX11 games, which can increase performance despite the increased overhead it entails, when the CPU has enough headroom overall (i.e. it doesn't eat into the single-thread performance).",Negative

I think this will be great for non-gaming purposes, like Adobe, Autodesk and so on. 890M should be a photo editing powerhouse.",Positive
Intel,"I mean current consoles are already APU power houses, they can give you 120fps depending on the game, and 30-60fps depending on what mode you select.

Maybe they'll improve it by hooking it up to a wider GDDR bus in laptops, similar to how the current PS5 and Xboxes work (IIRC?)",Neutral
Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks. Intel is already moving on it and I think the main thing holding AMD back is that they rely on 3rd parties for memory packaging so the capacity goes to the more lucrative enterprise chips first.",Neutral
Intel,"The iGPU uplift is extremely underwhelming, I guess this is why Asus did the ROG Ally X model instead of waiting for these chips. I wouldnt be surprised if Lunar Lake with Xe2 passes Zen 5's iGPU at lower power levels, at higher ones im sure RNDA 3.5 will be ahead.",Negative

Intel,"It'll need to be a custom tooled APU like Aerith/Van Gogh if it is to take full advantage of the 890m.     Nearly all of the configs that release of 16cu Point APU or 40cu Halo will be an APU slapped in a chassis without an adequate power or memory bandwidth setup for the igpu.     What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra. Its desktop tower chip is behind the entry level mobile OS chip from its competitor. It is a decade behind the desktop chips of its competitor, itis hardly Monster class.",Neutral

And AMD ""can make"" such APUs -> PS5 Pro (as a more cost effective solution). AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative
Intel,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",Negative

Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't.

Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral
Intel,"This was a graphics card, not a ‘GPU’ in terms that we understand them now, just to bolster the point about how much of a disparity this comparison reveals.",Neutral
Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so?

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.

Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.

We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line.

It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.

Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report?

This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".

Intel,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place. And if this is a feature that they do not want to support, having the documentation needed to self-support the feature.",Negative

All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point.

After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.

Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Intel,"VRAM usage is specific.  In context of Unity games and VRChat - Nvidia does use less VRAM than AMD... but only in Windows, only Nvidia DX driver in Windows have this ""hidden feature"" and only with DX API. So it may be DX feature. It very common/easy to see it in VRChat large maps, or large Unity games.  In Linux - *in some cases, but it very common* - you get more VRAM usage on Nvidia compare to AMD because this how Vulkan driver implemented in Nvidia and overhead of DXVK.  P.S. For context - Unity VRAM usage is - Unity allocating ""how much it want"" and in case of two different GPU Unity may allocate less or more in DX-API, or DX-API have some internal behavior for Unity case on Nvidia so it allocating less.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

AMD is lacking in pro support for quite specific but very important things and you aren't the first professional to point this stuff out.

Intel,Darktide looks&runs way better with FSR2 than native 1080p for me. I don't know how they do it but there is no amount of AA that makes native resolution look better.,Positive
Intel,"Use Radeon Image Sharpening at 50% in the game's Radeon Settings profile when running native. FSR2 has its own sharpening pass. Many TAA implementations are blurry as fuck, which gives the illusion of better image quality when upscaling.",Negative
Intel,Okay fair enough! To me any upscaling has always looked worse than native in the games I've played and I've left it off.  Though it has undoubtedly gotten better recently - to my eyes it's never looked **better** than native resolution.,Negative
Intel,"I've used both FSR (2160p desktop) and DLSS (1080p laptop) and the loss in quality is noticeable to me. Always a softer image with less detail - yes, even DLSS. Performance always has a cost. Temporal upscaling is no different. DLAA and FSRAA actually are better than native, since they replace terrible TAA implementations and render at native.  However, this better than native upscaling narrative seems more like a belief (or a marketing push/tactic) than reality.   - If action is high enough, it probably won't matter much, but in single-player games where I like to look around, I just can't deal with the resolution loss. I'd rather turn RT off, as I did in Control (for AMD and Nvidia HW), which actually has decent RT effects.",Negative

Intel,> Enthusiast   > 1440p [...] with FSR Quality [...] 60 FPS  1440p + xxxx Quality upscaling is just another way to say 1080p you cowards. It's 2023 and enthusiast level is 1080p @ 60 FPS.   Looks pretty though with the amount of vegetation.  I'm surprised that they put the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT side by side in a game that has forced ray tracing. I guess that's the advantage of being cross platform and AMD sponsored.,Neutral

Intel,60fps with balanced upscaling on a 4080/7900xtx … That’s not a good sign,Negative
Intel,It's joever. We are officially at the point where devs are using upscaling as the standard to reach playable frame rates instead of optimizing their games.,Negative
Intel,"If you look in the top right, these seem to be based on ray tracing being enabled? If that is the case, these specs actually seem reasonable.",Neutral
Intel,"FSR and DLSS were supposed to be optional, now they seem to be mandatory in any graphics setup.",Neutral

Intel,"Really disliking this trend of all new games having ""with FSR/DLSS"" in their PC requirements tables. The requirements should all be done without any upscaling or frame generation tech to be upfront and honest about how the game will run. Upscaling will then just be an available option for users to further increase performance.",Negative
Intel,"Actually not to bad for current standards, 1440p 60 with fsr quality on a 6800xt/3080 is great if high includes RT, if it doesn't then it sucks",Negative
Intel,"So with my 6800xt, which should be able to do 1440p high settings at over 60fps easily, I'll have to use FSR just to get 60fps? Great, another unoptimized game headed our way.  So sick of the awful PC ports and such. 6800xt is still a very powerful card yet I'm seeing more and more games require it for 1440p 60fps high or even 1080p 60 fps high. Ridiculous.  The reliance on upscaling tech instead of properly optimizing the game is becoming a problem. And it seems this game has forced RT which is idiotic. RT destroys performance and should always be an option.",Negative
Intel,"If you notice, all the mentioned AMD GPUs are significantly better than Nvidia GPUs, so does that mean bad performance for AMD GPUs?",Neutral
Intel,So i bought an 1200€ card (rx 7900xtx in my region and at the time of launch) and can now enjoy new games at 60 fps with BALANCED fsr upscaling. We love to see it. /s,Positive
Intel,so I'm doomed to use FSR even at 1080p ? what a shame pc gaming has become.,Neutral
Intel,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?  (I'm not talking about this game in particular, just in general, it was same outrage w/ AW2 and that turned out better than expected)",Neutral
Intel,I hope they will bundle this game with CPUs/GPUs,Positive
Intel,holy hell so for 1080p you need a 1440p card because not even a RX 7600 is on par with a 3060ti or a 6700XT,Negative
Intel,Recently upgraded GPU and CPU and crazy that newer games are already requiring the newest GPUs to play them. Personally I don't think it's a horrible thing but at the same time it just screams horrible optimization.,Negative
Intel,This game better look like real life with those specs. I does looks beautiful!,Positive
Intel,"Another garbage with forced upscaling at baseline. When upscaling winded up - everyone was ""Hell yeah, high refresh rate AAA gaming""  Fast forward to today: ""FSR performance just to hit 1080p 60fps - yay..""   I fucking knew it.. it was so obvious upscaling will turn into this and replace game optimizations. Why optimizing shit, when you can tell people to turn on fucking FSR / DLSS / XeSS performance??   What a fucking shitshow... And few weeks back when I said I'm not gonna buy AMD GPU again because upscaling is getting mandatory and DLSS is just objectively superior - I was laughed in the face. Every major AAA game onwards will be shoving up upscaling as base line performance - so your typical 60fps marks (and 30fps - yes apparently that is still a thing on PC in 2023). There's no escape from this.",Negative

With this being a based on a movie game, I don’t have super high hopes that that’ll be the case though. Going from movie to game and vice versa almost always has bad results.   Also, displaying system requirements with upscaling is a bad joke. This is basically saying you’re not getting native 1080p 60fps without a 6800xt or 3080. Upscaling is definitely becoming the crutch a lot of folks feared it would be.",Negative

Intel,and a year ago i kept saying this here and i got downvoted to hell   its so obvious that the game engine devs and game companies pressured both nvidia and amd for this because they can release games faster and somewhat unoptimised,Negative
Intel,"Upscaling, once a promising and beneficial tech, now abused by almost every dev cause they are lazy to optimize. :(",Negative
Intel,Nope we as a community abused a nice thing,Positive
Intel,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",Neutral
Intel,Didn't take them long to make upscaling worthless.,Negative
Intel,i smell a burgeoning cottage industry of game spec reviewers!,Neutral
Intel,"I've hated upscaling since the beginning.   Now, it's being proven right in our faces that companies are no longer making 100% they're making 45% done games, and then they rely on upscaling and fake frames to do the rest.   Why have a fully optimized game that runs well natively when you can just lower the resolution by 3x then have frame generation help?   Full force ahead to frame generation= Every game will be optimized so badly that you're forced to upscale",Negative
Intel,"It’s literally right there in the hardware specs. 1080p fsr2 quality is 720p input resolution, so at native the game runs at 720p low on a 1070 or 5700.  It is the inverse of what reviewers have been doing with their benchmarks - if you are a fan who really has a stick up their ass about native res, just do the math yourself. They’ve given you all the pieces you need to calculate it out yourself, but that’s not how the game is supposed to be run so they aren’t going to put native res in the official marketing material.  Games are optimized around upscaling now and it is unhelpful and misleading to pretend otherwise. Rendering 4x as many pixels is *obviously* going to throw things off with more intensive effects, and lead to a generally unplayable experience.",Neutral
Intel,"Judging by how games work on 4090/7900 xtx, these cards turn from 4k 60 fps to 1080p 60 fps",Neutral
Intel,requirements have been a joke for over 20 years at this point i dont know why people are surprised.   on the other hand crappy devs using fancy upscaling and fake frames to get the game playable instead of just making a well made game is infuriating,Negative
Intel,yeah this is the new standard,Neutral
Intel,"RT is the future. With this game and Alan Wake 2 using software RT at all times and hardware RT for anything beyond ""low"", RT is the future.  At some point GPUs will be so powerful and game engines will have RT in the bag that RT will be used in basically all indie games...and then suddenly nobody will talk about RT anymore because RT is in everything for years.",Positive
Intel,and with fsr now standard on consoles it(or a similar tech) will be standard on pc :(,Neutral
Intel,"people also forget both AMD and nvidia didn't really offer a generation leap in GPU performance this gen, sure it's popular to call games ""unoptimized"" (I know many AAA releases are, not denying that) but the issue compounds with the fact that game devs couldn't predict a GPU generation to be this bad caused by inflated crypro-boom margins a generation prior",Negative
Intel,"As with almost every game release recently, expect the game to perform a bit better than the requirements.    Sometimes the hardware can achieve 60 FPS most of the time but drops below that in other times, so the devs just say it's guaranteed 30 FPS and call it a day. If you look at the 5700 vs 6700XT, the gap is almost 50% in most titles, this means that if the numbers for the 5700 were accurate then the 6700XT will be getting around 45 FPS at 1080p low (unless the game utilizes special hardware only available on the 6700XT) but the game targets 60 FPS at 1080p high on the 6700XT which leads me to believe the 5700 is gonna perform much better which should leave room for turning off upscaling.",Positive
Intel,"It does state ray tracing in the top right, we don't know if that's included in the requirements or not. I would definitely reserve judgment until we find out.",Neutral
Intel,Don't forget about Frame Gen too. IMO that's the worst part because that means it's 30 fps without it. Imagine the input latency...,Negative
Intel,The actual true crime here is even having fsr to begin with. It should just have dlss,Negative
Intel,Seems like they tried to cover every basis with these.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah it's kinda weird, even games that had a massive difference of performance when using dual channel RAM never listed it on their requirements :/",Negative
Intel,"I've noticed that many developers do this, for some reason developers seem to have some kind of secret passion for the 1070 lol",Positive
Intel,It's because the minimum settings is with software RT enabled and thus they're using the fastest cards without hardware RT that can reach 1080p30 FSR2.,Neutral
Intel,"GCN support is over, RDNA1 is the lowest currently supported arch.",Neutral
Intel,"In 2023, RX 5700 performs equally or better than the RTX 2060 Super/2070. The 5600XT is more like a 2060 competitor.   Either the game runs like shit on AMD hardware, or the system requirements are wrong and they just write down the components that they tested with.   Another thing is that the game is doing is software based RT by default and that might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.",Negative
Intel,"They're not, those are the cheapest/slowest GPUs that have 8 GB of VRAM. Clearly game devs are done pandering to people who bought Nvidia's e-waste.",Negative

Intel,"Honestly RT has a lot of fluff and the majority of which is the most costly for the least amount of noticeable fidelity increase. Try path tracing in Cyberpunk with reduced rays & bounces and you'll still get great soft lighting and GI without most of the performance hit when full tilt. If games only leverage certain aspects of RT then the performance is still comparable, that's also why the 3080 and 6800XT perform similarly in Fortnite with full RT/nanite/lumen settings.",Neutral

Intel,"I agree with this, that’s not that outrageous if this does include RT. Non RT would be pretty bad to need fsr but that is the quality mode.",Neutral
Intel,This is going to be the exact same situation as with Alan Wake. The game is going to come out and the requirements are going to make sense. People just aren't used to seeing games with mandatory rt.,Neutral
Intel,I would say pressured bc they announced it over a year ago and promised we will get it in september. Thats the problem with games an tech they all make promises and then cant keep the deadline. Just make smth new and when it works then announce it and make the last fine adjustments. If you make promises to early you set yourself up for failure.,Negative

Intel,Was guaranteed to happen when up scaling was announced... It's an excuse for less optimisation or to push fidelity more.  I saw a video of this avatar game it got an insane amount of plants visible at all times.,Negative
Intel,You... are.. joking... right..?,Neutral
Intel,Because it’s not coming to steam. It’ll be an epic games exclusive so everyone will pass on it until it hits steam in 18 months. At which point no one will buy an 18 month old game for full price and will wait for a 50% off sale at the minimum.,Negative

Intel,Yea I know nothing about optimizations and if it could or couldn't fix this or that. I just want them to tell me exactly what I need to run the game at X resolution a Y preset with 60 fps. If that calls for a 14900k and a 4090 then just say so.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, I think we're really beginning to see a trend here with abusing upscaling for free mileage.  Not that upscaling isn't great but...  Apart from RT, on medium settings, I can't really see    massive improvements on visual quality that would warrant such a massive increase on requirements.  UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  We'll probably see this continuing to be a trend for a while, and then as tech novelty wears out, some devs will come out with more optimized and scalable titles.  With hardware prices being as they are, and with 60fps now being highly requested in consoles as well, it's pretty much a given.",Negative
Intel,"People accepted upscaling with open arms, so now devs know they can rely on people using it. Thus they don't have to care about optimizing for native res anymore. Oh you have a 4k card? Okay well we'll make sure it can run the game at 1080p so you can upscale it.",Neutral

The game companies can't just implement one gpu company's tech and not the others bc then it'll only work on the one gpu that you implemented the tech for and it won't work on the other gpus from other companies.

Intel,They have really long way to go. Take for example Lords of the Fallen - UE5's TSR is better than FSR. Take Alan Wake 2 and you get ton of shimmering on the edges. It's also not like nvidia not improving - so while AMD makes a step forward so will do nvidia..   There's also question how much they improve without dedicated accelerators that both Intel and nvidia is using. Intel jumped late to the party and they're already ahead - which just shows how much AMD cares. It's rally embarrassing considering both XBOX and PlayStation are also relying on FSR - ant that's bigger market than what nvidia has.,Neutral
Intel,I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?  I mean the facts are the facts. I need to play on lower settings till we get a 5070 or 8800xt.,Neutral

Intel,Consoles are the baseline in most multiplat games and they've been using upscaling since forever. The real reason is just that we don't have GPUs anymore that are 10x faster than consoles like last gen. You can't bruteforce high resolutions in games that run at like 720p on consoles with GPUs that are only 2-3x faster.  If upscaling didn't exist on PC the minimum here would just be 720p at the minimum and 1080p-1440p at the max.,Negative
Intel,Next-gen doesn't mean that current gen can run it well. It means it's so far ahead that most curren-gen hardware can't run it properly + top-end hardware can only barely run it well.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly. These paid exclusive games launches only make me care less whenever they actually release.  It's not just Epic, Meta has done it with several games (Moss Book 2) and when a proper looking pcvr port comes a year later it sells bad because people forgot about it.",Negative
Intel,"Is that with significant RT? I assumed it was ""normal"" ultra settings.  Still I can play Far Cry 6 and RE4 with AMD sponsored RT at 4k native with 100fps. This game will have to look amazing to justify what... a quarter of that performance?",Neutral
Intel,"You are correct. I overlooked the part where, under Ultra settings, it said that was with FSR2. Now it doesn't seem as bad. I mean, it's still not good because it's rendering somewhere between 1080p and 1440p, but at least it's not 30 fps without Frame Gen/60 fps with it like I thought.",Neutral
Intel,"It might be, AFAIK neither Nvidia nor AMD still support their implementation of it in their drivers.  But I've tried it on a few games and it is pretty cool to me, much stronger than almost any modern 3D movie (IMO why 3D has gone into hibernation), and I gather that Cameron designed the franchise around 3D.  Plus the Avatar 1 game was in 3D.  FWIW.",Positive
Intel,This is what I am thinking too.,Neutral
Intel,"You say that, but they specifically mentioned FSR3, and just DLSS, so i have a feeling DLSS3 will have to go via a mod again.",Neutral
Intel,"i have a believe that even 4C8T will survive for the decade, like the case of that 4790K. But turns out these newer UE5 games are wrecking even newish CPU like the 3600. i mean cmon it's still a 4 years CPU old which i think it's not old yet",Neutral
Intel,Let's hope so. 30fps is far from recommended for FSR 3,Positive
Intel,Yeah I heard it works with that hoping it works with fsr3 now,Neutral
Intel,"I've noticed that for some reason newer games look blurry at 1080 even without any kind of upscaling and I'm not sure why, older game look much sharper at 1080p",Negative
Intel,"Just lazy optimisation, that’s pretty much a PS5 equivalent GPU and you can be damn sure that the console version won’t be 1080P 30fps with FSR",Negative
Intel,"No it says 5700. NOT 5700XT, and yes there is a difference. Quite literally the difference between a 1070 and 1080ti. Or a 2070 and 2080.",Neutral
Intel,no no my 7 year old card needs to be able to play at high settings. so does my low end card from today. gotta be high or its just bad,Negative
Intel,Crazy expectation? A game released in 2023 should be able to run at 1080p low 30fps on a low end card like rx6500xt (lowest end modern card you can buy now).  Optimization matters.,Neutral
Intel,"Yup, these cards came out around the time of ps4 I think..that's a long time ago in the graphical quality of games we are seeing.  People should be happy to a point that those cards can even run some of these games if upscaling helps them run that's a bonus as it means they don't need to upgrade if those graphics settings are acceptable to them.",Positive
Intel,"I have a 5700 and it does better at 1080p on these games than what is normally posted. Now it does need quality fsr but its not the worst thing, anything lower than quality is. Bottom line is these are not 100% correct and never have been.  I have zero interest in this game but the specs seem fine even though I wish upscaling wasn't what was relied on for optimization.",Neutral
Intel,"well you dont know what they mean by 30 fps. It could be de 1% lows or the average, we dont know. The easy assumption is that it will be 30 fps average. but that's crazy that a game at 1080p low cant be run by a 5700. It better be a new Crysis.  edit: apparently it uses raytracing only for lighting which would explain the hows and why it crushes the framerate so bad especially on a gpu that doesnt have hardware raytracing like the 5700.",Negative
Intel,"Or in the case of games like Alan Wake 2, you will get unplayable fps if you try to running it at 4k native max settings. Even with a 4090, you will get a glorious 20fps.",Negative
Intel,Assassins creed origins and odyssey side quests/collectibles oh my god,Neutral
Intel,Yeah it doesn't give us a actual gauge to understand what we need for set native parameters. I mentioned optimization out of concern that they rely too much on upscaling and it seems like it's the lazy way out of something. It's unrealistic that a usable gaming experience be in a top tier hardware setup that costs $2k+ and top tier hardware of just the last generation are just barely cutting it anymore.,Negative
Intel,I appreciate your insights and opinions. Thank you.,Positive
Intel,">UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  Because they market how ""good"" it looks, not how ""well"" it runs. There's a big influence from marketing perspective to place high focus on ""eye candy"", it's what sells.  The how ""well"" it runs is usually restricted to the small % of us gaming nerds. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flip_out)",Neutral
Intel,console games started upscaling way before PCs .,Negative
Intel,This sub is rife with crazy conspiracy theories. I don't think it was this insane a couple years back.,Negative
Intel,you forgot who owns one of the most popular engines out there?,Neutral
Intel,"I guess technically it would count but then everyone would flame it for looking bad. But seriouly, what happened when Ultra settings ran real smooth on top of the line hardware? Gone those times.",Negative
Intel,downvoted by devs lol,Neutral
Intel,> RTX 4080 is 50% Faster than RTX 3080.  The msrp is 71% higher too.,Positive
Intel,"Yeah at 1200 bucks and above you got one, that's true but many cards below didn't offer much.",Neutral
Intel,that's stoopid but it's somewhat more understandable. Why a 5700 would struggle so much since it doesnt have hardware raytracing,Negative
Intel,Yep it's like a 10/15% performance uplift in some games but I'd guess they would prefer to keep the requirements sheets somewhat simple.,Neutral
Intel,Why is there a dialog message about unsupported hardware when you try and run a 390X?,Negative
Intel,It can do software based RT just like every other modern GPU out there.,Neutral
Intel,Well then no wonder rx 5700 can't manage 30 fps lol,Neutral
Intel,"Wait so we are finally getting games made only with ray tracing in mind? This is actually great, 2023 is officially the year the new generation started",Positive
Intel,Avatars uses a Lumen like software RT solution.,Neutral
Intel,"yeah they never finished the sentence for some reason. The full sentences is ""its better than native, when native has forced taa!"" which is why dlaa/fsraa at native look so much better than the upscale versions. normal basic TAA is just so bad, that even upscales not using it look better than native using it",Negative
Intel,"The AA side of things might be better, but I swear no matter the resolution textures become a blurry mess even with Quality mode etc, and it irks me that most people don't seem to notice that.",Negative
Intel,Some people seem to have very low sensitivity to added blur. See also *depth of field blur* and *motion blur* being on by default in every game. It's funny how much people rage against FXAA/DoF/Motion blur but ignore DLSS.  Of course only one is tied to someone's purchasing decision :),Negative
Intel,"Yeah, thatsl happened.",Neutral
Intel,">every time I tell them that I can tell the difference between native and upscaled and it's not better then natibe they call me a liar and downvote  Well, yes, you are using shitty FSR which is literally unplayable no matter resolution instead of godly DLSS that is literally better than native even at 720p/performance. The only way you could have seen the ever unmatched DLSS for PC kings instead of the plebean FSR is through a compressed youtube video so your opinion is literally invalid. I hope I am being sarcastic enough.",Negative
Intel,"The problem is some (if not most) games have such a bad TAA it might as well be true, and if often cannot but turned off.",Negative
Intel,"""We could"" but not profitable. Just let imagine these games does not exist in our reality.",Negative
Intel,You didn't understand. It's another Swiss knife engine,Neutral
Intel,"It is indeed not a great situation. Things like this shouldn't be forced on, and it leaves me feeling like they haven't given the devs enough time to optimize the settings.",Negative
Intel,It works because most consoles players are noobs they don't care about the tech. They just want to sit on the couch and play. I'm hoping we see them start working more on FSR3 and upgrading older games to it. And you are right nvidia will keep moving forward but so will AMD. They may never catch them since they have a head start.,Positive
Intel,AMD just released drivers for Alan Wake 2 that fixed the flickering while using FSR.,Positive
Intel,The PS5 has a 6700.,Neutral
Intel,">I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?   Not exactly. It's a custom quasi-RDNA2 design (has the improved RDNA2 compute units, but it's missing a few features such as fully-DX12-compliant mesh shaders and VRS-capable ROPs).  For most purposes, it's pretty comparable to a 6700 (non-XT), with the same number of CUs (36), and similar clockspeeds.",Neutral
Intel,"Oh, wow. I didn't know that. But it'll likely be on a similar level as UE5, right?",Positive
Intel,Next gen DOES NOT MEAN that your CURRENT GEN hardware can run it well for sure... Why don't people get that?,Negative
Intel,That reminds me to grab moss 1 and 2. I just got a quest 3.   Agreed though. I’ve been waiting for kingdom hearts 3 to come to steam for so long that I’m basically going to skip it at this point. It’s still stuck on the epic game store.,Neutral
Intel,Far cry 6 and re4 are older and or lower demanding games.  And yes any Mode here does either Hardware or Software rt from. Min to max.,Neutral
Intel,It's a 4 year old cpu yes... But how it was built (4c) was like 10 12 years now old.  6 cores are since a few years already base and more and more 8 cores are standard.,Neutral
Intel,TAA,Neutral
Intel,Temporal anti aliasing.,Neutral
Intel,"TAA is the devil. it forces a blur on every frame, and only gets worse as the resolution goes lower. its why fsr, xess, and dlss can look better than """"native"""" because it doesnt use the horrid plain taa solution so many games do. and why dlaa, and fsraa are so important and need to replace taa completely",Negative
Intel,"Ahh, welcome to r/FuckTAA",Neutral
Intel,Even 4K looks blurry with some implementations of TAA,Negative
Intel,they're giving you the bare minimum until your upgrade!,Negative
Intel,Because they are built with upscaling in mind so they have a blurry looks intentionally as it works best with aggressive upscaling.,Neutral
Intel,"Not even close, you're completely out of your mind. The 5700xt is 9% faster than the 5700. The 1080ti is **32%** faster than a 1070 and the 2080 is **19%** faster than the 2070.

Intel,"Well the difference is only 256 shaders more on the 5700xt. The 5700xt has 2560 shaders and the 5700 2304. That's 11% more. That's not that much.  The 1080ti has 86% more cuda cores than the 1070, as well as more and faster memory. I would not compare now so haha",Neutral
Intel,"The 5700 and 5700xt is more like a 1070 and 1070ti situation. It's not that big a gap, and you can close it even tighter because the majority of RX 5700 cards can be flashed to a 5700xt bios tightening the gap farther.",Neutral
Intel,"The 1070 was released in 2016. Its already the end of 2023. That card belong to ps4 era. Wake up.   People in this sub are delusional, really.",Negative
Intel,Those are some dumbass expectations. Maybe you should correct them instead of blaming the developers for it.,Neutral
Intel,"The 6500XT offers $200 2016 performance. In fact its often worse because of how gimped it is interface wise. Its one of the worst products released in recent years.  Its not the game developers fault AMD pretty much rebadged the RX 480 4 times and they can't be expected to sink their optimization to that level.  RX 480, RX580, RX 5500XT and RX6500XT are virtualy the same product performance wise. RX 5500XT is the most consistent one of the lot offering a somewhat more modern arhitecture in its 8GB variant. The 6500XT on the other hand while on a newer arhitecture is an unmitigated disaster that is on par at best and sinks even below the RX580 when memory, bus and PCIE interface constrained.  The console baseline is around 6700XT/2070 Super/3060ti level. People better get used to that as its gonna become or already has become the norm for 1080p high settings gaming. The 5700 is upwards of 30% slower by default while also having less hardware features. Its gonna become the minimum norm going forward alongside the 2060's of your time.",Negative
Intel,"the 1070 was 2016, the 5700 was 2019. While both not new its not 10 years old like the PS4 (2013)",Neutral
Intel,This is literally only true if you use path tracing. I think you're trying to insinuate the game is unoptimized when it just scales really high with visual features if your hardware supports it. It straight up runs great for the visual features it uses.,Neutral
Intel,"That was exclusive to console releases, no? And never to the point of replacing AA sharpening and rendering the game from 720p…",Negative
Intel,No I havent. AMD is bigger than Epic.,Negative
Intel,"Right, you'll have different complaints but complaints none the less even though the new Ultra might still look slightly better prior gen games and offer high FPS but people would complain that the graphics are not advancing fast enough, they look the same etc etc.  Yah those days are likely gone but it's hard to say if it's because the game is unoptimized or if the dev is really pushing the limits of what they can do graphically and use upscaling as a buffer because what they have in mind, or what they intend to show is too taxing for current hardware. We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it. This is why I've never in my life ever pre-ordered a game. I still don't understand why people do it (esp now that games are digital) but lot of people do. Then again I've never really paid for a ""skin"" or some other visual add-on so maybe that's what attracts people.  I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets. The presets are all relative anyways. There's no universal settings that define what each preset represents.  I just don't get the outrage on these minimum spec sheets compared to what the game is showing graphically. At least wait until it releases and we have some hard data.",Negative
Intel,"I'm also a dev dood sometimes it's literally a ""foutage de geugle"" I had a friend who talk about how shit devs in EA (the people who's making the engine) code and doesn't optimise",Negative
Intel,"The commenter I replied to said there wasn't a big generational improvement for GPUs, while I said there was. But I agree that 4080 is expensive for what it offers.",Neutral
Intel,It was the same price as a 3090 at launch and offers 90% more performance.  It was definitely a generational leap.,Positive
Intel,It's software ray tracing which isn't accelerated by hardware.,Neutral
Intel,and i guess it can be hard to tell if ram is dual or single rank with just two sticks of it too.,Neutral
Intel,>might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.  I was pointing out that 1070 doesn't have hardware RT either.,Negative
Intel,So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?,Negative
Intel,"Why not make it toggleable though, you can choose other graphics settings so it makes no sense. Most people don't play games with RT enabled",Negative
Intel,Still kinda weird that they put the RX 5700/A750 on the same ballpark as the 1070... Being that the newer GPUs actually perform closer to a 1080(Ti).,Neutral
Intel,Sounds like improperly configured negative LOD bias. If you have Nvidia you can fix it with nvinspector. On AMD there's nothing you can do IIRC if Devs mess it up.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly what I'm telling them all the time, that I can see difference in textures, in hair, fences, powerlines etc. And every time I get downvoted by the army of ""but it looks better then native"". I feel like majority of that sub needs to go get a prescription for new glasses",Negative
Intel,"So if you stopped measuring who's bigger, why do you think I have no access to DLSS? Tested on rig with 4080 on a C2 42"" screen. Once you stop thinking with the tip of your head where probably Nvidia's logo is tattooed or maybe Jensen's face, who knows, you could come to realization that one person have access to more hardware then only his personal rig.  Do I say that FSR is better then DLSS? No! Both of them have their issues, but none of them is better then native. Keep on fanboying mate, instead of providing normal convoy as grownups",Neutral
Intel,I don't think YOU understand what you're talking about.  Did you seriously expect Snowdrop to be something used in like one game and then discarded completely?,Negative
Intel,"The thing is: creating good looking lightning with RT is much easier than with prebaked illumination. I can fully understand, why developers of new games are using RT as the basis of their game.",Positive
Intel,Minimum requirements go up as games get/look better. They probably made this game with the series s as the minimum. Low settings probably looks better than high in most games.   Rt for the last few years has been added on top of already complete games. Now games are being made with rt as the standard and they would have to manually do a ton of extra work to support 7+ year old hardware. It's the same as having to drop support for last gen consoles to be able to deliver a better game.,Neutral
Intel,"And still - superior upscaling makes it worth paying extra, RT on higher end is worth paying extra. AMD even this gen doesn't undercut price by enough, especially in EU where power efficiency also play a role. For example, assuming I'm gonna use GPU for 2 gens, then I save ~90-100€ with my usage just on electricity alone. I know it's over period of 4 years, but still it's price difference that will recoup over time, even if I have to pay extra upfront. AMD is simply no longer a value proposition.",Neutral
Intel,"They did not, lol - that fixes completely different thing, not the FSR caused shimmering edges.",Negative
Intel,Both excellent 👌 Down the Rabbit Hole was another solid one.,Positive
Intel,"RE4 came out this year.  Anyway the difference between us is I don't think any lighting effect is worth a $1,000 GPU using 1080p resolution and 60fps, but I know many disagree. That's life.",Neutral
Intel,"3600 and the 3300x was built with the TSMC 7nm if i recall, that was 2018 cutting edge tech. and somehow in gaming it's already obsolete. i was planning to replace mine with 5700x  but i cancel it because it's still very much capable for what i do now. but now after UE5 i think i'll reconsider it again, maybe even as far as 5800X3D",Neutral

Intel,"Out of curiosity what resolution do you usually game at and at what distance? I find taa usually looks pretty good in modern games, but I'm also playing on a TV (48 inches but I'm not at monitor distance anymore). When I played on my 1920x1200 monitor I HATED TAA, well, not as much as fxaa, but moreso than smaa, and I missed msaa or SGSSAA with a passion. Now on the TV at 4k (lol, usually not on a 6700xt), 1440p, or even 1080p I find TAA can do a pretty decent job paired with varying levels of the Radeon sharpness adjustment in the adrenaline drivers. But again, probably due to viewing distance.  Looks leagues better than FXAA and I prefer it to SMAA now. But again, I'm sitting further away and tweaking sharpening to my liking. FSR2 seems to be a wash most of the time but the performance gain is worth it.",Positive
Intel,You dumbass do understand that even the console version of the recent games are total mess? Alan wake 2 have to run on reduced settings to even reach 30fps on xbox/PS. Callisto protocol used to have frametime issue on consoles. Console ports still targets 30fps on quality settings with upscaling while target should be 60fps with 120fps for performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, seems you are correct, it was the ps4 pro that came out in 2016, still, I wouldn't expect that to be capable of running some of the games we are seeing now without some serious compromises.",Neutral
Intel,I never said that Alan Wake 2 is unoptimised. I just said that even a 4090 can’t max out the game at native 4K resolution.,Negative
Intel,epic is tencent...,Neutral
Intel,"In terms of absolute numbers sure, 3090 always had a stupid price tho for being 10% faster than a 3080.   In terms of performance per dollar the 4090 even at 2x 3080 performance was worse value since you pay 1600 not 1400.",Negative
Intel,"Yes, you either have to get the spec sheet of the RAM modules (That even then it may not specify if it's a single/dual rank module) or test it in a system and use HWinfo/CPU-Z. Not as straightforward as dual channel that's mostly just using two identical modules.",Neutral
Intel,You don't need RT hardware to do software RT. That's what I'm saying.,Neutral
Intel,"For this particular game, there is a software fallback. Also, even if we did get a game that mandated hardware support for RT they'd still likely build it with console in mind so even RDNA2 GPUs shouldn't have issues",Neutral
Intel,"The first RT/DLSS capable cards are 5 years old now, way older than the current consoles. You are definitely not being left behind if you're only outdated by 1 gen lol",Neutral
Intel,I mean the last non ray tracing cards were released 4 years ago (1650/60 and 5000s from AMD),Neutral
Intel,Games running poorly on computers weaker than current gen consoles isn't exactly anything new.,Neutral
Intel,"No, you have multiple generations of games from prior to raytracing to enjoy.  Games shouldn't be held back forever just because someone wants to game on a GeForce2 MX400.",Neutral
Intel,You are stuck playing older games. Unless someone can find a way to disable it with a mod.,Negative
Intel,> So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?  A gen old is second gen RT e.g. rtx 3000.  We're halfway through the third RT/matrix generation right now.,Negative
Intel,Yes hah,Neutral
Intel,"The 3090 or 6950xt will very likely run this game extremely well, they're a gen old.",Positive
Intel,"For the AMD GPU, it's probably because minimum will be the max it will support. Medium probably requires Hardware RT.  For Intel, I don’t know. Perhaps it signal not so great optimization for Intel GPUs...",Neutral
Intel,DLSS is very strong in thin lines like fences & hair. Much better than most TAA solutions. Not sure about FSR in general.  An example: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6erA6BVkAAuf_M?format=jpg&name=large  Only DLSS resolves the lines properly.,Positive
Intel,"I mean, it's not that black and white. Quality upscaling to 1080 will obviously be more noticeable than 4k. Maybe you *can* tell the difference between 4k native and dlss quality, but people aren't gonna believe you unless you prove it with some kind of blind test, but I doubt you'd be willing to go out of your way to do that.  Even if you could, the benefits of better aa might outweight some negligible drop in textures or whatever it is upscaling reduces. Though that's irrelevant when DLAA or NAA are options too, I guess.",Neutral

Intel,Nice. It’s on the list. Thanks man,Positive
Intel,Yes.... 7nm was but 4 cores the actual important thing was obsolete like 10 or 12 years ago.,Neutral
Intel,Probably because TAA is (unfortunately) more prevalent than it ever was.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, most people are FINE with it. Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  The thing is, you have sharpening filters today. You can adjust the sharpening for TAA. You can make it look oversharpened if you want. There's driver level sharpening for both AMD and NVIDIA. Both also have software sharpening filters.  And DLSS and FSR bot have sharpening sliders.  There's 3 ways to adjust how blurry and how sharp the game looks for everyone. It's a non issue and even Digital Foundry acknowledges the benefits of TAA for game devs vs things like the blur. At the end of the day, these games are looking great...in this era, with exceptions. Not all games are blur. The whole blur thing was like in the past 4 years since upscalers started and TAA became the norm. But with all the sharpening options, and with devs actually used to making TAA not so soft looking, things are definitely getting a lot better for TAA.",Neutral
Intel,Oh my bad if I read that wrong,Negative
Intel,And I'm saying 1070 doesn't have hardware RT so it's just as gimped as AMD cards when doing RT.,Negative
Intel,Still pretty annoying nonetheless. Until it's stable no way should it be forced upon a game when someone's willing to run it normally at native.,Negative
Intel,"and the 2080ti is still winning, best purchase in gpu i made in a long time.",Positive
Intel,imagine being mad that 4 year old cards arent high end,Neutral
Intel,I'm on a 6700XT. 🙇. I just feel very shocked that I would probably need a gpu upgrade soon. With the demands of new games. Also 1440p ruined me.,Negative
Intel,"Technically makes sense, but they can just make RT something you can toggle between Software/Hardware and they also could just add the Vega 56 in the requirement sheet being that was AMD's competitor to the 1070 or they could've added the GTX 1080(Ti)/RTX 2060(Super) into the sheet.  On Intel's side they only have the A580 as the closest GPU to a 1070, even when it's too similar to the A750 performance wise :/",Neutral
Intel,"It is that black and white for me. I can immediately see the added image softness from upscaling, and it's especially prevalent with DLSS 2.5+ unless you enable a sharpening filter. DLAA also has weird issues like blurring textures (almost like it reverts to initial mipmap) while moving, usually at mid-distance from camera. It's too distracting and I have to go back to regular TAA. Immediately goes away.  1440p to 2160p is better than 720p to 1080p, but it's still noticeable. Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible? No. Actually changing monitor resolution outside of native and having all UI elements scaled looks terrible. That was what we used to do and upscaling is much better than that alternative. LCD panels need to stay at native signal resolution and GPU should scale render resolutions.",Negative
Intel,"And you look at static image all the time while gaming? It's different story when movement is involved, that's where you find all the artefacts you get. Static image doesn't tell a thing when it comes to gaming",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, and that's driving me crazy. I really couldn't stand it in Cyberpunk (in other titles it's either hit or miss), that I play it in native 4k instead.",Negative
Intel,"Wouldn't phrase it like that tough. I had that choice too in January, and actually by going 4070Ti instead of 7900XT I would be able to play Cyberpunk in higher fidelity and better frames then on mine, because AMD cooked FSR3.0 almost a year in the oven, and God knows how long it will take for CDPR to add it to the game, if ever considering that active development on game is ended and they are on bug fixing sprint right now. Also AMD needs to fix FSR in general, because how it works with smaller details like hair and fences is awful. But don't get me wrong, I love my card, just feel I git sold on features that would come handy right kow instead of when I don't need them anymore",Neutral
Intel,"Sorry mate, guess I need to read comments early morning instead of late night, just saw that last bit. My apologies. I'm just tired of upscalare wars whatever sub I go, and green team fanboys screaming that ""FSR is shit, DLSS is better then native"" and then throwing around static images for comparison",Negative
Intel,"It's for textures, not object edges from FSR use, lol. Two completely different things",Neutral
Intel,"people echoing the same shit like ""ooh 4C is obsolete, you need to upgrade that geriatric cpu"". 4C is still solid for gaming (ofc no UE5) and literally anything beside doing compute intensive professional workloads.",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening makes the image less blurry, but it doesn't recover the texture detail lost from TAA blur.",Negative
Intel,"""Even Nvidia foundry""   \---   they are like chief proponents of blur-tech and they don't care about how sharp and easy-to-see the image is. TAA flattens the image so you can't see which objects are far and which are near, you have to strain your eyes and mind to determine that which is unbearable to many. Just give us option to disable it even if it breaks some effects (which is just lazy thing to do on the side of devs)",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening fixes blur, not clearity. That is TAA destroys+add significant ghosting no matter the implementation.      Sharpening looks was worse than the normal cleairy of games, it's not the same thing at all.      >Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  We are mad because it being forced 1 and 2 it's being used to hide lazy effects that break without temporal frame smearing. People are now punished for turning off forced frame smearing.",Negative
Intel,And I'm saying that maybe the GTX 1070 is better at even software RT compared to AMD cards with no RT hardware. GTX 10 series card did get RTX support through CUDA even though they were horribly bad at it. Older AMD cards with no RT hardware didn't get any support like that from AMD.,Neutral
Intel,"You're not forced to use upscaling though. Unless you replied to the wrong person this is about ray tracing, which can be run at native just fine. If your GPU can't handle RT at native res, then just use upscaling.",Neutral
Intel,The minimum requirements for this game includes de 1070: a 7-year-old gpu from 2016.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm not really shocked, and was out there telling people not to buy those cards on day 1 in large part because of their deficiencies in RT performance and complete lack of matrix accelerators (which Nvidia and Intel have both made a large part of their architecture and got shockingly good results with - DLSS and matrix-XeSS are twice as good as FSR)",Negative
Intel,5700 was probably the lowest AMD card they had to test with.,Neutral
Intel,"It also looks better in gameplay, less ghosting, less shimmering, less aliasing.   So which one looks better? You clearly see the difference in textures/fences/powerline, right?  I even made it easier for you, both images are 1080p output.",Positive
Intel,I personally didn't try DLSS even once but FSR 2.0 does have shimmering I notice to various degrees. It was very noticable on fur in Ratchet & Clank cutscenes for example. Overall I am just happy my 5700xt could still keep up with 1440p.,Neutral
Intel,Hmm yeah whatever you want to believe and let's you sleep.  Have a nice day.,Positive
Intel,AMD CAS is aimed to restore detail,Neutral
Intel,"They aren’t chief proponents of anything, TAAU has been popular for well over a decade at this point and it’s the default approach for consoles (checkerboarding has moire and aliasing issues) and digital foundry simply recognizes this is the reality of how the console world has settled on doing graphics.",Neutral
Intel,The problem with Nvidia is they are massively overpriced. One 4080 would probably cost the same as my whole build or more.,Negative
Intel,"Yes I see which one looks better, and as I said before it's a static image. While I didn't use upscaling in this same exact example, I can go by my own experience and tell that it doesn't look better then native let's say in same Cyberpunk or any other game. And I will beleive my own eyes on my own screen then static images tossed around. TBH, in my opinion it all depends on screen and screen size too, as to me that difference between upscaled and native was less noticible on my old 27"" 1440p screen then it is now on 42"" 4k. DLAA tough, that's another story",Neutral
Intel,"I tried both, and neither of them are better then native as people tend to claim. In my testing FSR have big problem with smaller details like hair, fur, fences, powerlines and as you mentioned, you get severe shimmering effect. I really hope AMD will keep on working on it, an try to get away from that. But DLSS also adds shimmer, it's just less visible then in FSR (atleast in my testing on Cyberpunk pre 2.0), and whatever upscaling method I've used I also could see that image is upscaled (lower res textures here and there etc.). I like idea being upscaling tech, it helps prolong life of GPUs, and for more powerful GPUs to run higher settings with more fidelity, but there's still work to do on them as they aren't perfect yet.",Negative
Intel,Yeah but a 3060ti didn't,Neutral
Intel,"In Cyberpunk you are not comparing upscaling vs no upscaling at the same settings though. You are comparing low RT native vs path traced upscaling and at 4K, the decission there is absolutely clear. On my 4k OLED screen, upscaled PT is so clearly the way to go, there is no competition.",Neutral
Intel,"The gameplay looks exactly like the image + your typical TAA/DLSS smearing. And as I said, in my example DLSS also looks better in gameplay, because as you see... native has a ton of aliasing which is super noticeable while playing (shimmering). There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling. Talking about native is nonesense, just image quality counts and thats were DLSS or even FSR 2 (some games) gets better and better. There is a reason why consoles use it... it looks better than without it.",Positive

Intel,The future is not in native resolution so this is really pointless information.  Cyberpunk looks absolutelt mindblowlingy insane with all the extra graphical bells and whistles it has gotten over the years and with Nvidia’s technology it runs so damn smooth as well.,Positive
Intel,4.3fps lol. No amount of upscaling is going to fix that and make it playable. People were saying the 7900xtx had 3090ti levels of RT when it launched. A 4060 ti is 50% faster then it.,Negative
Intel,That's actually pretty amazing for any GPU to get a metric in frames per second instead of minuites per frame.,Positive
Intel,"Meh I get like 90+ fps with everything cranked with RR, FG and DLSS(Balanced) toggled on with my 4090 @ 4k.  Path tracing does introduce ghosting which is annoying buts not really noticeable most times but at the same time with RR enabled it removes shimmering on 99% of objects that is normally introduced with DLSS so I am willing to compromise.   Honestly as someone who used to have a 7900XTX I am disappointed with AMD its clear that AI tech in gaming is the way forward and they just seem so far behind Nvidia now and even Intel(going by some preview stuff). FSR is just not even comparable anymore.",Negative
Intel,Who cares when it looks worse than with dlss and ray reconstruction on top of running a lot worse? Native res 4k is pointless.,Negative
Intel,"Well the upscaling in this game is really good, DLSS with ray reconstructions AI accelerated denoiser provides better RT effects than the game at native with its native Denoiser.  Also Path tracing scales perfectly with resolution so upscaling provides massive gains. using DLSS quality doubles performance to 40fps, and dlss balanced gives 60fps on average, performance about 70-80 or 4x native 4K, that includes the 10-15% performance gain RR gives as well over the native denoiser as well.  I've been playing with about 60fps on average 50-70. with DLSS Balanced and RR and its been amazing. I don't like frame gen tho since it causes VRR flickers on my screen",Positive
Intel,"Running Ray Tracing or Path Tracing without DLSS or Ray Reconstruction is like intentionally going into a battlefield without any gear whatsoever, it's absolutely pointless and suicidal, what we can clearly see here though is top of the line 7900 XTX losing against already mediocre mid-range 4060 Ti by over 50%, which is just beyond embarrassing for AMD Radeon.  All this says to me is AMD Radeon need to get their shit together and improve their RT / PT performance, otherwise they will continue to lose more Marketshare on GPU department no matter how hard their fanboys thinks that they are pointless features, just like DLSS was back on 2020 right?  Also, with my 4070 Ti OC i can run it at average of over 60 FPS at 1440p DF optimized settings with DLSS Balanced + Ray Reconstruction without even using DLSS Frame Gen, with it on i can get over 80+ FPS",Negative

I've tried many times with different ray-tracing options and they all look good and all. But in the end I closed them all, turned back to Ultra Quality without ray-tracing and started playing the game over 120FPS.  This is a good action fps game now. I need high fps with as low latency as possible. So who cares about ray-tracing and path-tracing.  Yeah ray-tracing and path-tracing are good. But we are at least 2-3 generations away for them to become mainstream. When they are easily enabled on mid-range gpus with high-refresh rate monitors, they will be good and usable then :)",Positive

Intel,"""Get Nvidia if you want a good ray tracing experience""  Yes Nvidia GPUs give a better ray tracing experience but is it really worth it if you are required to turn on DLSS? Imo, the more AI-upscaling you have to turn on, the worse the Nvidia purchase is.   I have a 6900XT and I will readily admit that the RT experience (ultra RT, no path tracing) at native 1080p resolution is ok, like 30-45 FPS (around 50 on medium RT settings), but if I turn RT lighting off (so RT shadows, sunlight, and reflections are still present) suddenly I get pretty consistent 60 FPS (i left my frames tied to monitor refresh rate, so 60 FPS is my max) and i can't tell the damn difference at native 1080p compared to RT medium or Ultra.   So would I spend another $400-$1000 to get an imperceptible outcome (imperceptible to me that is)? Most definitely not.",Negative

Intel,"Once they introduced this dlss upscaling anti-lag all these gimmicks I don't think we've seen true 4K native and almost anything lately.  This is maybe one game that does look that good but many of the games don't look that great and have some really serious system requirements when there are games that look much better and are much better optimized.  Companies are taking shortcuts, instead of optimizing they give you suboptimal and use FSR dlss all these gimmicks.  Don't get me wrong I always thought it was great for people who wanted to reach a certain frames per second someone with a weaker system to allow them to play at least the minimal at a steady frame rate.  It just seems like this is the normal now non-optimized games.  The 4090 is a beast if you could only get about 20 frames native with Ray tracing it tells you everything you need to know about Ray tracing.  It needs to be reworked that needs to be a new system I believe one real engine has it built in in a certain way probably not as good as Ray tracing directly.  To me it seems like ray tracing is hampering many games that tried to add it, too much focus on that instead of actual making a good game.

Intel,TRUE! i think 5-10 years was the actual point in time where anybody should have paid their hard earned dollar for raytracing gpus. instead ppl dished out $1000s for the RTX2080/Ti and now are sitting on them waiting for raytracing to happen for them xD,Neutral
Intel,Who knows what new tech will be out in even 4 years lol,Neutral
Intel,"And that’s when I’ll turn on this setting in my games. Fuck having to pay $1600 for a sub 30fps experience. Path tracing is far from being a viable option, it’s more like a proof of concept at this point.",Negative
Intel,"You wish, GPU makers have stagnated like it's crazy, even the graphics have peaked. I expected to see CGI level graphics like Transformers now",Negative
Intel,"...but will cost your everlasting soul, body, firstborn and parents. If it's on sale.",Neutral
Intel,It is path trancing though. The technology used by Pixar to make Toy Story 4 (though they spent up to 1200 CPU hours for one frame) Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story. And they had their supercomputers working on it. It is a miracle of modern technology that it even runs real time.,Positive
Intel,"You basically need a 4090 to crack 60 fps at 1440p w/ dlss on quality without frame gen. It looks good, but not good enough to run out and buy a 4090.",Negative
Intel,"Same card, I just turned off RT at 4K. 75-120fps is better than 40 with muddy but accurate reflections",Positive
Intel,"The 7900xtx is one of the worst gpus iv ever had lol on paper it looks so so good, In games it just play isn’t. Fsr is garbage, 4080 mops the floor with it :( plus the drivers from amd besides starfield have been awful this generation",Negative
Intel,I think that most of the progress will go together with software tricks and upscalers.,Neutral
Intel,"lol. And you missed the 2080Ti.   Every result under 10 fps is just to be ignored, it isn't representing anything outside of ""woot, the card managed to chuck a frame our way"".",Negative
Intel,That's VRAM for you,Neutral
Intel,we are counting decimals of fps its just all margin of error.,Neutral
Intel,If you buy a card with low ram that card is for right now only lol,Neutral
Intel,Wake me up when a $250 GPU can run this at 1080p.,Neutral
Intel,Well DLSS isn't best. DLAA is,Positive
Intel,Reviews have been saying that the game looks better with DLSS than native. Not to mention runs extremely better.,Positive
Intel,Can’t you just disable TAA? Or do you just have to live with the ghosting?,Neutral
Intel,TAA is garbage in everything. TAA and FSR can both get fucked,Negative
Intel,"Yeah. 70 to 100fps on a 4080, but with 3440x1440 and DLSS-quality-FG-RR (nvidia needs new nomenclature....)",Neutral
Intel,"same, high refreshrate at 4k with optimized settings + PT + FG. With a 4080 of course, it's insane that it can look and run this great.",Positive
Intel,"Not exactly. Path tracing is just ray tracing, but cranked up to 99% with the least amount of rasterization possible.",Neutral
Intel,"> Give it 2 gens and you are going to get 4k60 here.  Assuming the 5090 literally doubles a 4090 (unlikely), that only gets us to 4K 40hz.  Assuming a 6090 doubles that, 80. which won't be bad.  Going with more conservative 50% boosts. 5090 will give 30. 6090 will give 45.  And i feel like 50% is being very generous, as nvidia have claimed moores law is dead and they can't advance beyond a 4090 by much. I'd guess we get 30% uplift in 5090 and maybe 10-15% uplift in 6090. So we'd still be under 4K30.",Neutral
Intel,Imagine buying a 4090 and then using upscaling.,Neutral
Intel,Path tracing is so much more demanding than ray tracing due to light scattering being modelled. It is a marvel it even runs.,Positive
Intel,PC gaming is in Crysis.,Neutral
Intel,Well it's a good thing 99.999999% of PC gamers don't give a shit about ray or path tracing.,Negative
Intel,You're the first other person other than myself I've run into that had an XTX but ended up with a 4090 in the end.,Neutral
Intel,"Plus frame generation works very well in Cyberpunk in terms of image quality. In some games, you need to get closer to ~80 fps output for an acceptable image quality with FG. But the FG in CP2077 is decent with 60 fps output, ~~and I get ~65-70 fps output with quality DLSS + FG at 4k on a 4090.~~ EDIT: I misremembered what I was getting. With path tracing, DLSS quality, frame generation, and ray reconstruction, I got 80.1 fps with the benchmark!  Of course there's the matter of latency, and the latency of CP2077 with FG output of ~65-70 fps isn't great. So I'll often use DLSS balanced + FG. Thanks to ray reconstruction, this now looks very close enough native 4k (to my eyes), with acceptable latency (to me), at a high framerate output.",Positive
Intel,"Nvidia features are always useless until AMD copies them a year or two later, only then they become great features 😁",Positive
Intel,"Tbh, list the games that have ray tracing right now. Pretty few.  It's not about being a fanboy of amd, but ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick, not because it's unnoticeable or bad, just because it's not ""popular"" (I myself really like it). I would personally go amd over nvidia because those 50 or so euros more that nvidia has against the amd counter parts simply are too much for just better rt and  dlss. I could spend those for a better amd card with generally better performance.  Regarding dlss, personally I would just lower the graphics before resorting to kinda bad generated frames, fsr even worse. But that's my point of view.  I find that amd still has to fix some driver issues but other than that, they are a fine brand. (so is nvidia)",Neutral
Intel,Yeh because native 4k looks worse than dlss + RR 4k,Negative
Intel,"Yeah the game with DLSS, RR and path tracing at 1440p looks amazing and with very high fps",Positive
Intel,What's the point of having $5000 PC when you're still gonna have literally the same graphics as $1000 PC then?,Negative
Intel,"This is a tech demo. That's the whole point. It's not really playable yet, but the game really is meant to showcase what is possible in the future and how close we are getting. That's what Nvidia is doing here by funding this whole project.  Crysis who many people are comparing this to, was in itself quite revolutionary for its time. The destructible environment in Crysis to this day holds up, and that was it's killer feature really.  You're gonna have swings at the future that miss as well, and that's ok.",Positive
Intel,"Did you try DLSS?  Imagine getting down voted for asking if he was using DLSS. What a fragile community. Sometimes it's okay to use DLSS, other times you better not or people will come to your house with torches",Negative
Intel,VRAM,Neutral
Intel,"Depends on what you are after i guess, is it worth it for me? Absolutely, DLSS+FG+RR with PT is a great experience.",Positive
Intel,still better than 90% of games in 2023,Positive
Intel,Arguably better now Ray Reconstruction has been added. It's quite a big image quality upgrade.,Positive
Intel,"…no it does not, unfortunately. Have you seen the artifacting in Cyberpunk?",Negative
Intel,"Someone ate up the marketing. I often see people wonder why games are so unoptimized today, your answer is right here. \^",Negative
Intel,All graphics you see on your computer screen is fake,Negative
Intel,Path tracing is more demanding than Ray tracing,Positive
Intel,"That's why I downscale from 1440p to 1080p, running DLSS and using Contrast Limited Sharpening. It looks better than native resolution and still performs well.",Positive
Intel,I guess between the 3090 and the 4070,Neutral
Intel,Yep hahaha,Neutral
Intel,RemindMe! 7 years,Neutral
Intel,"No, this tech is around so game developers can sell more copies of their games by making them look better. The only reason why Nvidia is winning is because their GPUs are much better at intensive ray-tracing.",Positive
Intel,"This is an absurd, fanboyish thought lmao",Negative
Intel,dont let novidia marketing see this youll get down voted into oblivion,Negative
Intel,I would still argue it's still in proof of concept stage. The tech will only become viable once the flagship GPU'S start getting 4k 60fps at native. That will the allow the lower end GPU'S to get 4k 60 or 1440p 60 upscaled.,Neutral
Intel,I mean I have no problem playing at 30fps dlss balance at 1080p DF optimized settings on a 2080ti with pathtracing idc what anyone says RT/PT is the future it just looks so much better than Rasterization,Positive
Intel,"Possibly a little more. Assuming that the leaked 1.7x improvement is right and path tracing performance scales the same, that would be about 34 fps at 4k native. Might be possible to hit 60fps or close to it with DLSS Quality.",Neutral
Intel,It could as well do 60fps if Nvidia adds a lot of path tracing HW into the GPU.,Neutral
Intel,Fanboyism of both kinds is bad,Negative
Intel,"It won't end, but hopefully we see games that have art designed with RT lighting and reflections in mind.  Cyberpunk isn't it. We'd need a full rebuild of the game, every location, every asset and surface remade, so it looks like originally intended by the artists.",Neutral
Intel,Since it needs more than 10gb vram,Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is more optimized than majority of games that came out in last two years. Just because you can't run it at 4k 120 fps with path tracing doesn't mean it's not optimized.,Negative
Intel,It’s not unoptimized at all. Game runs great for the quality of the graphics. You guys just don’t understand the insane amount of power path tracing takes. The fact you can do it at all rn is insane but once again people just throw “unoptimized” at it because they don’t understand the technical marvel happening in front of their eyes.,Negative
Intel,"No, this game is actually very well optimized. It's just extremely demanding at 4k native, which is why DLSS exists.  It would be unoptimized if it ran like this while looking like nothing special, but this is probably the game with the best graphics, period. At the very least, it's certainly the game with the best lighting.",Positive
Intel,"and people will be like ""well RT is the future""  raster was fine for over 15 years and raster games look great but we get it we must let incompetent game devs and their bosses make shit quality games because average gamer is ready to spend $100 to pre-order electronic version of horse shit and then justify it for years because they can't admit they wasted money",Negative
Intel,It's settled that you have no idea what you talking about,Negative
Intel,Its full path tracing u cannot really optimize this much.,Negative
Intel,"It always did. Most games don't scale well, Cyberpunk does.  Look at the last two years of pc ports and you will understand how cyberpunk looks and performs like it's black magic.",Neutral
Intel,"Baked illumination requires you to choose where to add light sources and how the lighting is applied to everything, it's a creative choice of the author, the AI needs instructions to know what to do, so it would need constant handholding, on the other hand RT uses simple physics to calculate how light bounced and NN to apply the light on surfaces.",Neutral
Intel,But the destructable environment and the water graphics and other things in Direct X 9 made high end pcs kneel as well.  I remember playing on my 9800gtx/+ with my Intel Q9300 quad core (lapped and oc'ed to 3.0ghz - EDIT: checked some old evga posts got it to 3.33ghz) with 2x4gigs DDR2 @1000mhz cas 5 trying to maintain a sustained 30fps at 900p resolution on my 1680x1050 monitor. And I oc'ed the crap out of that 9800gtx 835 mhz (cant recall if it was unlinked shadder or not now) core on blower air (won the silicon lottery with that evga card).  Tweaking settings was mostly user done and guided with old school limited forum help. Ahh the good old days of having lots of time during school breaks.,Neutral
Intel,"The equivalent of a 4090 at the time, 8800 ultra (768MB) got 7.5 fps at 1920x1200 very high quality. The other cards were not able to run it. Even the lowest tier last generation card runs this, even though it's at 5% speed.",Neutral
Intel,No and no again lol  The 8800gtx could do 1152x864 high and that was the top dog. DX9 cards could do that at medium but high shaders was like a 25fps average tops and that dropped into the teens on the snow level.   It took things like the gtx480 and HD 6970 to do 1920x1080 30fps max settings. That's before getting into Sandy Bridge being the first cpu that could sustain 40+ fps if the gpu power was there.   Crysis came during the core 2 duo/k8 athlon and first wave dx10 cards era and it took *2 more generations* of *both* gpus and cpus to do it some justice.,Neutral
Intel,"My 8800ultra was getting single digit fps at 1080p ultra, so CP isn't quite as demanding.",Neutral
Intel,Amd had a tessellation unit. It went unused but it was present,Neutral
Intel,"My fun story for PhysX was Mirrors Edge. I don't remember what GPU I had at the time but the game was pretty new when I played it. Ran fine for quite some time until one scene where you get ambushed in a building by the cops and they shoot at the glass. The shattering glass with PhysX turned on absolutely TANKED my framerates, like single digit. I didn't realize that the PhysX toggle was turned on in the settings. This was at a time when PhysX required a dedicated PCIe card in your system.   Once I turned it off it ran fine. Now I can run that game at ridiculous framerates without my system getting warm.",Positive
Intel,"I remember around about 2008 when companies like Asus and Dell were selling ""Physics Processing Units"" and some claimed that these would be commonplace in gaming machines just like Graphics cards had become 10 years previously.",Neutral
Intel,"Hardware accelerated physics (as in on the gpu), is different than what's going on the CPU.",Neutral
Intel,hobbies quaint consist aromatic political hat aback boat relieved crush   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*,Neutral
Intel,"People used to have ATI/AMD for main and a lower-end NVIDIA for PhysX.  When NVIDIA found this out they pushed out drivers that disabled PhysX on their cards if an ATI/AMD card was detected, limiting you to the intentionally piss-poor CPU implementation of PhysX.  Think about that crap.  One day everything's going fine for consumers, the next day NVIDIA decides they don't like how consumers are legitimately using their cards and gimps everyone, weaponizing a physics engine company that they bought in 2008.",Negative
Intel,"Oh damn, I forgot about those cards.  I wanted one so badly.",Positive
Intel,Remember when companies tried to sell physics cards lol,Neutral
Intel,>PhysX  It never was a dedicated Nvidia card - it was a [dedicated psysx](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/bfg-ageia-physx-card/) on which the tech later was bought by Nvidia and implemented in it's own GPU's.  But the things never became really populair.,Neutral
Intel,"This makes me wonder if we'll ever see something similar with Raytracing, where we get a 2nd GPU purely for RT, and then the main GPU just does all the other stuff. Would that even be possible?",Neutral
Intel,I remember when people had a dedicated PhysX card.,Neutral
Intel,The ray/path tracing in this case done by specialized hardware which has more room to grow faster.,Neutral
Intel,"I would, transistor shrinking isn't the only method of increasing performance, and honestly, these companies have to keep putting out better cards to make money.  There have been many breakthroughs over the last few years. I give it another 5 as both amd and nvidia are pushing ai accelerated ray tracing on their cards, nvidia is in the lead for now but amd will eventually catch up.",Positive
Intel,There is still a big leap possible since all lithography processes at the moment are hybrid euv and duv.   But the moment everything is done euv things will drastically slow down.,Neutral
Intel,"No those are just pennies in the pocket of Nvidia, but as the consequence you as the customer need to take a mortgage on a brand new GPU.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah the next 10 years are gonna be spent getting budget cards up to 4090 level performance, rather than bringing the bleeding edge to 5-10x the 4090 performance. As long as 4K is king, there’s not much incentive to do the latter.",Negative
Intel,"In 10 years we will be begging one of several thousand test-tube created Musk Family members for $200 so we can buy a cheeseburger.  But the jokes on them, we’re just gonna spend it on space crack.",Negative
Intel,"Never. Even if performance can be pushed that far, by the time it happens there won't be such a thing as a $200 graphics card anymore.",Negative
Intel,It's not happening unless the market crashes and they start focusing on offering good price/performance cards instead of bumping up prices every generation.,Negative
Intel,25 years,Neutral
Intel,"The software needs to run on hardware, right now it eats through GPU compute and memory.",Neutral
Intel,And sadly ended up with 450 Watt TDP to achieve that performance.,Negative
Intel,This. We'd be lucky to see more than 3 generations in the upcoming decade.,Positive
Intel,"Having seen a few newer games on relatively low resolution CRT display, I can't help but think it might come down to improved display tech and embedded scaling. Like DLSS3 features in the display instead of the GPU.",Neutral
Intel,Not with that attitude,Negative
Intel,Love how it's still gimped on memory size 😂,Positive
Intel,"They just need to render the minimum information needed , and let the ai do the rest",Neutral
Intel,"Don't get upscaling, to me it looks shite. Why spend hundreds or thousands on a GPU to not even run at native resolution.   It's something Nvidia are pushing because they've got a better version of it at the moment.  Maybe it'll improve, it's pretty much snake oil currently imo.",Negative
Intel,"Feels pretty good with 120 frames. Playing with a controller, i don‘t mind or even feel the input lag on a projector screen.",Positive
Intel,"It's mad that even with a 4090 running games at 4k, they still look less realistic than the low-res FMV sequences in The 7th Guest from 30 years ago.",Negative
Intel,"Do keep in mind that despite both being named the same, the devil's in the details. Movies use way more rays per scene and way more bounces too.   Path tracing in CP2077 shows temporal artifacts due to denoising, something that doesn't happen in movies. It is being improved with the likes of DLSS 3.5, but it is still quite off when compared to said movies.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind the systems that rendered toy story 1, costing upwards of like 300k IIRC, have less power than your cell phone today and were super delicate/finicky machines. There's a dude on youtube that got a hold of like the second best one that was made at the time and the machine honestly was really impressive for when it came out, but it pales in comparison to even a steam deck really.",Neutral
Intel,"> Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story  Toy Story didn't use path tracing though, A Bug's Life was Pixar's first movie to use ray tracing (not path tracing) and only for a few frames in the entire movie for specific reflections, they started using ray tracing more generally for Cars and I can't find exactly when they started using path tracing but it should be around the early 2010s which is also when the other Disney animation studios started using path tracing",Neutral
Intel,No it's not a miracle. Because it's downscaled a lot and also uses lower quality math and piggybacking on AI to make up for it. It's basically running through 3 layers of cheats to produce results that aren't that much better than just traditional raster.,Negative
Intel,"That’d be some next level consumerism, paying 1500$ minimum to turn on a single setting in a single game just to play it wayyyyy slower than you would otherwise",Negative
Intel,"Hell playing path tracing with my 2080ti at 25 FPS is still looks absolutely fantastic, I would absolutely play with pathtracing on a 4090 constantly. Idc dlss looks great with RR even at 1080p. I won’t upgrade for another year or 2 (just bought a phone so I’m broke right now)",Positive
Intel,4090 getting 60fps at 4k balanced dlss with no frame gen. 100 with frame gen. I can make it drop into the 20s if I stand right next to a fire with all the smoke and lightening effects or if I go to a heavily vegetated area it’ll drop to mid 40s. But it’s stay consistently at 55-65 and even goes Into the 90s if I head out of the city.   Haven’t tried it at quality or with dlss off though. May go do that now that it says only 19fps lol. Have to try it to see for myself,Neutral
Intel,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-dlss-35-tested-ai-powered-graphics-leaves-competitors-behind  Well it's so close (54fps) it's more like a 3080Ti or higher from 3000 series or a 4070TI + from 4000 series it seems? The old 3000 series is punching way above it weight vs the 7900xtx, which was meant to deliver similar RT performance to the 3090.. which it doesn't.",Neutral
Intel,At some point the RT pixels are so expensive that native resolution w/o DLSS and frame gen is just not gonna work for the time being.,Negative
Intel,"On the other hand, if you set the new DLSS 3.5 to performance (which you should in 4k), and just enable frame generation, you get 90+ in 4k with basically zero issues unless you pause to check frames.",Neutral
Intel,So rendering at 960p? Oof...,Neutral
Intel,"you take that back, I literally returned my 4080FE for a 4090 liquid x for more frames in cyberpunk.",Neutral
Intel,I almost see no difference.   And to see the little diffidence I need to take two screenshots and compare them.,Neutral
Intel,The game look is ruined on PT it makes everything look completely different.  Regular RT keeps the style of the game and performs good.,Negative
Intel,Dont use useless raytracing and you wont have any problems lol,Negative
Intel,"Because PC gaming blew up during a time where you could buy a mid range GPU and not need to upgrade for 5-6 years. Now those sample people buy a GPU, and 2 years later it can't run new games. At least that's my theory.",Negative
Intel,AW2 looks insane. Can't wait to play soon,Positive
Intel,Well the 3050 managed to hold with just 8GB while the 3070Yi crashed?,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, and people insisted on defending the configurations at launch lmao. The cards just won't be able to handle heavy loads at high resolution such as this game, regardless of how fucking insane the actual processing unit is.

Intel,My 3080 in shambles,Neutral
Intel,"It looks better than native even with fsr quality, the Taa in this game is shit",Negative
Intel,You dont need to increase raw performance. You need to increase RT performance.,Neutral
Intel,Imagine!,Neutral
Intel,DLSS unironically looks better than native TAA even at 1080p in this game because of the shit ghosting.,Negative
Intel,Only people who don't give a shit about high quality graphics don't care about ray tracing.,Negative
Intel,I got a stupidly good deal on the 4090(buddy won an extra one from a company raffle) and it just so happened my XTX was one of the cards suffering from the mounting issue on release.  Honestly very happy that all of that happened. Sure I would have been happy with the 7900xtx if I got a replacement but the 4090 just kinda blew me away especially with all the DLSS tech behind it.,Positive
Intel,"Nvidia used cp77 as a testing grounds for their dlss3 and rt tech, it'd no surprise it looks and performs relatively good, they literally partnered with cdpr for that.  Do not expect these levels of RT on most games anytime soon, probably in a couple years (with rtx 5000 series) the tech will be more mature and not as taxing for most cards, because needing to upscale and use framegen to get 60fps on an RT PT setting is kinda absurd.",Positive
Intel,">only then they become great features  Watch this happen with ""fake frames"" FSR3 in real time",Positive
Intel,>Ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick   This line was already false years ago when control launched. Now it’s just absurd,Negative
Intel,"There are a lot of new games that features Ray Tracing on them as of now, too bad most of them doesn't look as visually as good as they could be though as most of the time their RT effects are dumbed down or reduced to the point it's pointless.  But the thing is that wasn't the point even from the beginning, RT Overdrive on Cyberpunk is literally considered as a Technological showcase  What matters here IMO for all of us is PC platform in general is showcasing here what a real high-end computers can achieve beyond what current gen console can do, and they are showcasing it really well here on Cyberpunk with much better visuals and using plenty of tricks to make them more than playable, where they shouldn't be considering how much demanding they are over standard, that is impressive enough to me and shows a good sign of technological engineering innovation.   As what Bryan Catanzaro said on his interview on DF Direct, work smarter not harder, brute force is not everything, of course it still matters a lot but doing it alone is starting to become pointless just like how it is on real life.",Negative
Intel,Much more fps :) Newer generation cards have at least 50-60% better raster performance then prev gen.,Positive
Intel,The Evangelical Church of Native,Neutral
Intel,"So just to be clear, you don't like running games at native resolution? Because the purpose of DLSS is to improve performance by specifically not running at native resolution",Negative
Intel,Nice but ive been playing video games since the 70s and its Shit end off..,Negative
Intel,The future of frame generation is going to be huge. I can definitely see 360p frame rendering upscaled to 4k with 80% maybe even 90% of the frames being generated. All with equal to or even better visual quality.   A 20 FPS game like this will become a 100-200fps game.  We may be looking at the end of beefy graphics cards being required to play games. Just a good enough mid or low tier chip (granted 5-10 years from now) with frame generation might be enough.,Positive
Intel,"After 2.0, it's around 100""fps"". Just 60""fps"" (meaning with FG enabled) is far from being playable due to latency. You need at least 90""fps"" for playable experience.   Cyberpunk PT vs RT is a huge difference in terms of graphics, while DLSS Quality vs Balanced is really slim in comparison. What you say would be a really bad trade-off.   At 1440p DLSS Quality it's easily 120+""fps"" which is perfectly comfortable.",Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is greatly optimized. It looks fantastic for the hardware it asks. Starfield looks like game from 5 years that asks hardware from the future.,Positive

Intel,Pixar movies will sometimes take the better part of a day to render a single 4k frame on a render farm. So the fact that Cyberpunk takes more than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame in its path-tracing mode on a single 4090 clearly means that it's unoptimized garbage! /s  EDIT: Apparently people in this thread don't understand sarcasm (or don't understand how a path-traced game can take longer than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame with high-poly path tracing and still be optimized).,Negative

But, probably makes more sense to have it all on one chiplet, and just use many of the same chiplet for product segmentation purposes instead.   A separate PPU did make sense tho, I'm still annoyed that the nvidia ageia deal essentially kill the PPU in the cradle.

Intel,"Weird argument.  Traditional raster is cheats upon cheats upon cheats already.  In fact, all of the lighting entirely in raster is essentially cheats.",Negative
Intel,It will not work well/look good using a single frame worth of data either due to the low ray counts. Digital Foundry has shown Metro Exodus builds the lighting over ~20 frames or so and it seems like Cyberpunk is even more.

You need to cast 20-50x the rays to have enough data for a single frame but then you will be measuring the game performance by seconds per frame.,Negative
Intel,"RT looks significantly better than raster when it’s not just using simple reflections like a Far Cry 6. Raster is all cheats, the so called reflections are essentially rendering the scene or part of the scene being reflected in reverse then applying fake material effects to mimic metal, water, etc. Raster also takes HUNDREDS to thousands of person hours to get the fake reflections and lighting to look decent to good.

Intel,It's not a perfect way of measure but you can clearly see how (at least on Nvidia GPUs) the 8/10GB cards are way behind the >11Gb cards. Meaning you need 11 or 12GB of VRAM for this scenario which cripples the 3080 but not the 3060.  We said from the start these configurations are shit but no-one listened. There you go.,Negative

Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090). That's substantially faster than than how fast a 4090 runs Cyberpunk on the path tracing mode. Presumably, a less complex world helps, but they may also have implemented opacity micro maps, which I'm not sure if Cyberpunk has done in the 2.0 update.

Intel,It improves both looks and fps so it is a win win,Positive
Intel,"The issue with this is the inputs will only be registered at 20Hz. This would feel awful. The benefit of high FPS is having very low latency. This will just make it look smoother, not feel any better than 20 FPS",Negative
Intel,Considering there is no input on the generated frames that is going to feel horrible to play. Base FPS (incl DLSS) really still needs to be 50-60fps to feel playable imo.,Negative

Cyberpunk is demanding, and takes advantage of lots of tech available for upscaling and ray tracing and frame generation. AMD card’s currently do not match Nvidia’s in those categories, not even close. This us not an attempt to showcase Nvidia tech, but it does take advantage of it.",Positive
Intel,Because it's not about the flagship card. Only if the flagship can attain good performance at native then you will have headroom for lower end cards. Think about it. Of course upscaling is very important. But you also need some headroom to upscale.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah. I wanted better cooling performance after upgrading to the artic freezer 7 as well with those weird crapy plastic tension clips you pushed in manually, fearing bending them (worse than the stock intel cooler tension twist lock). Kept having random stability crashes until after i sanded it down for better thermals...Good old sandpaper and nerves of steel fearing an uneven removal of the nickel coating.  Was trying to maximize performance as back then core 2 duo and the extreme versions were king and they had way higher single core clocks and were easy to oc. Wanted the multhreaded for Crysis, LoL (back when you had to wait 5min+ to get into a game), BF2, and was eventually playing TF, Day of Defeat and Natural Selection.  My upgrade back then was to the Evga 560ti DS, which I ended up installing a backplate and  a gelid cooler. They had wayy better thermal tape/individual heatsinks for the memory/vram chips for the heat transfer. Evga back then told me if I ever needed to RMA it that I would just need to re-assemble it as it was shipped.

Intel,"There was more nuance to that ""bugfix"" than just ""it was a bug that got fixed""   Modders were able to re-enable the AMD/NVIDIA PhysX combo basically immediately via editing DLLs.  Not driver replacements, but actual DLL tweaks.  The speed at which modders were able to fix what NVIDIA ""broke"" combined with the public outrage put them in a funny legal spot.  If they continued with PhysX disabled and claiming it was a bug then the bug can easily be fixed, as shown by modders doing it first.  So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.  Obviously not many modern games use the GPU implementation of PhysX anymore and the performance difference between current GPU and CPU implementations are negligible anyway, but their intent at the time was clear once it was shown how quickly modders were able to get everyone back to normal.",Neutral

Intel,I like how you said: static image  because in motion upscaling is crappier,Negative
Intel,"It isn't a weird argument. Rasterization is premised on approximating reality, while RT is simulating it.  The extreme few amount of rays we trace right now, including bounces, means effects are often muted and the performance hit is enormous. To compensate, we're using temporal upscaling from super low resolutions *and* frame interpolation.  Temporal upscaling isn't without it's issues, and you know how much traditional denoisers leave to be desired. Even Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction leaves a lot to be desired; the thread on r/Nvidia shows as much, with ghosting, artifacts, etc. all over again. It's like the launch of DLSS 2.0.  All of that, for effects that are oftentimes difficult to perceive, and for utterly devastating traditional rasterization performance.",Negative
Intel,"It's a shame raster is so labor intensive, because it looks so interesting when done right.     I look at screenshots from cyberpunk, Raster / Ray Trace / Path Trace, and in most of them the raster just looks more interesting to me. Not constrained by what would be real physical lighting. The 100% RT render versions of old games like Quake gives a similar feeling.     But I imagine there will be more stylistic RT lighting over time, it saving a ton of labor is all things considered good, freeing it up for actual game design.",Positive

PT just looks and feels way more natural than just RT, when only raster literally looks like it was two different games from two different hardware generations.

Almost 70% still have 1080p.   CDPR made a VERY demanding game that looks GORGEOUS completely turned up. Modern hardware cannot handle it natively, it can’t. It is not a gimmick that a company has developed a superior technology that allows the game to be played at almost the same quality as native, significantly smoother and faster. You’re in denial if you think otherwise.  I’m not tied to either brand. I have an AMD CPU bc it was the best option for what I wanted, and a Nvidia GPU for the same reason. I care about RT, frame gen, all of that. The Witcher 3 still is my favorite game, and the entire reasoning for building a gaming PC over a console is graphical quality and speed while doing so. That game is absolutely gorgeous with RT on. Same with Cyberpunk, which I can enjoy thanks to DLSS.   You don’t care about those things? That’s fine, but it is solely a personal opinion.",Negative
Intel,"Yea well I was defining an arbitrary performance. It's not about having native performance.

The 4060ti gets 6.6 fps. Let's assume a next gen flagship is able to reach 60 fps at 4k. That would theoratically allow the 60ti card to reach around 20 fps.

Raster techniques have evolved a lot since then, and use raytracing in limited contexts, screen space reflections and ambient occlusion for example, but they're still operating with extremely limited data in narrow, isolated use cases, which is why they often look awful.

CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",Neutral

Intel,"> There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT.

Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.  Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts.

Now that Intel is working on dedicated GPUs they are going to eventually create APU like products, its just the natural outcome of producing both CPUs and GPUs.

And if that happens, unless FSR gets turned into a hardware specific tech like XeSS that falls into different techs depending on the GPU its running on, AMD will be murdered.

GPU utilization is the one that is far more useful for spotting bottlenecks, general performance observations are far more useful for tweaking.  Even Intel and co. will tell you that with modern processors and all the elements they contain as well as hyperthreading/SMT CPU utilization isn't a very useful stat anymore.

Intel,3050ti?  Gaming rip?  No,Neutral
Intel,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",Neutral

Intel,No!,Neutral
Intel,"This isn't exactly what I'd imagine hearing the words ""gaming rig"" but I'm glad you like it. Happy gaming!",Positive
Intel,Ignore the haters dude. Congratulations on your new gaming laptop. Gaming is something that is supposed to make us happy not cater to snobs. Not everyone needs 4k 60fps. If it satisfies your requirements it's the best rig for you. I have a Ryzen 5 2500u and I game on that so I am super happy for you.,Positive

Intel,"3050ti isn't really low end. And it will do for everything I need it for. I have an Xbox too for the most modern stuff.  People think that everyone has to have 4k 60fps in every game these days and not everyone needs or wants that, especially in a first machine.",Positive
Intel,"for you maybe, this fits my needs perfectly.",Neutral
Intel,"Yup I am more than happy!  I've only ever had and played with integrated graphics on any other laptop I've had so this is a huge step for me.

Intel,Can we just toss random darts at tech words and numbers to assign a different naming scheme to each and every different Intel Product?,Neutral
Intel,"This isn't a ""halo"" product. An upgrade to Arrow Lake/Lunar Lake when it comes to iGPU, but not Strix Halo. It won't cost as much as well.",Neutral
Intel,look forward to new APUs,Positive
Intel,Wait for Nova Lake AX. It will have 48 GPU cores instead of 4/8/12.,Neutral
Intel,Likely will be worse since it has only 1/3 the power usage and significantly smaller chip size.,Negative
Intel,"also why is everything in a lake. like really that's the last place you want your chips to be.  and why is it 255k, 285k and so on instead of just 250k and 280k.  and why is it arc xe3 and not just xe3 ahh  so many weird conventions really. no consistency at all. just pure confusion.  apple and nvidia get it right too, it's really not that hard.",Negative
Intel,"'Strix Halo' is lees about being a halo product, because it’s just an AMD internal naming scheme for the set of specific APU products. APUs that will follow 'Strix Halo' will be called 'Gorgon Point'. Since 'Strix Halo' is already out and the Panther Lake in question is about to come out it might be better to compared it to the next AMD 'Gorgon Point' APU line?

Intel,Really? This should be good for Intel in 2026.,Positive
Intel,They are like 20% more efficient.  You are talking about 200% more efficient if it hits the same performance.    They might as well make it a mobile chip if that is how good it is. Would be great on phones.  Would be better than most pcs right now on 5W envolope.,Positive

Intel,"Yes, Strix Point lives *alongside* Strix Halo. Strix Point is already out, and came out *before* Strix Halo at that. It is not the followup to Strix Halo.",Neutral
Intel,You are right. I meant 'Gorgon Point'.,Neutral
Intel,"Gorgon point is just a refresh of strix point. These terms mean less in the next gen anyway as the follow on products have quite different names. Medusa point isn't really the successor to gorgon point, for example.",Neutral

Intel,Where did you hear that it was cancelled?,Neutral
Intel,"We are supposed to get B60s also but they will likely be very limited and part of Battlematrix.

Intel,"Battle mage is not a 0 margin product...  I know how much silicon cost etc due to my job. Believe me there is at least %30 gross margin in Battlemage and that is assuming somehow Intel got a worse price compared to my small ass company.     It's not profitable due to amount of R&D it takes to develop it, Intel earns a significant chunk for each Battlemage sold. They are simply not as greedy as Nvidia and AMD to earn market share.",Negative
Intel,Dude XE3 even has some test shipment reports etc. It's too late to cancel.   Sure if it's not good maybe we will only see B580 replacement.    But it's literally impossible and stupid to cancel it right now. Especially given how much gross profit they made from B580,Negative

Intel,"You don't even know that?   Lip Bu has been hiring gpu designers not firing them.   Most of the Cuts are from foundry side and slightly from gaudi side.    Intel if anything is focusing on gpus to create AI inference gpus.    Only potential explanation would be only cutting consumer graphics but that doesn't make much sense as they are very familiar.      You should check your sources, Lip Bu would cut 14A before he cuts Inference gpu side.",Neutral

Well yes, if they cancel a project, and I know they have, I'll say they cancelled it. The way Intel can convince me to say otherwise is by... not cancelling projects. And you *do* realize they haven't talked about client dGPUs past BMG in many, many months, right? It's not like Intel's really denying anything.  I'm not sure what you're looking for here. Should I lie and pretend not to know what I do? To what end? It's not like Intel's harmed by me saying they cancelled such a project. That's not something you can keep a secret indefinitely, and anyone who *really* cares already knows.  > Also just look at job listings, there is many for gpu development.

Intel,"Intel have not claimed there to be upcoming Celestial, or more Battlemage or anything like it. How did their silence convince you of anything?",Neutral
Intel,Think pretty easy naming. Any X infront just automatically means better iGPU,Positive
Intel,"Looks pretty snappy at \~75% faster than the top-end LNL chipset and this is with pre-release drivers.  Granted TDP is probably higher.  If they get the drivers cleaned up then it might release a bit higher which makes it a viable (though still materially weaker) thin and light XX50 dGPU model alternative some some of the market.

Intel,"Nice to see the G14 with an Intel CPU. Thought the lineup was AMD only tbh, while the larger G16 laptops get Intel.",Positive
Intel,"Panther Lake 12 Xe3 performance looks great to match RTX 3050 laptop performance because the entire chip only draw half power of RTX 3050. Seems like using 18A BPD really paid of to reduce CPU consumption by a lot with the helps of Tsmc N3E for iGPU.    Also it's so weird to see Asus Zephyrus G14 with Intel chip, usually it always has Amd CPU paired with Nvidia GPU. I heard G14 is pretty popular gaming laptop but this laptop during full load can use 120w+ power.    Using Panther Lake 12 Xe3 will makes this laptop looks even more appealing because it reduces power requirements from 120w+ to 45w but still giving about the same GPU performance which is insane. This is a massive game changer for people who use laptop as portable gaming machine and to those who travel a lot. I can totally understand why Asus this time use Panther Lake for G14.",Positive

It's possible that Xe3 is simply treated more like RDNA in this benchmark, and that the Xe2 140V is unfairly biased towards in that way. If that is the case, the 890M and 8060S may be better metrics to base off, and we do see over 50% gains for a 50% wider GPU than the 890M.  It's also possible this is a power-limited scenario. Like for like on TDP, this would be a solid improvement given the GPU both has to be moved off-tile compared to Lunar Lake, and has twice as many CPU cores to fight for power.  This could be pre-release drivers not getting the true 100% out of the hardware or silicon with non-final clocks still being tuned. The point is there's no way to know for sure.",Neutral

Intel,"they're keeping their jobs because this is technically better than the past. back in the day you'd have model numbers exclusive to a retail store, much less specific to an OEM, because businesses wanted to feel like they got a bespoke deal.   These days the SKU naming is mostly for accounting purposes, while the ""real"" naming decisions are made by the OEMs. basically most people are buying the Thinkpad/Yoga/ROG ""brand"" rather than the specific processor model, which only a much smaller crowd bothers to comprehend.

Intel,"e cores are surprisingly powerful now, and games are getting more multithreaded. It might be better to spread them out over 8 less power hungry cores than 4 P cores and then spill over to the slower cores. Especially in a laptop environment where efficiency matters and the GPU is usually holding back gaming performance so much that CPU performance is really not that important.  In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread. But most importantly, it doesn't do so evenly. Maybe you don't need something assigned to e cores, or the e core task is light and doesn't hold up the other threads. Then things will run at the pace of the P cores, but every now and then you'll have a slowdown.",Neutral
Intel,Wonder if there's some energy star requirements.,Neutral
Intel,"Shouldn't be. That's what the math has always said.  As soon as software can scale to ""many"" cores, the tradeoffs that go into single powerful P style cores are a bad deal. Both frequency and sequential optimizations (like multi-level branch prediction) scale poorly.  Gaming benchmarks tend to have a really strong feedback loop that favors last gen hardware design though. So seeing the benefits to E cores for gaming requires 1.) e-cores exist for a while 2.) some games optimize for them.  Long term, an optimal Intel-style processor design will look something like 4 ""legacy"" P cores + dozens of E cores.",Negative

Intel,"Really should focus on the Main/Sub thread part. Most games will usually only load up 1-3 cores, with the rest of the cores only used for incidental workloads with lower priority and sync requirements (Multithreading is hard yo, Multithreading with latency requirements is mindnumbing).  This makes plenty of games very suitable for the P/E architecture, as long as you have enough P cores for the Main threads, the E cores will be perfectly sufficient.",Neutral

I'm not sure, if possible, provide a review/video which shows that UE5 scale with more cores/threads, so far, it seems that it is limited at 8c/16t - big channels rarely add UE5 games to their CPU benchmarks, but I found Remnant 2,[ and it doesn't show any benefits](https://youtu.be/3n537Z7pJug?t=1056) of more than 8 cores.  I heard that ""games are getting more multithreaded"" like 4-5 years ago, and in most cases, it wasn't true, with more than 8c/16t almost no games scale on CPU-side, and even when they do, in most cases it's a minor improvement over 8c/16t configuration, like 1-3%.",Negative
Intel,"UE5 by default does not support multithreading well. actually I don't think async shader is even considered a default feature yet despite being added two years ago. Only the editor compilation step uses all threads, but it doesn't need to react to user input so it would be more surprising if it didn't use all threads.  If you're seeing good thread use in a UE5 game is thanks to the developer breaking up work with their own engine changes.",Negative

Intel,"12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark, like actually within error margins next to 7800X3D despite being an older platform with half the L2 of raptor lake and lower clock speed than even 7700X, shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much. Yeah 9950X should outperform it technically I guess but the split L3 between two CCDs probably holds back the advantage of having more cores.  Yeah sadly there's no benchmark for Bannerlord. But supposedly it does disperse its tasks to plenty of threads.   Here's some benchmarks showing core and thread usage in a few games. While the benchmark tool doesn't get into the details of how those software behave obviously, but at least according to the graphs some games like Tarkov really suck at distributing its tasks to several cores but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.

Intel,">12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark  It's because Creation Engine 2 worked better with Intel hardware until AM5 X3D chips, and 12900K great result in this test just shows that it's still a good CPU with 8 Performance cores, not that it's core count matters in any significant way - for example, 7700X delivers identical performance with lower core count/threads.  >lower clock speed than even 7700X  Clock speeds can't be compared between different architectures, different architecture = different efficiency, what matters is IPC.  >shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much  [here's a better example where more intel CPUs are present in Starfield test](https://youtu.be/XXLY8kEdR1c?t=29m5s), as you can see, increased core count/threads past 8 performance cores and 16 thread's is meaningless and won't provide any noticeable performance improvements, 6 faster P-cores on Intel 14600K provided better result than slower 8 P-cores on 12900K.   Going from 7950X to to 7700X results in 5 FPS loss, which is like 2-3% less FPS, and it's mostly because of lower clock speed(5.7Ghz Vs 5.4Ghz boost).   >but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.  That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.  Edit: typo",Positive
Intel,"Well you said that games are optimized for 8/16 and yet gn bench shows 7600X only gets 3-4 less avg fps than 7700X in baldurs gate 3, a highly multithreaded game, it has better 0.1% lows even, though I'm sure that one is a contained incident since BG3 is very dynamic and hence results are not always repeatable. Same with Starfield.   That's because in video games, core count matters less than how fast the CPU can access or manipulate very dynamic types of data in a random memory address.    X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"". They're going to win in old or new games, and they're winning in games because they have a large buffer of low latency data. Not winning in productivity benchmarks because productivity is about processing matters more than accessing data, and its more easily multithreaded too in many cases.    But having more cores is still more advantageous in software and games that can occupy them.",Neutral

Point of discussion was to prove that games are using more than 16 threads or they're not - it seems like you overestimated Starfield, UE5 reliance on core count/threads and most games care about 16 threads at most.   >core count matters less  Yes, that's why I replied to that person and asked him to provide me with modern AAA games which are more ""multi-threaded"" now than AAA games a few years ago, I feel like what he ""observes"" is what he wants to believe, and not something that actually happened with optimization in games.  >X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"".  AMD sells 9950X3D, best productivity and gaming CPU, if you really need both(workloads/gaming) it's the optimal way, for an average user, only benefit of E-cores is lower power draw when idle - but they do matter more if you need those workloads, I agree, but we discussed gaming performance and core reliance.",Neutral

Add cache to the chip for the iGPU to use (to make up for the poor bandwidth they get from LPDDR5, even with a wider bus)  If they don't do this then the chip (which again won't fit in their default socket) will be massively bandwidth constrained to the degree that it's pointless.  Basically, do all the stuff that Strix Halo did.  Issue is Strix Halo didn't sell very well, the idea is a proof of concept and the concept needs faster memory to really work well.  LPDDR6 might help a lot at getting these big chip ideas from a XX60 level to a XX70 level, but they still require a lot of expensive chip work and a new motherboard design custom to the big socket.

Intel,"They pushed the 6 core parts too hard as ""good budget parts"" for too long to not keep using them as their reference...  Even when we're seeing games that now have strokes when they don't have 8 cores to play with.",Negative
Intel,"possibly. Honestly weird as hell to not through in intel cpu results with the same gpus so they can see if it's a all cpu overhead issue, or an issue with amd cpus with intel gpu. Like even one game if intel/amd gave about the same performance you could likely rule it out somewhat.  Also weird to say they fixed it if by the sounds of it to say it's fixed if a very limited number of games were updated to work better in also seemingly limited scenarios. That's more like finding a specific problem on a specific game they were able to improve rather than an underlying fix which if implemented should help everywhere.",Negative

Intel,"But that's now how games utilize CPU's.  What you get from games is usually 1 main thread that takes up one big core, then many less intense threads, that may or *may not* utilize the other cores, and to varying degrees.

Intel,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Neutral

The main games that will benefit, however, are those few which don't schedule properly by default and therefore have poor results with the 12-core and 16-core X3D parts compared to the 8-core part.

AMD,"That's well within the margin of error.

Additionally, it should be faster overall than a normal 9950X3D if you run power limited to say, 150W, since the 3D cache chips tend to be quite a bit more power efficient below 80W per CCD.",Neutral
AMD,"Gaming is likely the worst possible example of how this addition can be taken advantage of, simply because of gamers' habits:  - Gaming is typically done on Windows, an OS with task scheduling so silly, it's still a pain in the ass to use long existing server CPUs with it exposing many cores. Cache-aware scheduling is experimental even on Linux, Windows just won't catch up any soon.  - Games are incredibly sloppily written, and typically only optimized until the performance is considered good enough on the most common setups. Windows doesn't even offer tools to mitigate bad strategies like creating tons of threads beyond the point of reasonable scaling, unlike tools offered by Linux like a cgroup with only the X3D CCD being visible, or similarly Wine being instructed to limit the visibility of cores not desired to be used. Letting the game see 32 hardware threads, resulting in multiple layers of abstractions create 32 software threads each, and just confining them them to a single CCD with something like Process Lasso just doesn't compare.  - Even with a good scheduler, what's the point of having 2 higher performance CCDs for the use case of one performance sensitive task with many background tasks the user doesn't even care about much? Typically there's only one game running the user is focusing on, and background bloatware will spill out of the extra cache anyway.",Negative

AMD,I turned the X3D upside down,Neutral
AMD,"The lower cache is why the requests have to be made frequently.  You have 96MB of L3 on one CCD, and 32MB on the other CCD.  If a thread on the latter needs data cached on the former, it will retrieve it over the IF link, which is slower than a local cached read, but still faster than a DRAM access (which is why the request is made in the first place).  That will then be the newest line of memory, being stored in the L1/L2 of the core that requested it, kicking out the oldest line into the L3, which in turn kicks out the oldest L3 line.  When that latter evicted line is needed again, it will have to be refetched.  It's still likely in the L3 of the first CCD, due to that being triple the size, so it will be requested over the IF link again.    But if both cache sizes are the same, then that scenario will happen much less often.  Both CCD's will end up having mostly the same cache lines stored locally, and only if the data is invalidated (which won't happen to most of the read-only memory involved with running a game) would there need to be a cross-CCD transfer for the same cache line.  There's still room for particular code to not run all that well in that scenario, but it's likely uncommon.  Worst case scenario, you just relegate such a game to a single CCD using *Process Lasso* or some other means of managing process affinity on the fly.  All of this is obvious when you compare the performance of non-X3D 16-core parts to the equivalent 8-core part.  In nearly all games, there's no real difference.  Only occasionally does the performance suffer on the dual-CCD part.  It's in those scenarios where a dual-X3D processor might not do as well, though there are certainly other variables that affect the outcome.",Neutral
AMD,"This is Reddit. We don't do that here, though in hindsight it is a bit embarrassing when the article is so short...   It's a good point and I guess it will perform a bit better in WoW, but it won't be the difference maker between running WoW at an awful performance level and a completely acceptable one.",Negative
AMD,"If your other tasks also like the cache, it makes sense.  Or if you want to lower the power down to 150W for all-thread tasks, 3D2 should start consistently beating the 9950X3D since the latter won't have a clock speed advantage and the former will keep the cache advantage",Neutral
AMD,Huh. Interesting idea. But there's diminishing returns for larger caches. The first additional cache tripled the size. The second wouldn't even double it. Wouldn't expect too much improvement.,Neutral
AMD,"I was strictly talking about the actual listed numbers. AMD will also go above if you let it.  The 230W has nothing to do with PBO. Its the default PPT set for 170W TDP parts, they \*will\* draw 230W when maxed out under default settings. (I'm also fairly sure most boards don't ship with a modified PBO enabled anyway.)  AMD's listed TDP is a calculation based on various factors. Intel's listed TDP is just their base power limit (which as you've noted they don't tend to stick to). The numbers are not comparable because they're based on different things and in AMD's case is almost entirely unrelated to power draw.",Neutral

AMD,"Is it defined anywhere? So far there has been no 200W TDP part.  If PPT is ""just"" 240 W, then it uses a smaller ratio to TDP than the other TDP grades (it's usually around 1.35x).",Neutral
AMD,"Intel's TDP is just base power since 12th gen. Its not arbitrary. AMD's TDP is a (relatively complex) formula, effectively detached from either its base or boost power draws, it also is not impacted by their boost algorithm. They're not comparable numbers. (Edit: Also nothing is tuned based off TDP for either company.)  For this discussion specifically PPT is the number to care about on AMD's side. For Intel its just the boost power that was brought up in the other comment. (Outside of overclocking where none of these numbers matter.)",Neutral

Gen X (46 to 59) and older Millennials (\~36 to 45), not just boomers, might think the same about the young today, especially since it is predominantly this cohort currently with kids age 10 to 20 that know that their own kids have no clue.   I can guarantee that most (well over half) of kids in high school have no idea what a floppy disk is outside of maybe a documentary or museum.  Sure, they might recognize the icon and remember someone told them it is a floppy disk, and maybe some even have seen a 3.25"" one from \~ 20 years ago since those aren't all that old.  But knowing what something is and knowing how to use it aren't the same thing.  It doesn't make someone ""better"" or ""special"" if they used those things, I don't know where you got that idea, it just means that tech is changing rapidly.  I know what a Model T was, but I would be an idiot if I claimed to be as knowledgeable as my great-grandparents who drove across the country in one.  And on the contrary to your insinuation that boomers are somehow the tech elitists here, some older boomers are borderline tech illiterate, though by now the vast majority are fine and some obviously have been using PCs for 50 years. It was the generation before that that was often almost inept with tech (though my 92 year old Grandma is totally tech fluent, my grandfather on the other side couldn't figure out how to use a mouse and keyboard to write a letter, got frustrated, and pulled out the typewriter, and had trouble with all but the most simple tasks on his phone so we had to buy one of those old people flip-phones with big buttons).   Gen X was probably the first ""whole generation"" exposed to digital technology from an early enough age to expect everyone in that cohort to recognize all these things not just from references, but from likely using them at least once and being fully tech exposed and literate.

In either case, the 'cacheable size' is closer to the total cahce of a single CCD than the combined number from the point of view of any single application thread.   However, if different threads are doing vastly different things (common for servers, not as true for games) the many caches across CCDs is more helpful.",Neutral
AMD,"Usually bigger cache means, larger distances and it also adds more ways and sets in the cache’s lookup table. Moving from a 32MB to 64MB cache atleast on zen3 added about 10ns on average. Eventually there has to be a limit where the increase will not help at all...maybe",Neutral

AMD,depends on the implementation.  eDRAM made broadwell often faster than skylake up until skylake got faster DRAM. Some of this was bandwidth.  3D vcache solves a lot of issues related to trace length though... just go UP (i.e. stack 2 or 16 layers of vcache on top of each other instead of just 1 similar to what's done with HBM for dRAM).,Neutral

More often than not, the 16-core part is faster because it has better bins and higher frequency.  There are a few more titles that do worse with a 7950X3D versus a 7800X3D, simply because the game gets scheduled on the CCD without V-cache, but that's not the same comparison.  In those examples, the 7950X3D is still faster than the 7950X.  It would just work better with proper scheduling (which can be done with *Process Lasso* or some other affinity controlling software).

AMD,Thanks,Positive
AMD,Broadwell's cache was in large part meant to relieve bandwidth pressure on the DRAM for the iGPU. Cut the number of requests to DRAM by half and good things happen.     eDRAM is on the order of 10-100x higher latency than sRAM.   It's a different tech with the primary benefit being that it's cheaper.   It's less about capacity and more about cell structure.,Positive

In many cases, these instances aren't going to be fully utilized, and having an instance that costs less is going to be preferred over one that has higher peak CPU performance.  When autoscaling or using spot instances, instance availability can also be a consideration, and using slower instances may be preferable over faster instances that start throwing errors about a lack of capacity when you need to scale out in a hurry.  Certainly in this case, if I had a workload that was heavily CPU-limited, I'd be defaulting to the AMD option (and that has been the case for many years now).

AMD,Because cost can change very easily.  It's usually more helpful to know the raw comparable performance and do the cost adjustment yourself because rarely is your cost goinng to match that you see in a review.,Neutral
AMD,Or they simply needed different options and how these were configured was mainly due to timing of setup. Or maybe small differences in how smt works with each.

There is zero competition in the 28W class but it doesn’t perform better than the Intel/AMD iGPUs if you configure them to pull 70W.  You can configure the TDP up in the Intel and AMD SOCs, if you do so, they’ll perform about equal but then draw around 70W.   About the M5:   Under pure processor load, the processor can briefly consume 30.5 W before stabilizing at 27.5 W. The graphics card draws a maximum of 18-19 W.   About the AMD/intel SOCs:  The Intel chips are usually configured in the 45 W to 115 W range while it can be 30 W to 80 W in the case of AMD. What's important to note is that these CPUs require more than 70 W to achieve these results.   These statements don’t necessarily contradict each other. It’s far ahead of any competition in terms of power classes but with unlimited power the competition can match the performance or even outperform it.   The power class determines the design.  Thin and light notebooks just cannot provide proper cooling for a 70W part, especially not on battery power.  But big heavy notebooks that require constant power connections can still outperform it.

The AMD 890M shares the same die but it's a largely separate device internally connected to the CPU via a PCIe x8 link.

This part is a little funny, though:  >However, Apple trades this performance advantage with increased power consumption. Although the single-core efficiency remains roughly the same as the M4 generation (and still significantly better than the rest of the competition), the increased consumption also leads to slightly shorter battery runtimes.   Problematically, NBC did **not** test energy, which is what they *should* test to correlate the CPU and the battery life. Batteries store energy, not power.

Why does the age of the bin matter? This needs the longer answer:  1. LPDDR5X-9600, when it first launched [as LPDDR5T by SK Hynix](https://news.skhynix.com/sk-hynix-develops-worlds-fastest-mobile-dram-lpddr5t/) in Jan 2023, was fabbed on the 1α node.

Like CPUs & GPUs, DRAM is binned, but even more so than logic. And especiallly LPDDR5, all bins adhere to JEDEC, thus it's unlike higher-clocked DDR5 desktop DIMMs that can be cheap bins →  XMP/EXPO + pumped voltage + overclocked → guaranteed to be higher power. Desktop users don't need to care, tbh. 3. So higher-clocked LPDDR5 does **not** *need* to consume more power, especially as that bin matures. LPDDR5X-9600 is almost three years old now, which is ancient for a LPDDR bin.  If this was LPDDR5X-10700 that is very new, maybe slightly more power, but LPDDR5X-9600 alone is not the primary reason for M5's higher power consumption.",Neutral

AMD,"I'm not really a fan of the X3D circle jerk because in practical gaming scenarios, a 7600x will perform nearly or exactly the same as a 9800X3D when GPU bound - the only real scenario where the extra cache makes a significant difference is if you're going wild with the frame rate with an understressed GPU i.e. playing CS:GO. And unless you're getting the holy grail 9950X3D, you're trading off some theoretical productivity performance for theoretical gaming performance.  Not to say X3D isn't great, but there's money that can be allocated to GPU instead of CPU. If you're already going all-out with a 5090, sure why not splurge. But a lot of people build to a budget. For the price of a 9800X3D/7800X3D + 5070 for example, you can instead get a 7600x/9600x + 5070 Ti. Or use that budget for more storage or more RAM, or a nice case, whatever to best suit your needs.

If you could hit a cpu bottleneck in RT its not going to be with a modern high end cpu.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah it increases CPU load, but it's not nearly as substantial than the load increase going from raster to RT, so you'll be GPU bottlenecked ... not even GPU bottlenecked ... bottlenecked by the RT calculations, which is done by separate hardware inside your GPU  Just as seen here in the CP benchmark",Negative
AMD,"Because the CPU load for RT and PT should be the same. The CPU expensive part of RT is BVH building, and enabling one RT effect enables it, and the other RT effects just reuse the same BVH.",Neutral

AMD,That’s one main reason to avoid it when your target is gaming; more cost and potential issues for no gaming gain.  And there’s a pretty thin demographic that would take a 9950X(3D) over a Threadripper or M-CPU Mac. Especially if a paycheck is on the line.,Negative
AMD,"Without any upscaling at all on a 9800X3D, testing maxed out RT settings? Yeah I'm not surprised. But I don't think those are exactly ideal settings to be running. They just run those because these are benchmarks and they're testing the GPU, not the CPU.  In Cyberpunk, Hardware Unboxed did a good settings breakdown when Phantom Liberty dropped and they figured out pretty fast how HARD your performance drops off, with little to no visual benefit, from the higher RT settings (Minus path tracing).  Seeing a test with quality DLSS and more fine tuned RT settings, tested over a variety of sections would yield CPU hits based on my experience. I was seeing HUGE hits in some sections, like the parade mission.",Negative
AMD,An 8% difference in performance is still significant. People make purchasing choices with less than that difference in performance.  They are also testing Ultra ray tracing where they really should have used RT low which still has significant RT cpu load but give more GPU headroom to actually see a differerence. I've tested RT low at 1080p on my 9070xt and have seen 20-30% loss in performance where my 5700X3D was already at 100% usage with RT off and GPU still wasn't maxed out.,Neutral
AMD,"You can hit it with DLSS at 1080p. Path Tracing hits the CPU performance hard, dropping down to the 80s to 120s depending on the scene. That isn't a limit that you'd reasonably reach in this generation,  but in two or three it might matter.",Neutral

Even just enabling ANY RT in Cyberpunk on my 5070ti + 5700X3D system, no matter how low my other settings were, would bring my CPU bottleneck from the 180's to the 120's for my frame rate. Any form of PT would drop it to more like 80-90, even with insane levels of upscaling and only 50% GPU usage lol.",Neutral
AMD,You can clearly see with RT Ultra the cpu is generating more frames than with PT at 4k  with dlss performance (1080p render resolution) while being cpu limited in both cases (albeit with PT its bounces back and forth between cpu and gpu limited) https://youtu.be/BqtRPViQSoU?si=F49xGAaenXFFl4W7,Neutral

AMD,"That is not an argument anybody is making.  The fact is though if you want to run deeper in Stellaris with good simulation performance you need a stronger CPU, if you want to run more AI empires and a larger map beyond the late game crisis you need a stronger CPU to prevent it from grinding to a crawl.  PoE2 is notoriously demanding at the moment. It really hits the CPU hard and that is why reducing the number of sound channels can improve FPS because it takes load off of the CPU.  WoW in end game raids is also very CPU demanding.  So while they are playable on weaker hardware the experience is worse.",Negative
AMD,9950x3d is 22% more expensive than 285k in the US right now while 285k is only 15% more expensive than a 9800x3d making them closer in price.,Neutral

AMD,"That would require a special benchmark to locate a consistently and repeatably CPU bound section of the game, probably wouldnt reflect at all in a normal benchmark pass as HWUB do in these tests.",Neutral
AMD,Because if there were a significant CPU bottleneck the difference in performance between GPUs would become smaller. like 1080p non RT benches show in most games.,Neutral
AMD,This was my experience with 5700x3d and 9070xt RT low. HWU using RT ultra instead of low was a big mistake if they wanted to show a difference in CPU instead of a GPU bottleneck.,Negative
AMD,"That doesn't change anything about the argument.  You have less FPS because the GPU takes longer to calculate ""infinite"" bounces vs limited bounces but the BVH that rays traverse stay the same",Neutral

If you play very niche game like stellaris - go ahead and buy, but vast majority of people play other games. Now lets compare it to GPU market where everything is bad, everything is overpriced and people can’t justify 100$ priceup to gain like 30% performance (5060ti->5070 for example), while it’s totally fine to pay 450$ instead of 130-170$ for CPU to gain 20% performance.

AMD,"Yeah, intel has a hard time selling them. Makes them somewhat more reasonable priced. Still feels like comparing two different segments if you know what I mean.",Neutral
AMD,"Well if they did a benchmark pass in the parade mission it would show, it's not like that mission is any less repeatable than doing a pass anywhere else in the game right? It's not the combat or something that was CPU intensive, just walking around was. They don't need to really locate those sections manually if the community already knows about them, it's why these benchmarks generally evolve over time to find more fitting areas to do passes in.  The really repeatable tests are the actual built-in benchmarks, which they don't use because they didn't find them to be CPU demanding, at least in cyberpunk they weren't.

I dont want it to be missing instructions that even a 11th gen CPU had, and every AMD also has. I dont want a 1kg AMD Strix Halo laptop, macbook or even ipad to be faster in some tasks (running LLM) than my big ass watercooled monster Intel Desktop computer, just because some marketing manager at Intel thinks this is only reserved to server CPU's. Its simply ridiculous and unacceptable. I will simply buy something else. Its 2026. How hard can it be to give AVX512 to consumers, Intel?!?  I don't have AMD stock and have also bought intel forever. 10th gen, 11th gen, 12th gen and 14th gen, I am **the** enthusiasts that upgrades every generation or 2 to a new i9, and who recommends computers to dozens of other persons. But I'm at this point where I don't understand how it's possible that ipad's are faster in some tasks than honkin' donkin' water-cooled Intel CPU's. Progress in the PC world has been completely absent. Why would I recommend an Intel X86 computer with Windows11 (puking emoji) instead of an Ipad to anyone again? And for me as an enthusiast, where's my quad-channel memory and AVX512, Intel?  Without innovation, Intel will go bankrupt. You rarely see desktop computers in the real-world. I'm convinced in 5 to 10 year most of laptops also will switch away from x86, and unfortunately the DIY PC building will die. There is no reason for 'normal' people to get a Desktop or even laptop.

AMD,"There's a difference between 'demanding' and 'can optionally make use of', though.  And of course there's the chicken and egg situation in general, which can hold back support for newer instructions, which means that lots of applications MIGHT have been faster if it was simply better supported in hardware earlier.  And so whether you want to pick up Nova Lake or not, we should still be a bit annoyed if it doesn't support AVX-512.  Especially for something coming late 2026.  Are they seriously this behind in implementing AVX10.2?",Negative

The 4 core barely runs Windows and a web browser and disabling theming (as much as you can, anyway) still leads to a lot of stuttering.  I would like to echo the 5960x/HEDT lineup comment above.

AMD,"Oh yeah it matters. The longer the user base remains without AVX512 and APX, the longer game developers will wait before using those extensions in any meaningful way.",Neutral
AMD,It matters for PS3 games. Also next gen consoles will use Zen 6 which will likely have avx512.,Neutral
AMD,"Plenty of uses for AVX in games. Physics systems, multi-point collision logic, things like wind and wave simulation all benefit greatly from SIMD support.",Positive
AMD,"No. You still require the hardware on the chip to implement the instructions. API support for them just affects how easy it is to write code that targets them. Currently hand-written SIMD code uses intrinsics, which are functions that map directly to individual instructions, so you are effectively still writing assembly code. The new API will abstract those details away, but the instruction set to target will still be fixed and chosen at compile time like it is now.",Neutral
AMD,"This is an abstraction, if anything this will make it easier to write simd code and require the greatest and latest extensions.",Positive

AMD,"It matters for an emulator that barely nobody uses so that’s a fairly insignificant point. Actually, have you looked at benchmarks for that emulator lately? Avx512 doesn’t seem to be a major performance point now.   I used to benefit a lot of avx512 when my work involved a lot of vectorized computation. Now it matters very little to me because it doesn’t really increase general performance. Same will be true in future games.",Negative
AMD,"1) Fine, physics. But that's just a fraction of total compute time.      2) Those things you named are done through compute shaders nowadays. CPU's throughput is pretty pathetic compared to GPU's. Also when you want to render these, you want the memory to reside on the GPU anyway.  Most CPU resources are going to be wasted on things like AI, data streaming, culling etc. None of which really benefit from AVX, unless they're built with DoD in mind, which almost no-one ever does anymore.  It's sad reality. Devs just don't want to spend their time optimizing, when users just can buy a better PC or use tricks to hide performance deficits.",Negative

AMD,There is no games that need it. None. Some games can sometimes make use of it for a small benefit.,Neutral
AMD,I'm the emulator how much avx512 matters depends on how heavily the game maximized it's use of the cell CPU. I am not aware of avx512 no longer benefiting PS3 games.   It's possible Sony and MS ask AMD to somehow remove avx512 support of their next consoles if they don't see it as useful but usually only Sony does this and they do it for GPU features not CPU.

AMD,">1) Fine, physics. But that's just a fraction of total compute time.  Unfortunate, should be increased focus on this.",Neutral
AMD,"You could do that, but having that check every time a SIMD instruction is run would be a big performance bottleneck. Instead what can be done is to check the CPU feature support when the program starts up, and dynamically modify the code to select the available instruction set. But there's no way to do this portably (as far as I'm aware), and it still requires the developers to write and maintain duplicate code for the different instruction sets they want to support.",Negative
AMD,"There are better ways to do so in some compilers than doing manual runtime if/else checks.

AMD,What's your point? SIMD is a performance/throughput enhancing feature. If it wasn't for legacy hardware there'd be no reason not to use it.,Neutral
AMD,"I doubt it's that expensive, even if you were doing a single 256 bit instruction. Definitely not to void the performance gain. If Java can do it, so can C/C++.",Neutral
AMD,There are also options like compiling a shared library several times for multiple CPU featuresets and then only loading the appropriate one at runtime.,Neutral

AMD,"What works in a JITted language like Java does not apply to a compiled one like C++. (In fact, the JVM support for that feature is most likely implemented in the way I described)",Neutral
AMD,try running something that uses avx512 in Intel SDE on a cpu that doesn't have avx512 and come back,Neutral
AMD,I brought up Java because of the theoretical indirection and other performance issues that could eat into the instruction reduction benefits.    JIT vs compiled is almost irrelevant because the code you write is not the code that get executed in either case.,Negative
AMD,"What? In a compiled language whatever the compiler generated is what's going to get executed on the end-user's machine. If you want that code to be able to choose between instruction sets, you have to have branches that select the correct codepath. And it's really important to have those branches at the correct granularity, because the compiler cannot really optimize across the selection boundaries.  A JIT compiler however can look at the instruction sets available on the machine it's executing on, and generate code using those, and simply jump to that code unconditionally. There are no extra indirections, no ifs/branches in the JIT case, and it can optimize the entire program with the knowledge of what instruction set(s) it's running on.  JIT vs compiled is the entire point in this case.",Neutral
AMD,You people actually think compilers can't generate branches for you. Incredible.,Negative
AMD,"Been waiting for C&C review on STX-H, mainly the memory subsystem.  Memory latency isn't all that much different to regular Strix Point.

Nvidia almost never has this problem with CUDA yet AMD consistently can't get day 1 compute API support for new hardware working.,Negative
AMD,While this is technically true it's worth noting that what ROCm supports and what ROCm claims to support are not entirely the same. I've been using ROCm on Strix Halo for months at this point and haven't had many issues with it after the first month.,Neutral
AMD,I still believe that the open source nature of ROCm is a major contributor to the delays it faces. The other is how small the software team in AMD compared to NV plus other factors.,Neutral
AMD,Remmeber when AMD asked the fans which GPU should support ROCm then was surprised the fans said all of them?,Neutral
AMD,"Apple's got a very big lead but this space is just starting to get competitive, the successor to Strix Halo is sounding really good - (supposedly) 2x - 3x the memory bandwidth and 48x RDNA 5 CU.  Of course that'll be competing against the M5 Ultra or M6 Ultra so probably still behind overall but the gap between them won't be so big.",Positive
AMD,"Not to discount your personal experience, but I don't think that any reasonable organization would ever pin their hopes on having any SKU not on the official support list working in a suitable fashion without an unknown (and potentially insurmountable) amount of issues.  Masochistic hobbyists perhaps, but not anyone looking for deliverables in a cost-effective manner when time=money.  Even considering that AMD is visibly trying to bolster their compute software stack, in its current state it's still laughable as compared to the CUDA ecosystem and this isn't going to change in the foreseeable future.",Negative
AMD,"Certainly, I agree with your first paragraph here. But ""laughable"" and ""isn't going to change in the foreseeable future"" are clearly an overdramatization. ROCm's pace of improvement has been incredibly impressive over the past ~year and change and if you haven't used it since then I'd really encourage it. It's not the same bug-addled clunky patchwork of software from two years ago - it's a strong second place to the CUDA ecosystem, and OpenAI's recent investment proves that out. In particular, TheRock has been a pretty massive step change that's expected to soon allow AMD to have day-one support for new products.",Positive

AMD,"Some misunderstanding here amongst the commenters. The RAM frequency downshift doesn't happen in Threadripper and Threadripper Pro class chips.  I'm using Threadripper 7970x with 256GB (64x4) Samsung RAM. It was rated at 4800MTs but running it at 5600MTs for almost 1.5 years now, perfectly stable. Paid nearly $1200 for the kit. I initially wanted 512GB (128x4) kit, but was costing nearly triple at the time (Feb 2024) here in India.  These workstation class CPUs have more memory controllers (per channel availability) as opposed to consumer chips. So the frequency downshift doesn't happen if you occupy all memory slots. And it certainly won't happen in Pro WX series chips (7995wx, 9995wx etc) since they have double: (8 channels in Pro 7975wx vs 4 in Threadripper 7970x vs just 2 in consumer 7950x.  I was initially very skeptical that after buying such expensive setup, if the RAM doesn't work at full speed, it would just be a lot of wasted money. So when collecting quotations from workstation builers, I put in a precondition that I'll clear the invoice only if the RAM is working at rated speeds. While one builder declined, all the others agreed to this precondition.  Hope this helps.",Neutral

AMD,"I ""hope"" for significant power consumption progress with zen 6c, 3nm io chiplet and whatever design improvement they have made.",Positive
AMD,It will probably be the biggest upgrade since OG zen but I also expect it to be the biggest price hike for the same reason.  They are going from 5/4nm to 2nm so it's two node jumps (Skipping 3nm). They are rumored to be significantly upgrading the IO die and going from 8 to 12 cores and significantly increasing frequency and IPC.   Even auxiliary downsides we have been dealing with since the original move to chiplets (Really high idle power) are rumored to be fixed.   Don't expect it to be cheap though. I wouldn't be surprised if AMD kept producing large amounts of Zen 5 just because it will be expensive and the budget segment won't want to pay for 2nm and more cores.,Positive
AMD,"I just hope more PCIe lanes, but if they keep AM5 then I guess not much hope.",Neutral
AMD,"It sounds like it will have a lot of structural changes. They are probably moving to Fanout instead of SERDES for communication and they have big changes for memory as as of now 2-DIMM motherboards are incompatible with Zen 6 if they use the old layout (mass refresh started few months ago for mini ITX and other 2 DIMM boards) from DIMM A1/B1 into A2/B2. This then can offer better latency and other benefits, especially when they are increasing core count per CCD (and the more cores the higher throughput needed to feed all cores with the workload). Zen 7 will probably transition this to AM6.",Neutral
AMD,"Should be pretty damn big and make up for Zen 5% since it's actually skipping a node straight to N2 which is significant and resulting in some crazy clock speed rumours. Then yeah CCDs are supposed to be 12 cores now, so a 50% bump, I'd love a 10 core sku, or even 8 core Ryzen 5s if the price stays reasonable.",Neutral
AMD,"I recall AMD saying something along the lines of Zen 5 introducing new CPU features and Zen 6 being more about efficiently maximising the gains from them.  However, keep in mind that in terms of revenue, consumer CPUs are merely the icing on the cake.  The money is *all* about those Epycs.  So Zen 6's ""improvements"" will focused on what makes it better as a server core - if that also makes them better as consumer cores, then so much the better.  If not... not.  They very likely will be better as consumer CPUs, though.  The Zen 5 vs Zen 5 3D difference makes it clear how much the old IMC is holding it back.",Neutral
AMD,"Zen6 is using a significantly better IO die, bridge dies, and the node is designed for *very* high clock speeds. You'll see clocks probably between 6-6.6ghz speeds. Along with 50% more cores lol.",Positive
AMD,"Well the shrink to N2 is quite significant. There're some crazy clock speed rumors I do not believe, so will not repeat, but somewhere in the mid 6GHz range would not be surprising. And some IPC gains (~10%?) on top. That plus the 1.5x core count and reworked IO die should make it quite interesting.",Neutral

AMD,"It's entirely down to whether DDR6 is ready and in the market or not. AMD has other reasons it needs to improve the IO die, reusing the IO die on Zen 5 held back the generation.

AMD's latest roadmap indicates that Zen 6 is going directly to 2nm and is expected in 2026.  > What else is happening in 2026? AMD is retiring AGESA for OpenSIL. This means that the firmware that tells the motherboard how to communicate with the CPU is being replaced right about the time a new CPU is expected to launch.  > Is it possible that the socket will not be replaced and that every motherboard in-service will require not only a new BIOS but new BIOS type in order to function?

AMD,The memory is stable. The only thing making it unstable is the garbage io die and motherboard layout.,Neutral
AMD,What's considered high speeds? I've got 5600mhz sticks. Would it be unstable if I added 2 more?,Neutral
AMD,"This is why cudimm became a thing. When you have very high clock speeds and sending the clock signal from the cpu to several memory sticks it became a problem so they moved the clock to the memory module which makes it more stable and should be able to go even faster. With 5ghz the clock goes from [0 or 1] to [1 or 0] every 0.0000000002 second (200 pico seconds). So with less distance to travel the less it can get distorted or make timing errors between sticks, the timing window is very narrow at these speeds.",Neutral
AMD,"I had to sign in to Reddit just to make this correction;    ""Many high speed ddr5 kits are still quite unstable""    This statement, or way of thinking is extremely flawed.  Intel on 12, 13, 14, or 200 series anything past 7200 on an IMC is pure lottery. 12th gen we were lucky going past 6600mhz.   And while sure before anyone says it ""But Steeze God, Xeon 6 can run 8 dimms at 8000Mhz"" Yes, but Xeon/Epyc also utilizes diffrent IO Dies with multiple Memory Controllers, usually per stick, that's not at all how client/desktop is moving.   Nova Lake, and Zen 6 are both adopting a new high speed IMC for 1 Dimm Per Channel (2 ram sticks only) Likewise, on my 9800X3D, 14900k, or 9950X3D It's easier running 2 x 48GB for 96GB than it is running 4 x 24GB on all 3 boards;   DDR5 IC's aren't unstable, it's the memory controllers, even then, not really; If 6000mhz 32GB (2 x 16GB) by AMD is validated to work, or Alderlake saying 7200mhz 32GB (2 x 16GB) it will. But when you or other guys add more dimms, or higher specs, It's not a guarantee.    Please, understand that in the technical sense, the ram is not the issue IC side, It's cpu/user error causing said instability. |  It took me 7 9800X3Ds before I found 1 that would do 6400mhz/2200FCLK, and only 1 of 6 14900k's which would do 8000Mhz stable, first hand with stability testing, I can unbiasedly say it's not the ram, but the controllers/lottery.",Negative
AMD,"For what use case do you need 4 sticks of RAM even today, let alone a future with 2x or 4x DIMM sizes which would be supported by DDR5, let alone 6.  Consumer, prosumer, enthusiast, there's support for 2x64 GB which covers basically 100% of use cases.

AMD,"The latency change ain't caused by the interconnect or packaging, it's caused by the use of lpddr with really loose timings.

We use fan out, we're for level fan out in order to connect the two dies. So you get **the lower latency**, the lower power, it's stateless.

AMD,A similar approach to how strix halo works. The rumor is they are using a fanout interconnect instead of their traditional infinity fabric interconnect. High yield talks about it in depth if you are interested in how it works https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maH6KZ0YkXU   These are rumored improvements but it is more concrete then most rumors because they already used the technology on strix halo so it's not just possible but they have already done it on another consumer product.  It already massively helped with strix halo it's unknown if they improved it even further but even if they just use the same design we have already seen it make a massive difference.   You can look up the phawx videos on strix halo to see how efficient it is below 15w (Not Idle but like an entire 40cu IGPU and 16 cores running that low of a wattage.)

I would expect the InFO interconnect to have around 3 clocks less latency than a SerDes connection, but at the clock rates involved it is still not very significant in the grand scheme.  \* a one-inch-long trace takes a small fraction of a nanosecond for electrons to traverse (less than 1/10th).

I’ve got one GPU, two NVMe SSDs, and exactly zero high bandwidth requiring peripherals. The GPU and one SSD are connected directly to the CPU. The 2nd SSD is on the chipset, but it’s not really competing with anything for bandwidth as it is. Thunderbolt is super awesome, I rely on it heavily with my work MacBook Pro… but on my PC desktop? Can’t think of what I’d use it for at all to be honest.  And again, I’m not saying my use case covers everyone. Surely some people would benefit from higher bandwidth to the chipset. The point is simply that performance improvements that come to later motherboards on the same CPU socket do not defeat the purpose of a continuous socket. Lots of people who don’t need more bandwidth to their chipset could still benefit from a new CPU generation.",Neutral

AMD,"It had the new 4 MB chip that was popular back then. 4MB started ramping in 1993 but i bought my Pentium a few years later. i proceed to eventually fill all 5 slots of it after canibalizing some ""broken"" computers for still functional parts. I think the final result was 76MB of memory in 5 slots. Surprisingly that poor mobo worked just fine with 5 different memory chips all working together. It just clamped the speed of all of them to the slowest one.",Neutral

Upgraded to the 5800X3D in 2022 and 4090 in 2023 and it’s like a whole new machine, AM4 has been a great platform.   My next upgrade will probably be a new monitor, I’ve got the 2018 AW 34” ultrawide, so only 3440x1440 120Hz IPS. I’m waiting for LG to release a 5K2K 240Hz OLED that’s either 34” or 38/39”. That might come next year.  After that I’ll be itching for a new GPU… probably get the 6090 or similar in 2027 or 2028… then I’ll be itching for a new CPU, and it’ll be time to go AM6 by then!

AMD,"Again, Zen 4 saw even greater gains with a lesser node shrink.",Negative
AMD,"The 9600XT will likely be a bottleneck for the 7800X3D in a fair amount of cases. But that is actually the *situation that you want.*  Proper attitude about bottlenecks isn't about removing them (because realistically, they can't be. At SOME point, you WILL have a bottleneck in the machine). It's about managing them. You want the bottleneck to be appropriately sized for your needs, and placed where you want it (i.e. the performance disparity between a 9060 XT 16GB and a 7800X3D on a 1080p display is reasonably small, and you want the graphics card to be the limitation when possible).  Oh and because you didn't specify, I would make sure that this is the 16GB version of the 9060 XT.",Neutral
AMD,"Its a decent combo, I think the 7800x3d is a bit overkill for the 9060xt personally, but if you are playing E-sport titles and plan on pulling 200-300 FPS it can be a good match.   Generally, I would say to go with the 9600x and a 5070/9070 that should net a better gaming experience overall.",Positive

AMD,It won't,Neutral
AMD,What Hz monitor will you be playing on and what sort of games? Mainly competitive shooters or single player AAA titles?,Neutral
AMD,It's fine for 1080p and definitely won't bottleneck. Make sure you get the RX 9060 XT 16 gb for the best performance and future compatibility.,Positive
AMD,It's fine.  Yes you will have bottlenecks as it's impossible not to.  For most gaming the rx9060xt will be the bottleneck.,Neutral

AMD,Exactly. Play the 9060xt until the wheels fall off of it. Then get a better GPU later on,Neutral
AMD,cool thanks! and yes i’m planning on getting 16GB,Positive
AMD,Youre mostly right if were talking cpu heavy games. But for more gpu demanding games the 7800x3d will probably not see much utilization.,Neutral
AMD,Not a hot take for sure,Neutral
AMD,the price jump from a 9060 to a 9070 is pretty insane for me so i might have to stick with 9060 as i am on a budget. will the 7600x work well with a 9060?,Neutral

AMD,"compatibility looks fine. You may wanna bump the PSU up in wattage if you think you'll upgrade the GPU past the 9060 XT, you could probably get a cheaper SSD with comparable specs, if you have aceess to microcenter you should look at their bundles.  those are all nitpicks though. if you ordered it rn it'd be fine",Positive
AMD,How much is that total and where are you located?,Neutral
AMD,Ok thank you!,Positive
AMD,This costs around $1350 and I am located in Eastern Europe,Neutral
AMD,"Alright.  Overall it looks good. If you can save a little by going with another RX 9060 XT 16 GB then do that. Also consider spending a little more on maybe an 750 or 850W Gold rated PSU, that leaves more room for potential upgrades.  Might also be able to save a little on another SSD like WD SN7100, those Samsung PRO SSDs tend to be a little on the expensive side with no real benefit.",Positive
AMD,Noted.   Bumped the PSU to 750W (Corsair CX750).  The only available WD SN7100 is 4TB at the moment so alternatively there is a Kingston KC3000 that would save me around $35 over the Samsung,Neutral

AMD,"If all you do is game, you choose the cpu that's better value for gaming, lol. Which is the 9800x3d, what are you confused about",Neutral
AMD,"I went through this same dilemma. If you are going to do any video, photo editing and such then go with 9950X3D, but if you are only gaming go with 9800X3D. I went with the 980p and am really happy.",Positive
AMD,"Can we ban this question, it’s asked every single day",Negative
AMD,If its primarily for gaming go with the 9800x3d. You dont gain anything gaming wise from the 9950x3d and it costs significantly more so you would be paying for pretty much nothing.,Negative
AMD,Would the 9950 work better if you have an ultra wide up with a game in the middle and chrome windows open on both sides of the game window? Wondering if the extra cores would take on that load.,Neutral
AMD,"I started streaming with a 3800x cpu. 8c/16t. Discord open, OBS cpu encoding, chrome open, gaming and all that. Background tasks take up less than 1 thread.   I had a 7950x3d and went up to a 9800x3d. Still an amazing streaming and gaming setup.   The 9950x3d boosts like 200mhz higher than the 9800x3d but it can be complicated with so many cores and some apps and games not choosing the right ones. I had the threat scheduling program I cant think of the name, but the 9800x3d has none of those issues and is much cheaper and basically the same performance.   So theres no real worry you'll run out of threads on it especially when you take streaming out of it.",Positive
AMD,"If price isn't a factor then The question is can you use those extra eight cores, if you can't then might as well save some money if you can then get the 9950 X3D as it will perform about the same in gaming plus or minus a few percent as it is the same architecture.",Neutral
AMD,Go for 9950x3d so you can stream at the same time.,Neutral

AMD,"You have solids parts, idk why you need an upgrade.   Is it the prebuilt PC’s AIO fault? Is the Thermal paste dry & turned into, not paste?   Prebuilt’s tend to be built like shit, so maybe check the parts in your case. Fan & coolers alike.",Negative
AMD,"They are exactly the same for gaming, so 9800X3D is the answer. The 9950X3D makes sense if you do other things than gaming that actually benefit from such a powerful 16 core CPU. For gaming it would be a waste of money.",Neutral
AMD,"9800x3d: less heat, easier to cool.   9950x3d: the feel of having the best cpu for am5 (until the next am5 cpu comes along)  Most games do not load my 9950x3d for more than 10-20%. But there are exceptions. You will see the benefit of 9950x3d only in some games. The rational choice would be to get 9800x3d or some other x3d for cheaper now and then switch it to the next gen am5 cpu later.",Positive

AMD,"If money is not problem, what about some time?  Wait for January and get the 9850X3D - 400mhz more plus likely another 200 OC.  They are effectively the golden silicon samples of the 9800X3D that can clock higher",Neutral
AMD,"As others have said, 9800X3D is for gaming and will perform on par with the 9950X3D with a less substantial price value. However, if you want to do other things other than gaming, such as video editing or heavy workload tasks, then get the 9950X3D. Either way, you won't have an edge on either processor in terms of gaming in whichever you choose.",Neutral

AMD,"Unlikely to make any difference, apart from maybe a few % so not worth it.",Negative
AMD,"not at all.   9950X3D is a 16 core CPU.   Most games use only 4-6 cores. Very few use 8 cores, and only a literal handful could even manage to use more than that - if that was the case, then you'd already know if you needed a 9950.   Running 2 browser instances doesnt even register as a blip for even 1 core to be fully utilized.   Running an ultrawide display, is more about GPU capabilities than CPU. And with the way you're saying you want to use it as.... its never going to matter.",Negative
AMD,Should really make no meaningful difference since you'll almost certainly use the GPU (eg. NVENC) for encoding so the CPU barely has to do anything in relation to streaming.,Neutral
AMD,"You shouldnt be using the CPU to render/encode your streams - is slow an inefficient.   GPUs have their own dedicated encoder that takes frames from the frame buffer that have already been rendered.   Most streamers, the ones that are actually gaming... are still streaming and gaming from their 1 PC and it does it very well with using the GPU to do the work.   Its fast, highly efficient, and unless the streaming platform you're streaming on even allows you to have a bitrate thats in the 10,000-12,000+ to run higher resolutions where the bitrate would actually matter.... CPU rendering is useless. The only streamers that even have such bitrates available to stream at, at the ones who are pulling in tens thousands of viewers each stream, whom are on a consistent schedule that justifies the platform in unlocking that ability. And even most of those aren't game streamers, they're talking heads with a mostly static image coming from their $800+ DSLR face cam.   The average streamer, even if you run a podcast that has 1-5k viewers every stream... are usually locked to 6000 and below. I think on Twitch you're limited to a bitrate of 3500 and only until you meet certain thresholds will they even allow you to hit 6000.    The only time anyone should be using their CPU to encode for streaming, is when you're running a dual-PC streaming setup so that 1 PC runs the stream, alerts, overlays and transitions, recording and transcoding - so that the gaming PC's resources are not taking away from the performance of the gaming PC. And even then in a dual-PC setup - its just better to be letting the GPU on the Stream PC to be doing all that work.",Neutral
AMD,"Hmmm, let's  think.  The Ultra 9 is on a platform that has no future, it's ""dead"", there is no opportunity to drop in the next gen Intel cpu.  The Ultra trails both your current cpu in many games and it trails many of the AMD cpu's.   The Ultra is obliterated by the AMD x3d chips.    The one advantage the Ultra has is in productivity apps.  The 9950x3d goes toe to toe with the Ultra 9 in productivity apps:  a little faster in some, a little slower in others.  The Ultra cannot compare with the 9950x3d in gaming.  The vcache side of 9950x3d is actually a 9800x3d. The 9950x3d also obliterates the Ultra in gaming, because, well it is a 9800x3d when gaming.  Both the 9950x3d and the 9800x3d are on the AM5 platform.  AMD will run its next generation of cpu's, Zen6, on the AM5 platform.  Reliable sources report that Zen7 will also be AM5.  If you go with a chip setting on the AM5 platform (e.g. 9950x3d), you have the opportunity to simply drop in a Zen6 then a Zen7 cpu and have a modern and relevant machine for another 5+ years.  Intel only dreams of this!  The price delta between the 9950x3d and the 9800x3d is about $200.  If you have any doubts, get the 9950x3d.   Better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.    I was considering a 9800x3d vs a 9950x3d, I went with the 9950x3d.   Precisely because I want to know I have the flexibility to do more than game.  From a price to performance ratio for gaming, the 9800x3d is the winner.  If spending an extra $200 for the best, the fastest consumer cpu on the market , is woth the peace of mind?  No brainer,  go with the 9950x3d!",Negative
AMD,"If you want a cpu for 99% gaming, then get the best cpu for gaming which would be the 9800x3d. I was in the same boat as you last year when I switched to AMD. I was always an Intel person.

AMD,Ultra 9 is slower than the i9-13900KF in gaming.,Negative
AMD,"Nope. I've always been Intel, but I'm switching over to AMD when I get my next paycheck.",Neutral
AMD,"There is nothing in your use case that would make the Ultra 9 a better choice than the 9800x3d. Same for the 9950x3d, the 9800x3d is the clear best choice and the second best choice would 7800x3d",Neutral
AMD,Its a dead socket.   So no upgrade path when Intel releases their next-gen CPU and Socket. You'd be forced to also replace the motherboard if you go with Intel. At least you can keep the same RAM sticks.,Negative

AMD,"Do these things in the background include multiple overlays for IRacing, music, and other software for numerous peripherals like pedals, wheelsbases etc?",Neutral
AMD,"I'd keep fiddling with it over getting a new CPU unless you really don't care about the money.   If you're going to switch to an 8-core CPU anyway, why not try dropping your 13900 to 8 P-cores, no hyper threading, and a bit of an undervolt. Your cooler is also relevant here but I'm assuming you have something decent?  I made the same changes to my 13700 and a client's 14900 and it's much better now.",Neutral
AMD,"Sounds like your CPU may have been degraded enough if you're having issues with it. 13 and 14th gen CPUs have 2 different issues - 1 is Intel letting motherboard manufacturers pump so much voltage to the CPU to run higher clockspeeds that they degrade really fast. So there were many BIOS updates to correct it, and also add the ""Enforce Intel Limits"" option to actually keep these CPUs operating how they were actually designed. The other problem was manufacturing defect - something about corrosion within the die so you'd have a permanently gimped CPU that no amount of undervolting and capping clockspeeds would ever help.   Might be time to RMA the CPU and get a fresh one from Intel - if yours is still within the warranty period. I would try this option first before trying to replace the entire platform. A brand new fresh CPU for free.... or spending $600-700 for a 9800X3D?  Like any corporation, they'll want to try to deny your claim, but if you pushback they're likely to replace that CPU.",Negative
AMD,"With the 4090 and some background apps, the 9950x3d might actually be worth the money if you don't care about the increased cost.     I hear you might need to manually assign the 3d cores to games though for maximum efficiency though, and I don't think it'll be any better in a meaningful way outside of not overdoing the load on your CPU with background using up assets",Neutral
AMD,"Used to run the same, except a 14900k, plagued with issues and had 2 degraded CPU's replaced with warranty in the span of 7 months, until I had enough and switched to an AMD R9 9950X, smooth sailing since.  Fuck Intel, CPU crashed mid windows update, corrupted everything",Neutral
AMD,"Nope, it's roughly the same performance as the 9800x3d in games. The main issue is that the 9950x3d is way more expensive so there's no point spending that much money for bonus productivity that will not be used.",Negative
AMD,"No.   They perform identical in games.   If you're just using your PC primarily for gaming, there is absolutely no reason why you'd need a 16-core/32-thread CPU that doesnt game any better than the 8-core/16-thread 9800X3D.   There's also a nearly $200 price difference between them.   9800X3D retails for $459.   9950X3D retails for $649.    Again, just for gaming.... you really want to spend almost $200 more for a CPU that performs the exact same?  That extra $200 could get you into a whole new tier of GPU. It can mean the difference between a 5070Ti and a 5080. Or a 5070 and 5070Ti.",Neutral

AMD,"Thats great, but have you checked the core parking in several games?",Positive
AMD,"I am really thankful that you want to help me out, But i luckily got it working in the end,  Reinstalling windows was a routine in my 2 months of trouble shooting,  I lived inside bios,  Ripped out components, Replaced all cables, keyboard , mouse, and monitor   Windows 24h2 and 25h2 with and without updates, Stock windows and custom debloated versions,  Tried every single driver from motherboard,  windows, and directly from the manufacturers,  Every single hack, tweak, and fixes found on YouTube, forums, and reddit,  In the end, it was a combination of faults in the bios, Windows being windows, 2 drivers that secretly wouldn't install, and the software AMD itself that's only  fixed by registry settings,  And after all that, it's sometimes still buggy only to be fixed by a pc restart  Luckily,the last one won't happen very often ...so far",Positive
AMD,"The driver works to tell the OS to park the cores unless they're actually needed.  You can easily see this behavior using either task manager or AMD Ryzen Master if you have a second monitor to display it on your while gaming.  The OS will unpark them and allow other processes to use them if they need it, but it tries to keep them idle if possible.",Neutral
AMD,"It’s an 8 core CPU. The 13900 is 8 Performance cores + 16 efficiency cores. It has 32 threads vs the 16 threads on the 9800x3d  Sure the 9800x3d will get a fps boost from the 3d cache when gaming but outside of gaming the 13900k is faster per core and overall. Just look at single threaded and multi threaded core each r23 tests that put the cpus to the test. For multi threaded the 13900k scores in the 38,000 range and 9800x3d scores around 23,000    For single core it’s 2100 for the 9800x3d and 2300 for the 13900k  So technically the 13900k is a faster more capable chip due to having more cores and a good single threaded performance. The only place the 9800x3d will be an improved is in gaming fps thanks to the 3d cache. This is fine if all you do is game and want higher FPS but beyond that, it’s a slower chip in every other way than the 13900k.  The 9950x3d is faster than the 13900k in every way, not just gaming FPS. I’d go that route if it’s in your budget (and I did from a 13900k).

AMD,"""some background apps"" amount to very little justification for having a 16core cpu. I think people overestimate what ""multitasking"" really means and think that you can only run a handful of apps before needing a CPU upgrade. RAM matters more to multi-tasking than CPU cores do - unless you actually use your PC to earn a living with - in which case, in a professional setting - yes, the 9950X3D is the BARE MINIMUM you'll want to use.   As a PC used 99% for gaming? No.   I have a 9800X3D and use my PC almost exclusively for gaming - occasionally i'll render or re-encode a video or two but im not running a game at the same time - I like being able to utilize my GPU at full-tilt of around 150fps when I'm re-encoding an 80GB 4K movie down to 10GB so I can watch some movies while I travel. I run multiple browser tabs, discord, a torrent client and sometimes Jellyfin.  The only other stuff running in the background is the typical list of windows processes that everyone has running.   Discord and my browser are chillin on my 2nd monitor and they're basically idle while Im gaming on BF6 or playing Expedition 33. Maybe I have a podcast playing... but that doesnt even fully utilize 1 core.   Unless OP is running a VM or two and/or is actually multi-tasking by letting a video or blender rendering, or some CFD program... a 9950X3D is not going to benefit him at all.  OP's use-case is similar to mine. PC mostly used for gaming with only a handful of typical programs running in conjunction with the primary focus being on a game.  The adage of ""unused RAM is wasted RAM"" would fit perfectly if you swapped ""RAM"" with ""cores"". Unused cores is wasted cores. If OP is only going to be using no more than 6-8 cores... the extra 8 cores are just going to be sitting idle barely registering as a blip.   Its also nearly $200 more expensive.",Neutral
AMD,I'm waiting for 9600x3d,Neutral
AMD,"I am not sure about that. It may cost close to $1000 and it probably only benefit very selected games that needs more compute than 8 cores can offer. In addition, there will still be a lot of context switching costs between the 2 CCDs.  That being said, I found myself to be a potential beneficiary of Ryzen 9 because I like keeping multiple low demand gacha games idling in the background (so I do not need to keep relaunching them). Although these games are both low demand and idling, they typically still fully occupy at least 1 cpu core",Neutral
AMD,"-update Bios and chipset drivers  -windows power settings - balanced   -Update gamebar and make sure it recognizes your game when you launch   To verify, You can pull up resource monitor, then go to gamebar settings and select “recognize this as a game” then when you close and relaunch the program the cpu tab will show half the cores parked.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm well aware of that, but OP stated they will use it 99% for gaming so they should really pick a CPU that does best what they do 99% of the time. That's why I would consider the 9800X3D to be an upgrade. If they did 50/50 gaming and productivity you could definitely argue differently.  I do gaming and quite a bit of other stuff that can benefit from a lot of cores so I would personally get the 9950X3D if I were to upgrade now.",Positive
AMD,"Well the 13900 is a very hot chip so unless you have a 360mm AIO, you're going to have issues running it at full capacity. That's why limiting the cores helps. It's reducing the heat generation so the chip doesn't throttle.  Regardless, if you just feel like replacing the CPU, board, and ram is easier, no worries!",Neutral
AMD,"I suppose fair enough, but the 4090 is full on top tier GPU of its generation and if anything will ever bottleneck a 3d chip at max settings, its one if the two most likely    Also seems like it'll fetch a better resale value if they ever want to upgrade in the far future since it'll be able to handle rendering, and easier to hold if they want to maintain top tier performance keeping it far into the future. $200 is also ram miney right now",Positive
AMD,Read my post closer.,Neutral
AMD,"Thanks for trying to help,  But like I said before  I already fixed the problem,  It was difficult to find even for people that knows what they are doing,  If it was this easy, it would not have taken me 2 months to fix,  I don't mean to disrespect or be mean to you, But I am just trying to tell people how much problems can come from the dual ccd Cpu's   I don't want people to need to become full on TI certified just to fix the stupid issues that's not even the fault of the customers  Just to play games.",Negative
AMD,At anything less than 53 cores I crash to bios in the middle of a game. Anything more and it runs but not for long.,Neutral
AMD,"Meaningless because 9800X3D edges out the 9950X3D by slim margins, they typically trade blows even if the 9950 has a slightly higher clock speed on the cache CCD.   Typically good performing CPUs always hold their value much better: Look at the used prices of 5700X3D & 5800X3D - they're hitting over $300 and brand new stock that still exists is spiking due to high demand and no more production.   Its kind of a moot point when you're looking at it from a purely financial incentive.",Neutral
AMD,I guess I replied to the wrong person,Negative
AMD,For sure I feel you. I didn’t see that you had fixed it. This CPU should come with a guide or something so no one misses one of these important steps. I was surprised I had to seek the information out through other sources,Negative
AMD,"Sorry, 53 cores?  Regardless, it sounds more like you have a bad part rather than a situation where you need an upgrade.  If you have your bios up to date and set to Intel default limits, you can set P-cores to 8, E-cores to 0, and disable hyper-threading.  If your PC is still shutting off or crashing, it could be the cooler, the CPU (Intel 13th/14th gen failures, or even the SSD (because it's crashing to bios).

AMD,"The 13th and 14th of intel CPUs are known to have some issues, just update your bios and you'll be fine.",Neutral
AMD,"From what i understand the 9800x3d wins by having less latency between cores, hence why it performs better with a lower clock. Most games also don't utilize more than 8 cores, so the 9950x3d also doesn't typically have a way to take a lead and ever so slightly underperforms as the rest of them don't get usage in game even if you make sure all 3d are utilized    The difference is also small, though, and if you ever want to upgrade you'll have a wider market to sell too as a gamer won't think twice about a 9950x3d over a 9800x3d, and animators/researchers would also probably be happy with a older model.     I'm not going fo say I didn't have doubts or I think i know better than you, but why worry about an extra $200 with a GPU that you couldn't catch for less than 1.5k if it let's you handle everything the more competitive model can, then heavier more professional loads today with potential to help later if theres ever a bottleneck?",Neutral
AMD,"Its all good mate,  I totally agree with you, Its so retarded that you have to happen to know   That you need to use Xbox game mode, gamebar and  NOT change the power scheme off balanced at minimum,  At maximum you need to Update and Change multiple settings in bios,  Install the processors Gpu driver and also before the chipset driver as otherwise it will secretly not install 2 drivers without telling you,  And become a bug fixer when at somepoint the  gamebar will screw up by directly change registry settings or build a Bat file ...  And thats not even all the things I could list,  Its completely bonkers",Negative
AMD,"Because why should OP spend $200 more money for a CPU that will go under utilized, when the 9800X3D will suit his use case? Especially when he said 99% of the time the pc will be used for gaming...  You're going into this under the impression that PC hardware is somehow an investment... like a car, its a depreciating asset. It MIGHT hold more value, for a bit longer. But nobody buys hardware thinking how much money they are going to get back when they sell the hardware later. Or.... in the chance that MAYBE OP's use-case might change... which it would just be easier to upgrade to the latest and greatest at whatever time in the future that he needs something that suits his needs better.   Like I said elsewhere, that $200 can be spent elsewhere thats more meaningful... like going with a higher tier GPU, or more storage space. Or not spending it at all.",Neutral
AMD,"Most reputable sites will have compatibility filters for your chosen CPU.  Same with coolers. You just have to decide air vs liquid AIO. After six years with an AIO, I've made the switch back to a decent air cooler.  Sorry I can't help you with your question regarding RAM. I bought a new rig two months ago, but didn't notice any insane RAM prices.",Neutral

AMD,"The only part I can help with is the RAM price question. I bought a 2x64 AM5 kit ten days ago at NewEgg, and it's gone up by $80 US since. I'd get whatever the Ram is going to be, even if you need to wait on the rest.",Neutral
AMD,Yes! As long as it’s in good condition a 6700xt under 200 bucks is a good buy. I recently upgraded from a 6700xt but it was incredible. I ran it with a 240hz oled 1440p monitor and it never gave me issues. Definitely worth it.,Positive
AMD,xfx one is better imo should be same price or less,Positive
AMD,Sounds like a fair price.,Neutral
AMD,"Back then it was a solid 1440p card capable of handling 2160p. Now, in the fucking era of UE5, 6700 XT is more like a 1080p card, but with the help of upscaling and frame generation, you are still able to play a lot of 2160p titles close to 60 fps, although I don't recommend this card for such high resolution. Anyway, it is still decent for the budget.",Neutral
AMD,"For that price definitely! I got the PowerColor Hellhound RX 6700 XT just last week used for €180. And I'm very happy with. Currently playing Expedition 33 at 1440p, having such a blast. Definitely recommend both the gpu and the game :)",Positive
AMD,"The 6700XT is definitely a solid GPU ! Among a few others. I recently did an AM5 build. Slapped the Trusty MSI Radeon Mech In to see what gives.

AMD,6700 xt mech oc here.  Runs 1440 great,Positive
AMD,I have a 6700 XT and a 6800 that I'm trying to sell I didn't know that their value was still that decent.,Neutral
AMD,To be fair it was either really old games or low framerate to say it was incredible at 1440P. Only upgraded from my 6700XT but IMO it's very much a 1080P spec card these days. If you're playing pretty old games I guess you can get on frames at 1440P. solid 2080p card though.,Positive

AMD,PSU cables are correct as the PSU I purchased made it pretty idiot proof (everything was labeled). Completely clean Windows 11 install with some stuff brought over using an external drive. I am indeed getting advertised speeds on my RAM as I made sure to enable EXPO. RAM is spaced out as it should be to ensure proper operation.

AMD,"So, I have a different take as someone who uses these Ryzen 9s for work and gaming. The 7900x is a really nice CPU that will more than handle any game and offer a smoother experience for multitasking than its lower core count versions. Now if u just want to game with chrome and discord opened and want to save some money then a 7600x/9600x is a good idea.   But if u plan to have multiple apps opened like chrome discord, OBS or other streaming recording softwares and many more then I do think a 7900x or the newer 9900x is a good idea again as it will offer a smoother and better overall experience to a ryzen 7 or 5.  As for RAM u will want 6000mts as most AM5 CPUs dont run past that by default amd require some manual tuning in bios. AM5 CPUs also like low latency or low CL ratings so CL 30 is ussually a good place to be. Just as an added note 2 kits of RAM on at CL30-40-40-96 and another at CL36-36-36-96 are the same there is no real benefit between these 2 kits as they have the same overall latency. If u can I would look for a kit like this 6000mts CL30-36-36-76",Positive

AMD,"i would strongly advise agaisnt the 5070. the 9070 is a much better choice. the 12gb alone make the 5070 a bad pick for games to come.  things to consider: 9070 can be heavily tuned because biomods are now possible and some modells have the same cooler as the 9070xt.   9070xt you can do some undervolting, but daily stable gains usually are rather small. so do not overlook the 9070 in your calculations (even though personally i think 9070xt is goat...)  also, i would suggest to look at the games you actually want to play if you make your decission. the 50 games average graph might not tell you what you need to know.  i would also suggest to consider that the nvidia cards are MUCH faster in games with older rt-implementations made by nvidia (though rdna4 has closed the gap by a lot).  in newer titles, especially in ue5 titles with (hw)lumen, the relative performance is much better for the rdna4 cards then the 50 games average would indicate.   excample: both in borderlands4 and outer worlds 2, the 9070xt on pair with the 5080. (bl4 does not have hardware rt, but tow2 does)  finally, amds driver software is much better then nvidias and amd had much less driver issues during the last years and made higher performance gains with newer drivers.  and of course: if you need the card to do productivity work, all that is irrelevant because then your only real option is nvidia.  finally:   for the 5070ti, 9070xt and biosmodded 9070, you would want a 850W psu.   cpu: agreed, that cpu upgrade is absolutely worth it. its only a few % of the total system price anyhow and the cpu is much faster in games. especially ue5 has become quite a cpu killer and loves 3dx.",Positive

AMD,"Looks like a solid build. If you really got the 9700X for that little it's a no-brainer. For the regular price of the 9700X I would have looked at a tray version of the 7800X3D.  > Is the PSU enough for the build (9070XT more specifically), or would a 750W PSU be OK ?  For the build the 750W unit is more than enough. However it is worth noting that the price gap between 750W and 850W units is exceptionally small at the moment and it may be wise to just get the similarly priced 850W unit for more optionality if you choose to upgrade in the future.  > Is the B850 mobo really needed?

AMD,"**Answers:**  **What do you think of the build? Is it solid or has it flaws?**   The CPU + GPU combo is rock solid. I’ve got the same setup and haven’t had a single issue running new titles on ultra settings. My 1080p monitor is the only bottleneck now 😅  **Is the PSU enough for the build (9070XT more specifically), or would a 750W PSU be OK?**   750W should technically be enough, check the GPU vendor specifications just to be safe.  **Is the B850 mobo really needed? Or is a B650 (E?) enough? I see contradictory information on that.**   I’m using the MSI B650 Plus and it works perfectly fine. Unless you need advanced PCIe 5.0 support or beefier VRMs for heavy overclocking, B650(E) should be enough.  **For the 9070XT, I mostly see Sapphire and XFX at lower prices. Are these reliable brands? Or should I prefer Gigabyte or ASRock, for example?**   I went with Sapphire—great cooling and no issues so far. If you're not into overclocking, Sapphire or XFX are solid picks. For more aggressive tuning, you might want to compare thermals and VRMs across brands.  **Do I need to buy thermal paste separately?**   I didn’t. My cooler came with pre-applied paste, and I run my CPU at 105W mode. If you’re planning to push beyond that, investing in a good thermal paste could help.  **Do I need a GPU bracket/support/holder?**   Yes—definitely recommended. The 9070XT is a heavy card, and a bracket helps prevent long-term sag or stress on the PCIe slot.  **Do I need anything else that won’t be provided with any of the components yet?**   If you’ve got a modular PSU, make sure you have all the necessary power cables. Also double-check for case screws, standoffs, and Wi-Fi antennas (if your mobo supports it).",Positive

AMD,"Thank you very much!  I was initially going for the 9600X, but seeing the price of the 9700X getting lower and lower, I just thought the extra € was worth it. It reached that price on Aliexpress (tray version) in SEP with the promo codes + shipping from a European warehouse.  Indeed, 750w and 850w PSUs seem very close in price. But I'll keep an eye on the 750w promos, in case I could save a few bucks there and invest them somewhere else in the build.  Just checked the price of B650E mobos and it seems like the price difference with the B850 is decreasing quite a bit. Looking at the prices, it seems the B850 would def be a good deal.

Insanely expensive for very small uplifts compared to the base version. Games rarely profit from more than 8 cores which is why 1CCD with X3D is enough. You basically pay to avoid potential scheduling issues that were a thing in the past. Seems rather useless.  As for the rumored 8C/16T, as in 9850X3D or whatever you want to call it, it just seems weird. Like why would this exist? It would only compete again zen6. What would be the point of this thing. All you are doing is massively skewing the expectation for the eventual next gen while already being market leader and performance king. The entire SKU makes no sense.   The only reality where this part makes sense if they expect Intels upcoming gen in early 2026 to beat the 9800X3D of its throne (which seems highly unlikely at this point but maybe they know more than we do).

AMD,"Since many people don't seem to open the link to read the article, here's some more information:  >A companion model, the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, is expected to follow a similar design with eight cores, 96 MB of L3 cache, and a boost up to 5.6 GHz, with a 120 W power envelope. The 9850X3D appears to be a refined, higher-clocked (+400 MHz) alternative to existing 8-core Ryzen 7 9800X3D models, offering improved single-thread performance that is highly valued by gamers, while maintaining a relatively modest TDP.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm not surprised they may be doing this.  I know people have been ASKING about it.  Still, I'm not sure who it is FOR.  Gamers, not really.  Maybe there are some workloads that will benefit, as 3DVC is a thing on some Epycs.  For consumers, I don't think there are really any workloads that will benefit.  So maybe this will be an Epyc part, or close to it.",Neutral
AMD,Desde hace 10 años tengo un i7 5775c y hasta la fecha sigue dando buen rendimiento y desempeño con GPU actuales y francamente NO sabía porque (¿?) pero hace unos meses supe que era porque tiene una ENORME cache L4 de 128 Mb y hasta la fecha no me hace cuello de botella a mi RX 9060 XT 16 GB en resolución de 1080p hacia arriba en juegos actuales del 2025 por eso creo que la elección de AMD de ampliar su cache de 96 Mb a 192 Mb fue muy acertada.,Neutral
AMD,"The reason there was no dual-X3D Zen 4 or Zen 3 is that the L3 cache only works because its latency is very low and adding inter-CCD latency, as well as coherency traffic, to that actually harmed things more than it helped them.  *Possibly* AMD has seen people buying 9950X3Ds for purely gaming rigs, where it is usually less powerful than a much cheaper 9800X3D. The 9950X3D is (of course) a far more profitable CPU, and AMD has likely figured that actual performance doesn't mean as much as perception does.",Negative
AMD,Meanwhile we got Intel pulling literal shit out the toilet  Intel core ultra max duo 7,Negative
AMD,"With this, both CCDs would have the extra L3 cache, so parking games on either CCD should perform basically the same.",Neutral

AMD,Most halo products are unnecessary for the majority of consumers. Remember when people used to pay more than $1000 for Intel Extreme Edition CPUs? They were an awful value.,Negative
AMD,"There's still some benefit.  Inter-CCD latency is still far better than DRAM.  Sure, there's a penalty, but there's a penalty on literally any dual CCD CPU.  Yet Epycs perform well and sell.  The reason they claimed they could not do this is cost.  Which, makes sense.  I see this being a $1000 CPU.  Still, not sure who it is FOR.",Positive
AMD,">*Possibly* AMD has seen people buying 9950X3Ds for purely gaming rigs, where it is usually less powerful than a much cheaper 9800X3D.  FYI: This is just wrong. The difference is typically minimal/nothing, but the 9950X3D is almost always \*more\* powerful than the 9800X3D. Worth the extra money for gaming? Absolutely not.

Well...  Not really much more to say, is there?",Negative
AMD,I don't even know what is what anymore.   Maybe this is exactly what they want. Maybe they have such an overabundance of Zen 2 and 3 supply that they don't know what to do with them. Maybe this is their way to get rid of all that without them coming off as outdated.   It's purposefully confusing and misleading.   I don't like it.,Negative
AMD,"AMD is a bunch of clowns, they just changed the stupid names to RYZEN AI, etc.  They're ridiculous.   They need to get rid of the amateurs who make these changes every 6 months, it's not possible.",Negative

AMD,both would be a novelty on the desktop,Neutral
AMD,"While different naming schemes can be hard to make quick evaluations and ads an extra step, all it means is consumers should be educated on the basics and not be afraid to pull up a chart of the performance metrics that matter most to them, benchmarks, battery, etc. They should already be evaluating the totality of a notebook so looking at real-world testing and scores in relevant things they want to have the laptop or mini or desktop etc do is valid regardless.   It's hard for consumers to navigate, but the change in numbering scheme is enough for consumers to be aware its meant as a low power option.",Neutral
AMD,this is largely driven by OEMs who want the cheapest chips while it not being obvious that it's previous generation silicon,Neutral
AMD,"When intel did that 8 years ago, everyone cursed them - included me.",Negative
AMD,shameless shit from AMD,Negative
AMD,"Eh, I would say this new system is less confusing than the old naming scheme. 0x0 is Zen 2 1xx is Zen 3 2xx is Zen 4 3xx is Zen 5  First digit is gen, next two bigger number = better.  A bit simple, but not bad.  If they keep this system up (using 4xx for Zen 6 and 5xx for Zen 7) then I think most people will be fine with this scheme.  The problem is that there is no trust that AMD will continue this naming scheme, especially since their actual customers for these chips (the large laptop OEMs) seem to want confusing naming on stuff.",Neutral
AMD,"Honestly it works.   Im fairly tech savy (look im in a tech subreddit) but i couldnt, if my life depended on it, give you advice on amd laptop cpu skews.    And i think thats entirely their goal.",Negative
AMD,"AMD is making money hand over fist right now, so clearly they’re doing something right. You not liking a rebrand doesn’t mean anything.",Neutral
AMD,"Ah, you are missing something really important here - what the actual customers want.  The customer for laptop chips is not the end consumer like you or I, but large laptop OEMs .  And those companies want regular rebadged names for the cheaper older chips, as they believe newer names equals more sales.  Hard to blame AMD for making their direct customers happy.    Note how for stuff that has more direct consumer sales like desktop chips they don't do the rebadge game (granted the desktop chips do have some questionable naming decisions, but the same chips keep the same name), likewise for the professional stuff.",Neutral
AMD,"That would be the Ryzen Ai 9 395, which yes, has a  iGPU that is pretty close to a mobile RTX 4070.",Neutral
AMD,> it's previous generation silicon  Some of it is way worse than even that. There are _Zen 2_ chips implicated here. That is some shamelessly re-badged garbage on AMD's part. These chips are barely even new enough to run Windows 11.,Negative
AMD,I just send them toward Lunar Lake.,Neutral
AMD,"I didn't say that I don't like rebranding, I said that it's crap to do a rebrand every 6 months, everyone gets confused, it's not clear. However, I like AMD but they are very bad at it.

AMD,That's buck!,Neutral
AMD,"CPUs that didn't make it as 7900X3D (one die with 3D V-Cache) or 7600X3D. The 7500X3D should have the same amount of cores with 3D V-Cache as the first two named CPUs, but with lower clock speed.  Also cheaper CPUs might favor certain markets where electronics are very high taxed and import costs. Countries like Brazil and Argentina in South America pay a lot for their PC parts compared to their average income.",Neutral
AMD,"AMD isn't making these. They get their chips from TSMC. Every so often they have chips that don't pass quality control - a defective core or graphics die, etc.  They save those and when they have enough, they launch them as a lower-tier product. They don't have a lot of them, that's why they're only released in limited numbers - Microcenter only, etc.",Negative
AMD,9500x3d would be pretty neat,Positive
AMD,"Likely 7600x3Ds that couldn't make the cut   The difference between Zen 4 & zen 5 is negligible anyway, in performance and efficiency (If you match the power limits)",Negative
AMD,They tend to dump the last usable x3D dies late as x500x3D.  I think they release them last cause they don't have a lot of them and they don't really fit in the performance numbering scheme well.,Negative
AMD,"Probably not a lot of ""failed"" Zen5 chips yet. They're accumulating stock for this before they launch ""failed"" SKUs so they'd have at least some stock and not just selling one at a time.",Neutral
AMD,>CPUs that didn't make it as 7900X3D  That would mean 2 CCDs and one disabled?,Neutral
AMD,"Since we're only now getting 7500x3Ds, wee probably won't see those for 2 years.",Neutral

AMD,Possible.,Neutral
AMD,"Isn't zen 5 on the desktop ridiculously memory bottlenecked, especially on (albeit rare) avx-512 workloads? I guess the server parts benefit a lot from having quad-channel memory.",Neutral
AMD,You see it on the desktop space.   The zen 5 'x' CPUs gota 65W power limit. So they looked super efficient compared to zen 4 'x' CPUs   But when you gave zen 4 the same power limits (Or just used the non-x) it's almost as efficient,Positive

AMD,Why would u buy that instead of a 5080 and save a few bucks? I guess for gamers + ai-ers,Neutral
AMD,32GB is the most it can have. The use of GDDR6 prevents them from using more.,Neutral
AMD,"They already sold cards like the W7900 48GB, that one's just a lot more expensive and released at a time when AMD and ML was less viable than it is now.",Negative
AMD,"For it's intended use case it makes sense. People buying these are most likely to get 2. Mostly so you can have a nice and cozy 64GB VRAM setup for the price and power draw of a single 5090. Well, 2x 32GB it's not exactly 64GB but in some applications of AI it can be.  Weird thing is that these cards are already out, I have seen some available with next day delivery.",Positive
AMD,"This is a good thing. Exhausting heat out of the case vs into it. You can stack many of these, this way.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah no that’s standard for server cards.   In server rooms, server stations are organized into rows where the pathways between them are either hot paths or cold paths.   Cold air is vented in through the cold paths. Hot hair must be exhausted into the hot paths; not in the cold paths and especially not within the cases themselves. Hot air is vented out of the hot paths and either to the outside or an air-recycling HVAC.",Neutral

AMD,What are you talking about? This is a workstation card and there's no 9800.,Negative
AMD,Don't your XTX has 30% more memory bandwidth its money down the drain if you ask me,Negative
AMD,"It’s for neither, it’s aimed towards productivity. Good for running local AI models in data centers.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah, and Arc Raiders. They dont charge you that much for complaints",Neutral
AMD,"Idk what you are getting downvote, but the answer is probably. ~~There is no video out, it's more of a GPGPU.~~~  ~~Maybe you could if they support virtual display like for VDI~~  Edit : I didn't noticed the DP on the thumbnail! So yeah, it should work.",Neutral
AMD,You use a GPU for playing video games? What a weird thing to do.    I'm pretty sure everyone uses them for compute.,Negative
AMD,"It's not that it uses GDDR6. It's the 256 bit bus.  Although if there are 8GB GDDR6 chips, they could in theory use them for 64GB VRAM",Neutral
AMD,32+32 = not 64?,Neutral
AMD,"They're also nice for workstations. This card dumps the vast majority of its heat out of the case itself, and does some work as an exhaust fan in general. Add to that the spacing tolerance of radial fans like this and you can pack them in like sardines. They're really hard to starve for air.",Positive
AMD,"That's not a server card.  Server cards don't have their own fans.  There's no need, since the fans are included with the server chassis.  All server expansion cards rely on server chassis airflow for proper cooling, and almost all of them do this without adding any additional fans.",Neutral
AMD,Most server cards I've seen are completely passive. Just a heatsink with open flow front to back and the super noisy chassis-mounted intake fans just blast air through everything.  Blowers are more like workstation cards IMO.,Neutral
AMD,"That's not standard for server cards, server cards are passively cooled. Blower is standard for workstations.",Neutral
AMD,"I don't like your tone, but whatever.   You are right, I mixed that up.",Negative
AMD,"Of course it can game. It's an RX 9070 XT under the hood, just with 2x VRAM capacity and normally-sized cooler.",Neutral

AMD,"No doubt ""about"" it.",Neutral
AMD,"Not in the context of VRAM. You have two boxes 32cm long. Can you fit 45cm long figurine? Answer is no, it will just hit the side of one of the boxes. You can however fit two 32cm long figurines.  In ""AI"" world it works kinda similar. 2 cards of 32GB each can sometimes act as 2 devices with 32GB, can sometimes be used as 64GB with caveats OR actually behave as a 64GB VRAM pool.  For instance image generative AI has very dense, linear models. They have to fit in full. So for their purpose you have 2 GPUs, each with around 640GB/s bandwidth and 32GB memory each. You can produce twice as much AI slop by running 2 applications at once but you can't speed up producing a single one or use a really large model that exceeds 32GB.  In order to treat it as 64GB you would need to go over PCI Express bus instead and transfer data back and forth between cards. Which at x8/x8 configuration would be 32GB/s. So you can but it would absolutely slaughter your performance. Cards have to constantly communicate as each does the entire workflow.  But LLMs are different. You can split a 64GB model into 2 chunks of 32GB each. Card #1 does part of the workload, then it hands it to #2. They don't actually talk nearly as much. So for the biggest part 2 cards of 32GB = 64GB, they don't rely so much on PCI-Express.  And in the professional world there are also connections superior to PCIe. Nvidia H100 has like 3TB/s internal bandwidth but it also has 900GB/s NVLink. So if you need to stack 2 together - you can and performance penalty is not nearly as much as on consumer grade cards.  So yea, 2x32GB in PC world can sometimes mean it's still 32GB :)",Neutral
AMD,It's not passive cooling.  They won't cool passively.  They required airflow.  The fan is just part of the server chassis rather than part of the card.,Negative
AMD,"There is no such thing as a passively cooled server cards. There are server cards that come with fans, and then there are server cards that expects you to provide the fan. Both are very actively cooled.",Neutral

AMD,"Yes, it doesn’t come with a fan. Yes, on the spec sheet it is advertised as passive since it doesn’t come with a fan. It’s still a 350W card and expects either the server case or for you to provide the fans.  No heat sink can cool 350W with zero airflow.",Neutral
AMD,"It's def better for that no doubt, but i rather not compromise on quality. Instead, avoid giving personal data when using Gemini. Instead of saying ""i take this medical pill what would happen if i increase the dose"" say ""what would happen if a person taking this medical pill increases the dose"" etc. etc.",Neutral
AMD,Only person who said no airflow is you.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, that’s because that is what passive cooling is. Transferring heat to air with no requirement of air circulation. i.e. smartphones and Mac’s. If the case adds a fan to the heat sink, or if you add your own fan, it’s no longer passive cooling. It’s just advertised as passive cooling since it does not come with a heat sink fan.

AMD,"That's not an ""issue"" that can be ""fixed"", it's an artifact of how they set up the chiplet architecture. Perhaps in some future Ryzen chips they'll add a direct CCD interconnect, but that's a huge change that won't come in a minor update to Zen 5.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah I'm not sure how this will work in practice. 3D vcache is great but if there is a ton of lag die to die still, I don't see the point. Maybe sub tasks can get by on the cache in the other core and not cause a backlog of calls to the ram, which aids the first core? I dunno.",Negative

AMD,"AM6? Why? New motherboards, new ram and CPU stock issues, even if they don't delay the rumoured 2028 launch i bet the prices will be kinda prohibitive, making it ""smarter"" to actually buy in 2030.

If something can use N cores well for longer times, you can take 30 seconds to set that process exe to 0-31.",Neutral
AMD,"The dual CCD latency is the result of the SerDes (serializer deserializer) that AMD uses to send data between chiplets.  It's already been confirmed that AMD is moving away from that and to a ""Sea of wires"" for Zen 6 using TSMC INFO-OS.    It entirely removes the latency penalty from the SerDes, improves power consumption, saves die space, improves bandwidth, and is more flexible.  This has good implications not only for multi-CCD chips but also the IO die and all it's associated functions.  The more disaggregated the chiplet design, the more it stands to benefit from this change.  Intel in particular could use this with how bad latency harms 15th gen's performance.",Neutral
AMD,"yeah, i know. that's why i was so confused. 'fixed' in this context is just-- how are they going to make a dual CCD worth it? it negates too much. we'll see if they have something. the next chips sound like they'll be pretty nice at the very least",Negative
AMD,This is supposedly in the works for zen 6 already,Neutral
AMD,"It depends on what kind of work you want it to do. Most games are not designed to utilise more than 8 cores, that is why you really only get the downside of a second CCD. But a lot of intense computation tasks are not only happy to use as many cores as you want them to, they also do not depend as heavily as games on core-to-core communication.  With Zen 4 the common wisdom was that X3D was really only good for games, but as Zen 5 lowered the clock speed penalty a good chunk of the tasks that on Zen 4 saw no improvement or regression with X3D, do now run faster on Zen 5 X3D CCDs.",Neutral
AMD,So 10800X3D? Needs more 0s.,Neutral
AMD,"For desktop Ryzen?  Not likely.  Those went 1xxx 2xxx 3xxx 5xxx 7xxx 9xxx.    10xxx will be some sort of mid-gen or APU lineup like the 6xxx and 8xxx stuff, and then either they go 11xxx or come up with another naming scheme (guaranteed to be more confusing, and if released before the AI bubble bursts, with AI in the name)",Neutral

AMD,I know AM6 no early than 2030 for DDR6 at least.,Neutral
AMD,I thought the trend was simply a new socket when there is a new RAM generation,Neutral
AMD,AM6 won't be dependent on PCIE6.  AM6 will come when DDR6 comes.  Just like AM5 arrived with DDR5 and AM4 with DDR4 and AM3 with DDR3 etc.,Neutral
AMD,"But still a 5800x3d would be enough until Zen6. My only remorse would be is if early B850 and xX70 boards will support Zen6 but with a compromise regarding RAM, because most boards are 6 layer. Also we don't know what B950/X970 boards will bring for Zen6 or in general. Moreover I also think that newer RAM sticks will be released for Zen6 higher speeds, possibly for EXPO 2.0 too. Buying new RAM and a board to deliver the most for Zen6 potential?   AM4 wasn't smooth, early boards had questionable support for ryzen 5000 for example. Buying a new board kills the principle of upgrade ability.  That's why I ask God for willpower ignore that impulsive behavior of buying so early. I am too enthusiastic when it comes to PC hardware.

AMD,Using the 5800X currently paired with a 5090 and gaming at 4K on a 240Hz screen. Please excuse my ignorance but upgrading from the 5800X to the 9800/9850X3D would be that noticeable in performance uplift in your opinion?,Neutral

AMD,ya thhts why im getting the 9800x3d now since zen 7 will be on am5,Neutral
AMD,"If I join AM6 it will be mid of AM6 at least. But you know what, we(in general) never lucky.  As soon as we buy, something better comes out or even just newer boards with better hardware support(be it faster RAM, newer CPUs, newer PCIE).  I think the smartest thing to do is to get the last supposed chipset of each platform and keep going like that.   Before I got my 5800X3D I had X570 motherboard with a Zen2 CPU. Jumping straight to X570 was a good idea, skipping all the VRM concerns of early AM4 and newer PCIE 4.0 support.  This time with Zen6, 8000Mhz RAM will be the new 6000Mhz thanks to newer memory controller, newer boards will probably have to be 8 layer boards to support higher RAM speeds better, while most 600/800 boards are 6 layers. And also bigger BIOS ROM(even though it is not a big issue).   That's why in hindsight I feel like I rushed going from 5800X3D to 9800X3D.   Which also what makes CPU support somewhat questionable on the same platform. I don't think a B650/B850 board will support last gen of CPUs on AM5 without some compromises.",Positive
AMD,"The main concern for those who are looking to upgrade when possible, is whether current boards will support higher RAM speeds with no compromises(speaking about the avg with, 6 layer boards).   And also possible newer DDR5 RAM sticks.",Neutral
AMD,"No I don't think you are correct, as far as we can tell.  You are correct that *either* CCD will work fine, but nothing we know tells us that *both* CCDs at the same time are fine. A game split between two CCDs will still have the penalty of inter-CCD communications.  So we might as well still need to do core parking for games - the only difference is that you can part any of the two CCDs.  Or maybe not. We just don't know.",Neutral

AMD,> So boring and does nothing for people that do more than play video games  So you believe nobody is buying the EPYC with 3D cache and up to 96 cores?,Negative
AMD,"I think you're uninformed.   gaming is a very profitable niche, thus AMD focuses on advertising the gaming performance.   However, modern workflows are commonly bottlenecked by how fast you can feed the CPU with instructions and data, winRAR is a good example because compressors tends to use complex data structures to store patterns (hash tables and balanced binary trees)  The majority of times execution cores are fast enough for what we need, but memory isn't fast enough to feed them.",Neutral
AMD,"Multiple, but [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wdQpVcL_a4) video from JayzTwoCents explains it pretty well.   It shows what to look for, where to look and how to check if it is indeed working properly.",Positive

AMD,I would love to see that but my gut says 12 but we shall see.,Positive
AMD,Zen6 consumer will only have 12. Datacentre will have 16 Zen6C.  I doubt we'll see 16C CCD on desktop until the gen after (which allegedly won't be zen)  Maybe we'll see a desktop prosumer part (threadripper) with the zen6C cores to maximize those cores!,Neutral

AMD,"Nah. DDR5 was planned for 2018, released in 2020 and actually was available in \~2021. AM5 released in 2022.  They still have to decide whether we are going for CAMM2 or not.  There are 2 years between each gen of Zen CPUs. Zen 4 2022, Zen5 2024.   Zen6 in late 2026/early 2027. While Zen7 is still possible on AM5 because the major changes are in Zen6.   Even if Zen7 is not on AM5, you still have to give like 2 years between generations, so the earliest if they want to squeeze is 2029.",Neutral

AMD,"Ah, ok. I see how it is. Thanks. ✌️",Positive
AMD,"Yes, Zen 6 is the ""big one"" but that also makes it possible that a minor upgrade for Zen 7 will be sufficient to move to AM6 because there will be other selling points of the new platform beyond pure IPC/clocks. Even so, that is going to be 2028 earliest I think.  Not worth waiting for AM6 if you're itchy now. I will be waiting though because my AM4 system still thumps (3700X upgraded to 5800X3D).",Neutral
AMD,I will wait until everything is released so I can see   9800X3D + DDR5 6000  vs 10800X3D + DDR5 8000  Performance then price will dictate where I go.,Neutral
AMD,"that’s for 1:2 mode tho, which is more efficient then 1:1 mode. 1:1 mode uses more voltage. (vsoc, vddg ccd, vddg iod) the higher you increase ram speed.   & if you’re into tuning ram then you’ll also need to account for that aswell.",Neutral

AMD,"They lose out on clock speeds and X3D option if they use dense cores. As far as I'm aware, AMD isn't attempting any mixes of regular and dense cores, so it would be all dense and lower clocks and no X3D options or all regular cores with higher clocks and X3D options.",Neutral

Personally I want to skip to mid AM6, but I feel like I am going to upgrade to the last best AM5 CPU for as cheap as possible.",Positive
AMD,I am assuming yields will be poor at first on 16 core chiplets.  Not to mention the current gen focused on server chips with the zen design.  Thats why everyone hated the consumer launch prior to x3d parts.  They might do that again. More money in the data center and that is a reason to go as big as possible.,Negative
AMD,You are thinking about gaming. All real cores would be much faster for several workloads. Amd can take a small frequency hit and still win.,Positive
AMD,"Enterprise CPUs are always cloaked lower.   All Zen 5 CCDs are the exact same, but Epyc CCDs cloks can be as low as 2.6ghz. You gotta remember, even though the Eypc CCDs are clocked at 2.6ghz, there is 16 of them in 1 package + 1 IOD. Atm at those clocks, they use 500+ watts.  AMD has to cloak them lower for power management and thermal management.  And while Dense has less CCDs, they still have more Cores and cache to power and thermally manage one 1 package. If they were clocked, like consumer CCDs, they would use beyond 1000 watts of power, and thats 1000 watts of heat that needs to be handled for 1 CPU. And 1 enterprise chasis can have 4 of these chips in it. Thats 4000 watts of power and heat to manage in 1 chasis, just for the CPUs.  Put 52 of these in a 1 rack, 200 Kilowatts for 1 rack, just to power and manage heat of the CPUs  And thats not even including the GPUs that might be used in the same systems, with AI being as popular as it is right now.  But, stick 2 of those CCDs on a consumer CPU for 32 cores, you could clock them higher and it would use at most, 200 watts.  > Next generation Ryzen consumer CPU's CCD's will be on N2 nodes, not N3. The IOD will be on N3.  Ok i was mistaken on this, I assumed AMD would just the gradual node jump like they have done before. Didn't expect them to skip 3nm for consumers.",Neutral
AMD,"It's all subjective some way, but its definitely acceptable for what I want to play and how I play it. I don't mind turning down settings for competitive games, but in general I do like high framerates and high settings. I play at 1440p and have a 240 Hz monitor. I have the card tuned to run +20% power limit, core at 2600 MHz actual and memory at stock 2250 (if I turn it up more I actually lose performance).   When I say fighting for its life is that in all scenarios its at constant 99% utilization, and some games like BF6 all out warfare or Monster Hunter Wilds it will occasionally perform less than I would like it to. I considered a 4090/5090 but frankly I just can't justify the cost.",Neutral

But I have become extremely pleasantly surprised by how AMD for the last 5 years has structured their company in my opinion to actually truly rival or beat Nvidia in the near future. As of this year, I believe AMD has surpassed a very crucial threshold that will leave Intel in the dust and become the next truly big player. The patents they have for chips coming down the line check out from a logical and practical standpoint that they will easily deliver more performance than what AMD has even advertised and expand on physical architecture. While if you compare what Intel has put out patent-wise wise it looks like a kindergartener took a whack at it. Literally 0 physical innovations and 100% software ""upgrades"". That is a red flag to me that Intel's fabs are too old and too behind to produce anything of actual modern quality and are forced to optimize older tech to run faster like it's new which never works as well as building it properly from the ground up like AMD.",Positive

AMD,"As much as I'd really love for this to be an international release of an amazing budget gaming CPU, I doubt it'll be as rosy as it seems at first glance.  Historically, the 5600X3D released as a Microcenter US-exclusive (if you can even call it that) release, as did the 7600X3D. The 5500X3D was rumoured to exist back in 2024 but only released in the past few months as a Latin America exclusive. Only the 5700X3D came to international fruition, and it's a few tiers above this chip, so I wouldn't consider it all that equivalent (against say, the 5500X3D). As for the non-X3D 7500(F) for the majority of its life it was an exclusive release as well and Westerners could only get them via Aliexpress, eBay or any other unofficial third party resellers. That's changed recently, it seems the 7500F is now mostly available globally, but in a fair amount of countries it's still more expensive than the 7600, and it's taken 3 years since the launch of Zen 4 to get here.  AMD's kept AM5 at a relatively high price point compared to budget AM4 and I'd reckon it intentional. Why would they suddenly release a budget X3D CPU to bring down the price of AM5 to consumers when Intel's effectively meaningless in the gaming segment already?  Aside from that, AMD historically doesn't seem to want to release budget X3D CPUs internationally, and you can't really blame them. It'd take away 7800X3D and 9800X3D customers if they see a budget X3D chip doing 90% of the performance for half the cost. That could be different in places like Latin America though, where there could be a price gap AMD could fill with a budget X3D CPU.

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance.

HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming.

Ironically the 9070 performance was identical with a 9700X and a 9800X3D.  So it's actually kind of the reverse, gaming reviewers painted Arrow Lake in the worst possible light.",Neutral
AMD,What do you mean by gaslighting in this case?,Neutral
AMD,"The answer depends on whether or not you're a ""next-gen AI gamer"" (apparently that means 1080p avg fps with a RTX 5090).",Neutral
AMD,I doubt they would give false numbers. Those are probably what you get with the setup they list in fine print. Also they pretty clearly show the 3dx parts are faster in gaming. But they have probably picked examples that show them in a good light.   There is nothing wrong per se in the arrow lake lineup. In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all. The issue that destroyed the image of arrow lake is that the previous generation was often faster in gaming. That made every reviewer give it bad overall reviews.,Neutral
AMD,Wait till refresh comes out in December... Memory latency lower and performance boosted. Price also lower... Wish it could come to the old chips but it architecturally cant. :(,Neutral
AMD,"generally they cherry pick, so maybe the demo they use is process heavy with minimal I/O (arrow's biggest performance hit is memory movement). if you manage to keep memory movement low core performance is actually really good on arrow lake. it just gets massacred by d2d and NGU latency, which they don't get a pass for but its unfortunate that decent core designs are held back severely by packaging.",Negative
AMD,"there is just no way dude lol  even their comparisons make no sense, 265K = 9800X3D / 265KF = 9700X? lol? how would that even be possible",Negative
AMD,Honestly it's hard to get real conversation with people who fanboying Amd so hard. Why people can't be normal when we talk about Intel and Nvidia? *smh,Negative
AMD,"The base clock rates, my assumption how it boosts during heavily multi-threaded tasks, is like 60%-80% higher on both core types.",Neutral
AMD,Nova Lake bLLC about to ruin Amd X3D party.,Neutral
AMD,Look at the last slide. Intel's source is TPU's review data which if anything is a less than ideal config for arrow considering it's only DDR5-6000. I'm honestly surprised they didn't pull from one of the outlets that did 8000 1.4v XMP+200S boost coverage.,Negative
AMD,I always wondered if Intel marketing budget is higher than the R&D budget,Neutral
AMD,Intel Arrow Lake is much cheaper than Amd Zen 5.,Positive
AMD,Genuine question how often do you or even the average person keep their motherboards when upgrading the CPU? IMO the platform longevity argument is stupid,Negative

AMD,Hardware unboxed isn't a reliable source.,Neutral
AMD,"As a real world example, I upgraded my primary system from a 14700k to a 265k recently. My other desktop is a ryzen 7900 (non x, 65 watt tdp)  Compiling my os takes 6 minutes on the 7900, 10 minutes on the 265k, 10 minutes on a 3950x, and 16 minutes on the 14700k.   That is not in windows, but my os which does not have thread director or custom scheduling for e cores. (So going to be worse than windows or Linux)   All the numbers except the 7900 are with the same ssd, psu, custom water loop.  The motherboard and cpu changed between Intel builds and the 3950x was the previous build before the 14700k.   The e core performance significantly improved in arrow lake.  It’s now keeping up with 16 core am4 parts in the worst possible scenario for it.  If the scheduler was smarter, I think it would be very close to the 7900.   In windows, it’s pretty close in games I play on frame rate to the old chip. A few are actually faster.",Neutral
AMD,"> And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  Yeah, 10% less performance when frequency matched is quite a lot.",Neutral
AMD,Telling people that its performance is better than it actually is?,Negative
AMD,The ones with similar pricing not performance,Neutral
AMD,"True, except AM5 supported all cpus 7000, 9000 and will support the newest one. So not exactly true per se, because you need a new motherboard every time and those on AM5 can upgrade cpu without buying a board. Imagine if someone was on 13400F and wanted to buy lets say 285K? Well, you need a new board. So it depends what “cheaper” is seen as.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep. We all see the patterns here. Gamers nexus, HUB, LTT and most big name they all keep mocking Intel, even when Intel did good job to bring improvements to their products like fixing Arrow Lake gaming performance but those ""tech reviewer"" decided to be blind, they don't even want to revisit Intel chip and benchmark it, they don't even want to educate their viewers.    At the same time they keep overhyping Amd products to the moon like they own the stock, it's obvious now who is the real reviewer and who is fraud reviewer using their own popularity and big headline to spread their propaganda for their own benefits. They are just as worse as shady company!",Negative
AMD,"Platform longevity isn't stupid lol. There's a reason why am4 is one of the best selling and one of the best platforms of all time. The fact that you can go from a 1700x to a 5800x3d on the same mobo for 85% more performance is crazy good value. You can say that all you want but there's a reason why in the diy market everyone is buying amd over intel. People know arrow lake is doa where as am5 actually has a future, which is why everyone is flocking to the 9800x3d in droves.  Zen 7 is rumored to be on am5 as well. Meaning that am6 would come out in 2030/2031. If that's true am5 lived for around 8/9 years.  That's insane value to get out of one socket.",Positive
AMD,Quite common for AM4 in my experience.,Neutral
AMD,"My brother went from 1700X to 3700X to 5800X3D on AM4, so 10 years next year? I plan on upgrading to 3D cpu probably 9600X3D once its out or maybe 7800X3D (something more affordable but still somewhat better). Kinda want better 1% lows tbh, but maybe I’ll just wait for next ones unsure.",Neutral
AMD,"How is it stupid? On one hand, intel sockets used only 3 gens from 12th-14th while on the other hand amd has not only used 7000-9000 but will also be using zen 6. I don't think you realize just how big of a hassle changing motherboards are",Negative
AMD,"I upgrade my motherboard usually because of cpu socket. Thinking of going AMD. I build my PCs for myself, my wife and my kid. Lots of floating parts in this house could use the platform longevity.",Positive
AMD,I originally had a Ryzen 5 3600 and am now on a 5700x3d so it’s pretty relevant I’d say. Of course it’s anecdotal but I don’t think it’s too uncommon,Neutral
AMD,"I agree with you, it’s daft, no doubt about it. But you’ve got to factor in that people can be daft too. Most tend to skimp, only to end up buying another middling CPU the following year, and then again after that. And so the cycle trundles on.  When I buy PC parts, I usually go for the best available. Provided the price is reasonably sane. I picked up a 9900K seven years ago and it’s still holding its own. Is it on par with the 9800X3D? Of course not. But it’s still a very capable bit of kit. Next time I upgrade, I’ll go top shelf again.",Neutral
AMD,"They frequently revisit products and test old hardware, but naturally that's not going to be their focus. Channels with that focus like RandomGaminginHD fill that niche.",Neutral
AMD,Sooo they are in the YouTube space for the money not for the love of tech,Neutral
AMD,"So true. After all they are reviewer, it's their job to revisit something if it's worth to benchmark due to improvements.   Didn't they said they want to educate their viewers? If so then why being lazy? This is obvious they just care about making big headline which makes more money for them. It's BS!",Negative
AMD,"If only the Arc B770 can beat the RX 9070XT with performance and features, then I definitely stay on Intel's side, but RN I doubt it",Neutral
AMD,"Even accepting that as true, I don’t think it changes the main point I was making. Arrow Lake has probably improved versus a year ago. It’s probably not as good as intel is making out. A good third party reviewer would be needed to determine by how much, yet it’s probably not worth their money and time to test it.   So the truth is probably in between what Intel is saying here and what the state of things was 6 months ago.",Negative
AMD,Isn’t that just either lying or exaggerating?   I know those words don’t “go hard” and are “low key” boring.   But I think some internet buzzwords are just overused or badly applied.,Negative

AMD,The 5800x 3d costs anything between 450 (time of launch) and 300. With that kind of money - you can literally buy a cpu + a mobo bundle. There is no value in the platform upgradability argument. You can literally buy a 13600k and a brand new mobo for cheaper than the cost of the 5800x 3d alone.,Negative
AMD,YouTube has created an entire industry not just for gaming but for everything else where all these people rely on the YouTube algorithm and have figured out how to exploit it and bitch and complain whenever YouTube tries to change things up.

AMD,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Neutral

AMD,"Most commenters are wrong or didn’t read all the articles. Nvidia wants some custom SKUs of server chips to pair with its data center GPUs, and Intel wanted a better solution for pc parts for the GPU tiles.   NVIDIA is NOT getting an x86 license, nor do they want one. In case you haven’t noticed, Nvidia is a $4T company largely on sales of data center GPUs, sales of which were 10x the gaming segment. Profit/earnings ratio of data center is even higher than the 10x.   In my opinion, the only reason for Intel to use RTX chiplets on pc parts is so they can have a few skus for mobile gaming. Lower end laptop chips would still use Xe cores.  This solves NONE of intel’s structural issues - they need, in this order  1. Major foundry customers  2. Regain server market share 3. Data center GPU offerings 4. Move all pc chiplets back to Intel nodes and start to fill up the fabs again",Neutral

AMD,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive. I know they have a lot of tricks up their sleeves still, like designing HBM memory onto the die (how Vega was supposed to be originally) and unified memory (soldered down, see the new AI branded chips).",Negative
AMD,Ohh noooerrrrrrrrr,Neutral
AMD,"Actually this may be good for AMD and I will tell you why: Open source drivers.

Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.

AMD,Intel doesn't have a current gen A310 competitor either.,Neutral
AMD,Theres no way that nvidia is gonna let intel keep producing entry level gpus that directly compete with their own. I know their deals are in regards to apus and to compete with strix halo but nvidia is not gonna invest into a company with a competitor to their gpus.

AMD,"3D cache will eventually become full of assets and dip, if and onlyif IMC is bottlenecked by random memory access.  - the ability for cache to transfer data from memory, to IMC, to cache has a FPS hit (cache hit-rate). This is due to the bottleneck of a chiplet-based IOD: compromising memory latency with cache hit-rate. Eventually the cache fills and relying on IMC to feed the cores anyway.  You can easily test this by monitoring 1% lows and increasing memory latency (lowering DDR4 B-die clocks/DDR5 hynix and increasing timings) to see how Cache holds up when full of assets while memory is being bottlenecked-   What games need is 10-12 P-Cores and an IMC capable of high speeds.

AMD,"I said IPC of Zen 4 is the SAME and weaker than Zen 4 is weaker than Skymont in IPC. No more no less. As for clocks, the core scales to max 5.2ghz (default 4.6ghz), certainly overall slower than Zen 4. IPC is a comparison about throughput at a given clockspeed. Its a give to compare you will need to match the clocks.  Funny you you should mention latencies, considering that core to core (even accross clusters), latencies of Skymont are better than Lion Cove? So if latency is the issue, it has nothing to do with Skymont and everything to do with the trash uncore they have based on the Meteorlake SOC. Even workstation Crestmont on a different package performs better. Furthermore skymont IPC is measured based on Arrowlake. Arrowlake is worse latency than Raptorlake and Zen already. Latencies have been accounted for.",Negative

AMD,"Regarding the cache optimizations you pointed out, I have a question. Can you test all APO supported games you own and capture the utilization of the E-cores ?  My understanding is that Intel is keeping 1 E-core per cluster active and parking the remaining 3 E-cores. So the lone E-core of each cluster has full access to the 4mb shared L2. For the i9 they can have 4 such solitary E-cores that have their own cache and hence do not touch the L3 cache. The 4 E-cores handle background task while the 8 P-cores with the full 36mb L3 cache deal with the games.  Please correct me if I am wrong.  Also, what cpu cooler do you use ?",Neutral

AMD,"It's capable of a few things, but the main mechanism from what I've seen is that it temporarily disables three out of four cores in each E-core cluster by forcing them into the lowest power state. The result is that the remaining active core has access to each cluster's full L2 cache (2MB on 12th-gen, 4MB on 13th/14th-gen). L2 cache isn't shared with P-cores (L3 is global), so this can really minimize E-core cache evictions before they're forced into slower memory, and games do love themselves some cache.  It's a genuinely clever way of maximizing available resources and I really wish they'd allow user control over its features, but it seems to be pretty tightly leashed to/by the team that developed it. It obviously wouldn't benefit every situation, such as particularly low/high thread occupancy situations, but it's pretty rough to have the option tied to quarterly updates for one or two specific games.",Neutral

AMD,They are they came up with ML for their upscaller before the red team did and even better than FSR as a dump upscaler and they also did a good RT implementation. But the hardware still has raw horse power issues and they already use a big die for what it can do.  In the 80's or they shammed The DEC Alpha team on subnormal floating point operations with the 8087 FPU. Intel was doing way more precession without having to round so earlier on a consumer FPU while the Alpha CPU was a Mainframe one.

Remember AMD didn't have any ai hardware for their first 2 gens on RDNA and RDNA 3 didn't have enough for FSR4 either. It's not that intel were better at producing a ML upscaler. They just had the hardware for it from the get go so they could implement it quicker.  They did make Xess though which is miles ahead of FSR 3 even on AMD systems (on average.

AMD,It’s the least you should get after not getting FSR4.,Neutral
AMD,You'd use it over FSR if that's available too?,Neutral

AMD,"I mean it gives better image quality than FSR 3.1, so I know I definitely do.",Positive
AMD,Sure. The image quality is generally better. I'd only use FSR if I was trying to squeeze every last drop of performance out of my GPU since it's faster than Xess DP4a. But Xess will be tried first.,Positive
AMD,Do you have a link? Anything I have seen points to the GPU using Xess DP4A unless it's an ARC GPU. So it supports RDNA2 and newer on AMD and Turing and newer on Nvidia.  https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-xess-compatibility-nvidia-amd/  And I do literally run Xess on my 6900XT (currently using it for F7 Rebirth through Optiscaler).

AMD,where did amd touch you bud?,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah more and more games are adding DLSS support, so I'm not sure when I would need Xess",Neutral
AMD,"That's true but in edge cases where even the lightest Xess option is still too heavy, FSR may still deliver a better overall experience.   E.g. CP2077 on the steam Deck in Dog Town. When I was testing some stuff out (trying to see how close I could get my Deck to the Switch 2 build) I found Xess to be a unsuitable. Even on the lightest Xess mode, the performance hit was a bit too noticeable. FSR doesn't look as good as Xess but it runs better and you can get away with a bit more upscaling artifacting on the Decks relatively small screen. Just rendering at a lower res and letting the screen upscale was also a solid option in that scenario.  As I say though, that's an edge case where you really just need outright speed. If your GPU doesn't support DLSS or FSR4 then using Xess makes sense in the vast majority of cases.",Neutral
AMD,Are you sure you're not getting the DP4A/Shader Model 6.4 and Arc exclusive version mixed up? DP4a was added to Shader Model 6.4. https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki/Shader-Model-6.4.  There is a separate path of Xess that is better than DP4A but that only works on Arc Cards.,Neutral

This time not only optimization for Arc GPU, but also for Intel Core CPU like proper CPU scheduling for P and E cores to make sure the game runs on the right thread.

AMD,"Most games are optimized for consoles which are natively eight cores, and a lot are ported over to PC and so you basically need eight fast cores in whatever CPU you happen to have, and the rest don't really do much.

AMD,"Yes, but in games, it's the P-cores that are meant to be utilized. Also, more than eight cores or 16 threads aren't really necessary for gaming. The 9950x3d isn't faster, than the 9900x3d.  My point is that the space taken up by the E-cores could instead be used for additional cache, not?",Neutral
AMD,I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it. Anyhow if that's true the large L3 should be even more helpful for things like gaming as it will keep those higher latency hits down.

AMD,Process lasso can let you just designate by task so the E cores can do background and side jobs. People use process lasso on the 7950x3d to make the X3D chiplet run games with those 8 cores and the other 8 core chiplet for everything else.,Neutral
AMD,What issue did you run into with a 9800x3d? It has one CCD and no small cores,Neutral
AMD,"Nowadays there are very few cases where disabling E cores is extremely beneficial, sometimes they are a detriment to performance but more often than not they are useful. Not to mention the E core design team is more competent than the P core team and are quickly catching up in performance.    The E cores in Alder Lake had relatively poor ST performance but in Arrow Lake they are much faster and closer to the P cores in raw performance. Every new generation the gap keeps shrinking and it will make the disabling of E cores less and less relevant.    Sometimes the Windows scheduler will wrongly assign an E core to a ST bound task, even if a P core is available, but it doesn't happen often enough to be a serious issue.",Neutral
AMD,"yes, but not because of windows scheduling - its because you can OC higher with them off - better temps and easier stability - some people disable HT for the same.",Neutral
AMD,They don't pay attention,Negative
AMD,"No. Intel needs to do what Amd did and add seperate bLLC just for gaming. As long as latency is reduced to the L3 cache including bLLC, gaming performance will definitely increase as 285K and 9950x have similar performance in both gaming and productivity with small lead going to Amd. But x3d totally dominates ARL beacsue of the obvious huge cache difference and lower overall latency to their cache implementation.",Neutral

I'm not surprised if the E cores can bottleneck the performance even further, most likely some of the game's heaviest threads get (wrongly) assigned to the E cores.    The scheduling in W11 has been significantly improved over the last few years but it's not 100% perfect either. Legacy software in particular, which typically utilizes 1 core, often ends up running in an E core and as a result you can't take advantage of the higher ST performance a P core provides. In that case you need stuff like Process Lasso to fix the problem. It doesn't happen very often but when it does it's very annoying.",Negative
AMD,"Yup.   >. Then as you look forward, to our next-generation product for client after that, Nova Lake will actually have die both inside and outside for that process. So, you'll actually see compute tiles inside and outside.  Q4 2024 earnings call.",Neutral
AMD,"That seems really strange, since ARL was designed for both 18A and N3, and they just went with N3 at the time.  Now that 18A is ready, and capacity is reserved for Intel themselves, you'd think NVL would just plain be fabbed there.  Maybe the 18A fabs are so busy with Clearwater Lake orders, that they would go with TSMC again?  That seems like something they couldn't have known in 2024.",Neutral

AMD,I would love to see a Nova Lake-A (strix halo like) APU with an 8+16 tile + 20Xe3 cores which is equal to 2560 FP32 lanes or 40 AMD CU's with 16-32mb of memory side cache to handle igpu bandwidth demands,Positive
AMD,"Wonder what node such a product, if it does exist, would use for the iGPU tile.   AFAIK, rumor is that the iGPU tile for the standard parts would be on 18A or an 18A variant. However, if this is a flagship part, I would assume they would be willing to pay the extra cost to use N2...   However that would also presumably involve porting the architecture over to another node, which I don't think Intel has the resources, or wants to go through the effort, to do so.   Also wonder if such a product will finally utilize the ADM cache that has been rumored since like, forever.   And this is a bit of a tangent, but I swear at this point in the leak cycle for a new Intel product, there's always usually a ton of different skus that are leaked that may or may not launch - right now we have NVL bLLC, NVL standard, and now this, and a bunch of them end up not launching (whether they were cut internally, or the leaks were just made up). So it would be pretty interesting to see if any of the more specialized rumored NVL skus end up actually launching.",Neutral

AMD,The 7850HS can't compete with the Xe2 igpu because it's bandwidth starved.   The 8mb of memory side cache insulating the 4mb of L2 from main memory allows the Xe2 Arc 140V igpu in LL clocked at 1950mhz to beat the RDNA 3.5 890m clocked at 2950mhz as it only has 4mb of L2 as a last level of cache before hitting memory.

AMD,I will see the performance envelope of PTL U and decide should dump my LNL or not,Neutral
AMD,"The low volume part of that quote is important. If you're making heaps of them, each can take up a little bit of the startup costs for that design. If you only make a few, those costs get concentrated on what you do make.  Low volume also means a single defect is promotionally more of your possible units, and hits the margins harder. You do get more total defects in a larger run, but at sufficiently high quantities of those defects, you start making lower bins to recover some of the defects. If you hardly make the volume to cover one widespread SKU, you aren't likely to have enough to make a cheaper one with any degree of availability. At some point you hit a threshold where it's not worth selling what would be a lower bin because there's not enough of them.",Neutral

AMD,"Intel has had plans for big ass L4 cache for almost a decade now, just that it never made it past the design board.  Supposed to be marketed as Adamantium. But it got ZBB’d every time I suppose due to cost.  For Intel to implement Adamantium, regular manufacturing yield has to be good enough I.e cost is low so they can splurge on L4.  Of course now they are forced to go this way irrespective of cost. I’d love 16p + L4 CPU.",Negative

AMD,"Even though it's not stacked, I believe it's still going to fix the last level cache latency issue MTL and ARL have.   Ryzen CPUs have lower L3 latency than Intel because each CCX gets their own independent L3, unlike Intel's shared L3. Now in NVL, the BLLC configuration will replace half of the P-core and E-core tiles with L3, so possibly giving the existing cores/tiles their own independent L3, improving latency and bandwidth over shared L3.  But one thing intrigues me. If this cache level has lower latency than shared L3, wouldn't this more properly be called L2.5 or something below L3 rather than last level cache? Will NVL even still have shared L3 like the previous Intel CPUs? I know the rumor that it will have shared L2 per two cores, but we know nothing of the L3 configuration.",Neutral
AMD,"> On one hand, this shouldn't cause any thermal and Fmax implications like 3D stacking has created for AMD's chips, however doing this would prob also make the latency hit of increasing L3 capacity worse too.

AMD,Intel managed to run Sandy Bridge's ring bus clock speeds at core clocks which resulted in 30 cycles of L3 latency.   Haswell disaggreated core and ring clocks allowing for additional power savings.   Arrow Lake's L3 latency is 80 cycles with a ring speed of 3.8ghz,Neutral
AMD,"I'd like to see the HEDT X-series come back too, but Intel would have to come up with something that would be competitive in that area.  It's not hard to see why Intel dropped the series when you take a look at the Sapphire Rapids Xeon-W lineup they would have likely been based off of.  I think AMD would also do well to offer something that's a step above the Ryzen lineup, rather than a leap above it like the current Threadrippers.",Neutral

While working on his PC, I'd notice a series of odd and random hiccups. For example, double clicking a window to maximize it would cause micro freezes. His monitor runs at 240Hz, and the cursor moves very smoothly, but dragging a window around felt like it was refreshing at 60Hz. Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.  I did my due diligence on his AMD setup: updated the BIOS and chipset drivers, enabled EXPO profile, made sure Game Bar was enabled, set the power mode to Balanced.

AMD,"That channel has a lot of videos and even on this specific video it would help if you point the specific time you're referring to.  Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.  So by virtue of their fast memory Macs are easily 3x to 8x faster than PC on LLMs.  The rest is quite different though which is why what benchmark is important.",Neutral

The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough. So I expect the next-gen CPUs (Zen 6 and Nova Lake) to be quad-channel by default (~200GB/s with DDR5) so they are at least in the same ballpark as M4 chip (but still 2x slower than M4 Pro and Max).  I also expect more soldered LPDDR5 builds in the coming year.",Neutral

I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.

AMD,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.

Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.

AMD,"u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  You're absolutely correct about VROC on X299 being discontinued. Intel moved VROC for X299 platforms into sustaining mode within the past two years and has shifted focus toward Intel RST (Rapid Storage Technology) for consumer applications. While VROC is no longer actively developed, it remains supported in sustaining mode for existing users, which means NVMe drives that were released during VROC's active development period (roughly 2017-2022) should still function properly. However, newer drives may work but won't receive official validation or certification.
