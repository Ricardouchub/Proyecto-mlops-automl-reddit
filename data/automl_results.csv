Intel,"3050 performance at half the power, can't argue with that.  I do wonder how long it will be before the low-end dGPU disappears entirely from laptops, suspect these new chips probably aint it due to price but it's presumably coming.",Neutral
Intel,"While Geekbench's OpenCL isnt super popular for GPU testing;  I still cant believe a mainstream integrated GPU is actually competing with laptop 3050Ti, and these results still aren't with final optimizations!  by the time Panther Lake comes out, Intel claiming that its as fast as laptop RTX 4050 might actually be true lol",Negative
Intel,Are these better than Ryzen igpu? How do they compare to RTX 4050 AND 5050 in non demanding game?,Neutral
Intel,"I'm excited sure but if the claims are true how can anyone here expected these to be reasonably priced and sell well? If it competes with a laptop dedicated GPU it will be priced 2-3 times that laptop. The 285H isn't even that popular and its expensive, hope the 385H is affordable AND the claims are true.",Neutral
Intel,"The score is slightly above a GTX 1650 Super which in turn is slightly above a GTX 1060 which is barely matched by current most performing 128 bits iGPU (Lunar Lake / Strix Point)  Even if we expect 50% improvement compared to 890M, that's still half the performance level of a full power mobile RTX 3060.

Intel,"It'll happen eventually but they have a few issues.  First is memory bandwidth, they'd need to put a wider bus on it to address which is costly.  Second is the memory itself, they need something with higher bandwidth (but that might be addressed with LPDDR6).  To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.  Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.  A think that in 2028 big APU solutions can compete well against XX50 series and most XX60 cards.  It isn't happening before then however.",Negative

Intel,this GPU is also coming into the 355H btw (more specifically there's a Ultra X7 version of the 355H with the full 12-core GPU)     and iirc last time the 255H was pretty popular,Neutral
Intel,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.  EDIT: 8060S (Strix Halo) is \~18,000 for reference.  EDIT 2: 890M (strix point's top end) about 8,100, so the PTL 12Xe chip will smoke that.  I'm excited about it, it looks like a great chip!",Neutral

Intel,"Only sticking point seems to be cost I suppose, implementing a truly competitive iGPU looks like it will be expensive if Strix Halo is anything to go by.

Bang for buck AT HIGHER RESOLUTIONS — that’s where it’s at. And I’ve had 4090 (sold), amd 9070(sold). Never would I pay what they are asking for a 5090.

Blurs my picture even on best settings possible.",Positive
Intel,Upselling,Neutral
Intel,IMO it's probably not economical for them to do it.   Gaming laptops/handhelds are already niche enough as it is -- doesn't make sense for them to package both and for OEMs to carry both for just for a ~$1-200 delta between the units. Those who want the full GPU will just pay for it.,Negative
Intel,"You gotta remember these CPU’s don’t have multi-threading. AMD gets 16 threads out of their 8 core z1 and z2 extreme but with these core ultra’s you get one core and that’s it. A full on physical core is better than a virtual core, but the same amount of cores with multi-threading is much better than just a same core-count CPU without it. Intel are offering up to 16 cores which is 16 cores/16 threads, but generally should offer better multi-core performance vs an 8-core 16-thread. If anything it’s nice Intel have the ability to improve core count offerings without significantly raising the power requirements.   I for one veered away from the MSI Claw 8 AI+ as a standalone PC solution because it lacked the multi-core performance I needed with it only having 8 physical cores and no multi-threading. A 16-core offering is exactly what I need.",Neutral

Intel,"If anything, seems strictly worse than N3, even compared to older iterations. That's not great for a node that was supposed to go toe to toe with N2. Especially if the production cost is more in line with the latter.",Negative
Intel,"18a is initially launching with its lower power variant, which is why the only nova cpus that will use it for the compute tile are the laptop ones. The higher power variant comes later",Neutral
Intel,"Jaykihn, whose tweets these leaks are based on, says that the design characteristics cannot be extrapolated to the node itself.   So it is less likely that the clocks are limited by 18A. It is just what was decided for this particular product.",Neutral
Intel,"> […] It doesn't seem like it improved on N3 and I know that they were targeting better frequency and lower power than they got.  Well, we already had rumors of Intel struggling to hit actual intended frequency-goals, no?  Though especially the actual performance-metrics of the node will be quite sobering I think.  The power-draw of these SKUs is supposed to be a TDP of *officially* 25W – In reality, these parts are allowed to draw as much as 55W (2+0+4 or 4+0+4) and 65/80W (4+4+4 and 4+8+4) respectively.  So it must be seen, if these parts are any more efficient in daily usage, or just a side-grade to Lunar Lake.",Negative
Intel,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power. A 10-15% frequency advantage would go a long, long way towards closing gaps if it comes as a relatively small power cost.",Neutral

Intel,Laptop.,Neutral
Intel,Since when is any user determining what cores they want to use and when?,Neutral
Intel,It makes sense to have three as the low-power cores prioritize keeping the power consumption low for battery life but to achieve this they aren't attached to the ring bus which hurts performance so 8 regular E cores are also used,Neutral
Intel,">I can't say I'm entirely sold on the idea of having three core clusters humming inside my laptop.  From a user's perspective, CPU's are a blackbox and the inner-working details are irrelevant. What matters is results. They want, typically, a balance of performance, battery life, heat / fan noise, and cost, placing greater emphasis on one of these categories over the others.  The idea is that P cores = performance optizied  E cores = Area optimized  LP-E Cores = power optimized.  The theory being to have different core types focus on different parts of PPA.  E cores and LP-E cores are the same microarchitecture. Just LP-E cores are off-ring so the ring (and rest of the cores) can be powered down in light-load scenarios.  Intel's biggest problem is that looking at each of the cores, the P cores perform their designated role the worst. 200% larger than E cores for \~10% more IPC and \~15% more clockspeed is a pretty rough trade off - and by the time you've loaded all P cores and need to load E cores too, that clockspeed difference diminishes hard.  Intel's better off (and all rumors point this way) to growing the E cores slightly and making that architecture the basis of the new P and E cores (like Zen vs Zen-C)",Neutral

Intel,"And with all the issues Windows already has with the scheduler, I fully expect it to never be able to properly utilize the different cores.

Intel,Darkmont should really not be that far off Cougar Cove. Certainly not *slow*.,Negative
Intel,The E-Cores are plenty fast for most use-cases by now and there are 8 of them in there. Aren‘t they even ahead of the skylake IPC by now? 8 will be doing a great deal with a good clock frequency.  Only the 4 LP-Cores are kind of weak. But they aren‘t attached to the ring-bus and really only used for offloading low req Backgroundtasks and an idling machine. So that you can turn off the faster cores when they aren‘t necessary.  But for performant gaming and productivity it is basically a 12 core machine.,Positive
Intel,I hope there's a 4+0+4+12 for handhelds but they might not consider adding a whole new tile configuration packaging line worth it over just giving the OEM a discount.,Negative

Intel,"> Not great, not terrible.

Intel,"> BSPD and transistor density is flattening the VF curve on the high-end   He doesn't make this claim. BSPD in particular was supposed to help the most at high voltage, and the density does not appear to meaningfully differ from N3, which it still regresses relative to.    Best case scenario, the node, for other reasons, can't hit as high voltages as N3, and the top of the curve is just capped. But you wouldn't expect thermals to be such an issue then.    Doesn't seem to be any evidence of the core-level VF curve benefiting from the node either.",Neutral
Intel,"Jaykihn attributes only density to the supposed heat issues, not BSPD. Which makes sense because the process guy and Stephen Robinson both talked about having to space out the signal and power wires when working with BSPD.  If they prioritized density, then it is possible that frequency could not reach the theoretical maximum due to crosstalk or heat issues.",Neutral
Intel,"18A has always been low density, but expected to compensate for it with very efficient frequency scaling past peak perf/W. It was always going to struggle in laptops, where you rarely push past the best perf/W due to thermal and battery constraints.  Wait for the desktop/server chips before you call it. With fewer thermal constraints and much higher power budgets, they should be able to push well past the perf/W peak, where it should continue to scale well and for a long time before it starts hitting severely diminishing returns.  I'm not talking 300W monster CPUs, but the scaling between a 65W and 105W 18A CPU should be more significant than on current nodes, where you might gain like 10-15% additional performance from that 50% power bump. I'd expect 65W to 105W on 18A to yield 20-25% due to the benefits of BPD.",Neutral

Intel,"I actually suspect otherwise - speculation on my part, but I suspect that they were running into unexpected process issues when they pumped the frequency and/or voltage higher so they had to scale back performance.  It almost feels like a process bug that they discovered when making the actual chips.  They've also talked about kind of weak yields on 18A on their latest earnings call.  That makes me optimistic about the improvement opportunity in a more mature 18A if they can chase down these issues, and perhaps even more in 18AP if they can clean up these bugs.  If they have a 'double upgrade' opportunity in both fixing the discovered 18A issues and implementing the originally planned 18AP improvements then it could end up being a somewhat bigger jump.  Don't think it'll be an N2 beater though.  18AP *might* beat the best of N3 in some applications, we'll see.  For that you'd want to look ahead to 14A where the CFO mentioned on the earnings call (and he was somewhat realistic in other areas so it's more believable here) that 14A has been a positive surprise and they're actually pretty excited about it.  It's possible that if Intel gets more experience on High-NA versus TSMC that they might start having an edge later on.  Maybe.",Neutral
Intel,"> Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD   And yet we see the exact opposite here.

Intel,"Yeah after being reminded that the LPE cores are also Darkmont like the E-Cores I looked up the layout in detail and the differences is simply the P and E cores are on a large Cluster with L3 Cache and a fast ring-bus, but the LPE cores are seperated from that Ring-bus and don't have any L3 Cache (just access to a ""memory side-cache"" accessible by the NPU and small cluster but not the large cluster).     They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them.

That only suddenly changed by 2017–2019, when Intel suddenly increased core-count in mobile swiftly from Quad- to Hexa- and ultimately Octa-cores, while pushing the TDP in quick succession  into insane territory.  *That was the time, Asus took about a year to manage applying liquid-metal en masse, for Intel-notebooks!*  You are right with your sample here, yet you only confirm what I said before. Only past quad-cores it was.",Neutral
Intel,"> The idea is that because LP-E cores are off ring, you can power gate the rest of the cores when you're doing light tasks, getting much better battery life.  Do you happen to know, if that (ring-bus related) was the same principle on MTL?  > The failure of MTL/ARL's LP-E cores was that there was only 2 and they were very weak, so in practice, even a single web page would turn the ring back on and move the process back to the main cores, **negating the entire point of them**.  Yeah, talking about throwing some completely untested sh!t onto the market, irregardless of the fact, if the product makes sense or not — A true classic, I'd say. Just Intel being Intel.  Since dropping those LPE-cores on MTL, would've actually made the mask and thus needed die-space *smaller*, which in turn would've actually *increased* their yields \*and\* in return profit-margins already …  But muh, benchmark bars and ""AMD has moar corez!!"", I guess.  > LNL/PTL/NVL have much more powerful LP-E cores, 4 of them instead of 2, so common tasks can stay entirely within the LP island, and they're on the same compute tile, so they're also used in full nT workloads.

In others words they want Panther Lake to ride on the momentum and positive vibes the B series branding has garnered.   Xe³ is a Xe³ based architecture like Xe³P is architecturally but there is more to selling a product than the engineering, keep in mind there's strong rumors that there will be a B770 launch, Intel also just released the B60 and later this year will provide a big software expansion to Bxx cards so the B series brand is still full of life. Xe³P will launch much later and at that point Intel feels there will have passed enough time to leave the B series branding behind.",Neutral

Intel,"They would be extremely stupid not to continue to release discrete graphics cards, even if they decide to release 2-3 gaming SKUs per new generation; entry/budget, mid-range, high-end, etc.  - they win. until they keep iterating up, maturing driver, increasing install user base, improving software, until the point they can target higher segments (enthusiast tier)  Gaming GPUs remain the flagship component that pushes the limits of silicon design, features like ray tracing, AI upscaling, and real time path racing all debut in gaming before trickling into pro and AI workloads. Every research report shows that demand for high-end GPUs is still strong. Steam HW survey shows the most popular GPUs are still mid-range gaming cards, showing that discrete GPUs remain central to the PC ecosystem.  And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",Neutral

Xe3 just have additional optimizations and HW blocks along the lines of OMM (confirmed) and whatever new tech Intel decides is worth pushing for higher end parts.

Intel,"> It explicitly calls BMG dGPU cards ""discrete"" and does not do so for PTL  Of course not, since it would instantly tank their reputation and will kill all further ARC-sales?!  Do you actually think, that Intel is that stupid to plain announce the death of ARC-series graphics-cards? Do you think they'd even sell a hundreds cards after such a announcement? Who would by a dead-end line of graphics-cards, which won't even get any further driver-support and still have disastrous drivers like Intel's ARC? NO-ONE!  Of course they virtue signal it through the backdoor here, to preserve the sell-off the of the rest of pile of shame of their B-series graphics-cards as long as possible (leaving users with none support afterwards), and *only then* pull the plug afterwards when they went through their inventory …  Since when are you following Intel? Intel has always done so, and only announced a sudden discontinuation once the inventory was sold (leaving customers in the open with no further support overnight), despite virtue signalling a continuation all the time (to preserve a proper sell-off).  ---- Wasn't this exactly the same story with **Optane** back then? Each and every question upon a future support was answered in the affirmative, only to pull the plug overnight again as usual …  I'm not another piracy of cons here, it's Intel pulling the same Optane-stunt with ARC – Happily selling off their cards, knowing darn well, that they will pull the plug, yet refuse to actually play with open cards again.",Negative

Intel,"You have to look at this from both sides.  This would give NVidia the ability to offer OEMs a tightly integrated on SOC gfx solution vs a separate discrete gfx package as it is now. This would lower costs for NVidia's customers as well as improve performance and Intel's cpu's get to ride that train.   Intel has a long track record of using integrated gfx so it's certainly right up their alley to take this on.  Could Xe gfx coexist with NVidia? Yep, I think so.  Xe could be the budget igfx option and iNVidia is the premium integrated solution. That's basically how it is now with Intel Arc/Battlemage & GTX.   On the DC side, Intel has absolutely no gfx solution at this time and won't have anything for at least two years.  Intel already sells NVidia when a gfx solutions are needed so tighter integrated products will benefit both sides in that DC space as well.",Positive
Intel,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work. And even if NVIDIA wants to keep Intel's fabs open, I doubt they want to run them either.",Neutral

Intel,The b580 is still good at $250 and it’s only recently in the past month the 5060 and 9060xt 8gb dropped near or at $250 in some instances.  It’s a good card at 1440p aswell and it has 12gb of the other 2 8gb cards.

Intel,"It's a really good general purpose card. Perhaps not the best card if you want to squeeze out the most fps out of games, but it performs really well in a wide range of tasks including gaming. And yes 12GB VRAM really comes in handy.  It can easily be found for under $250. B580 is still cheaper than 5060 and 9060 XT and even RTX 5050 and RX 7600, especially in the UK where you can find a B570 for only 20 pounds more than RTX 3050. That's way cheaper than RX 6600, it's a no brainer. But the prices could only go down thanks to economy of scale mostly. It's been produced for a while, that's why.  Also one of the big reasons it's still selling now is thanks to good publicity. Imagine if it came out as the same time as RX 9060 XT. HWU would tear a new hole regardless of how much of an improvement it is over the Alchemist cards and the impressive productivity performance.

Intel,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction. Very important when running 24-48 hour simulations.",Neutral

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm more familiar with the Linux side / vGPU than VDI.  ECC is Error Correcting RAM. I generally don't understand the use case for ECC either, but it is ubiquitous in HPC. All server boards support ECC RAM.  In modern environments most of these features need 16GB of VRAM minimum, but if you ever wanted to try it on a consumer card, you could get an old RTX 20 series and try it out with some driver mods.

Calculations, it absolutely depends on what you're calculating and which bit gets flipped; flipping the low-order bit in a number might not matter much and flipping the high-order bit could cause a big error.  Networking, it depends on whether the protocols you use have more error checks at a higher level (TCP does; UDP does not).

Obviously fixed pass though is an option, but even that isn't without issue. NVIDIA only recently removed the driver restriction, they could add it back at any time. Plus you are limited on virtual machine by the physical GPU count. It works with Intel GPUs and is FOSS with them.  SR-IOV on Intel fixes all of that. It works amazingly well with their iGPUs, has no license issues, and is fully FOSS.",Negative

Intel,"LMAO, I actually have quite a bit of knowledge in this area.  If all you care for is VDI for a small number of VMs, then you'd go GPU passthrough. vGPU / MxGPU often requires higher levels of hypervisor software tier (i.e. VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus), requiring more money. For KVM hosts, setting up vGPU is a lot more difficult and time consuming than just straight up GPU passthrough.  Only two groups of people would be interested in GPU virtualization / splitting:  * Enterprise, in which they wouldn't care about the used card prices.  * Enthusiasts, in which they wouldn't want to pay for vGPU prices anyway. So why bother catering to this crowd?",Neutral
Intel,"Full GPU passthrough is not a solution that many people would consider because it is clumsier than using sr-iov (or potentially VirtIO GPU Venus). Plus for each extra passthrough instance I would have to add in another GPU and this greatly increases power consumption, heat output and cooling requirements. The process is not all that much more complicated at least on Turing GPUs with a hacked driver on KVM guests at least. Plus for passthrough, you probably still need an NVIDIA card because last I checked AMD cards still had a random kernel panic issue after being passed through.  My assumption is that sr-iov on the b50 will allow users an affordable way to have multiple guests on one host GPU without increasing power draw and paying for expensive alternatives and expensive vGPU subscriptions.",Negative
Intel,"...first time I heard people prefer SRIOV over GPU passthrough because it's ""clumsier"" lol. I'm sure setting up mdev devices in KVM, finding the correct corresponding GPU instances, making them persistent through reboot, then edit virsh xml for each individual VM is a lot easier than just doing IOMMU passthrough. /s     Again, enthusiasts don't care about power consumption / heat output / cooling requirements for their lab environment. Enterprise that do care about them are very willing to pay extra cost to get a production ready driver. You're creating a hypothetical situation that simply does not exist in the real world.",Neutral
Intel,"It's good they launching this, this card adds some competition to the landscape, but before anyone buys it they should figure out if their drivers are lighter weight.

Intel,"The E core having more improvements than just 50% larger L2 is a nice surprise, but damn the efficiency and performance of it is insane. 29% and 22% more performance, at the same power draw is insane, clocking like 6.7% higher too. They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown. As that can probably handle like another extra watt of heat and performance. Battery life is very nice, the fact that it can match other phones with like over 1000mAh bigger battery is funny. As people always flexing over how they have like a 4000, 5000mAh+ battery, of course having a bigger capacity is better, but the fact that Apple is more efficient with it and can have the same battery life at a much smaller battery speaks volumes about it.",Positive
Intel,"The occupancy characteristics of A19 Pro are quite incredible. 67% occupancy for a RT workload.  Look at Chips and cheese's SER testing. 36-44% ray occupancy with SER in Cyberpunk 2077 RT Overdrive.     Assuming NVIDIA can get this working on 60 series an effective a 52-86% uplift. After OMM and SER this seems like the third ""low hanging"" RT fruit optimization. Anyone serious about a PT GPU architecture NEEDs dynamic caching like Apple. And no this is not RDNA 4's Dynamic VGPR, it's a much bigger deal. Register file directly in L1$ has unique benefits.",Neutral
Intel,"Nice been waiting for this. P-core frontend improvements and branch, and a wider E-core with it's newer memory subsystem shows great YoY gains as usual. Though I am not surprised since it's been years leading up to this that Apple has steadily have been increasing power/freq to get the rest of it's performance gains, although IPC YoY is still class leading. The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that. The base iPhone 17 looks like a reaaly reallly good option, more than ever, wished they didn't drop the Plus model. But man, I feel like waiting another year, hearing rumours about N2 and new packaging tech excites me.  That said, looking forward to QC, MT, and Samsung.

Intel,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.  Its either Qualcomm or Apple. AMD is too far behind Oryon and Apple's uarchs. They consume similar or even more area for their core architecture while lagging in performance while using significantly more power. The x86 ecosystem and compatibility is the only reason they'd survive Oryon.",Neutral
Intel,Having so many SoC makers on arm competing against each other by one upping each other yearly is bearing fruit vs x86. i don't know how Intel and AMD long term can fare at this rate. Arm CPUs are still showing double digit gains yearly.,Neutral
Intel,Most of apples RT gains are from optmsiing how the GPU deals with divergence.  This is not dedicated RT silicon so much as making the GPU be able to maintain much higher throughput when there is lots of divergence.  RT operations have a shit tone of divergence.,Negative
Intel,I can't wait to see die shots and measurements for these chips. The A18 Pro and A18 die shots were really interesting to see what was compacted or lost for the base model chip. I have a feeling that there will be bigger differences for the A19 Pro and A19 with that giant SLC on the former. Die areas will also be interesting. Cache isn't cheap for area and I'd also love to see inside the new E-cores and GPU.,Positive
Intel,">Growing the E core into a medium core is really important and something I was worried apple might miss out on, but this means they should be able to keep up in multicore as trends point to flooding CPUs with E cores.  I wouldn't say its a medium core yet tbh. Apple's E cores are still sub 1mm2 in area usage. Compared to other ""M cores"" they are still relatively small. I imagine the A19 Pro E core is fairly larger but the A18 E core was around 0.6/0.7mm2 in size. I'd imagine its not grown a whole lot.  >They really ~~buried~~ deleted the lede by not even mentioning the E core improvements beyond the cache and undersold the GPU.

GPUs are not designed for short running diverging workloads. But RT is exactly that.

So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",Neutral
Intel,"While RT does have lots of branching logic (and CPUs are much better at dealign with this) you also want to shader the result when a ray intercepts, and this is stuff GPUs are rather good at (if enough rays hit that martial)   We have had CPU RT for a long time and so long as you constrain the martial space a little GPUs these days, even with all the efficiency  loss are still better at it.   (there are still high end films that opt for final render on cpu as it gives them more flexibility in the shaders they use) but for a game were it is all about fudging it GPUs are orders of magnitude faster, you just have so much more fp compute throughput on the GPU even if it is running at 20% utilization that is still way faster than any cpu.",Positive
Intel,"Its not just useful for RT but also for a lot of other situations, being able to just call out to functions on the GPU and not pay a HUGE divergence penalty (you still pay some) opens up GPU compute to a load more cases were we currently might not bother.",Neutral
Intel,I'm a bit confused. You think lagging 15% behind in P/W the competition for an entire year is not being a generation behind?  ARM themselves have managed only a 15% jump this year.

Mediatek's and Qualcomm's which dominate the majority of the market lag even further behind.,Negative

That was Apple's choice to upgrade to this faster memory.    Now, you're very right: we can't purely blame the uArch at Apple. It may well be the DRAM or the boost algorithms (like we saw at the A18 Pro launch last year) and—at Apple specifically—even the marketing overlords.

Intel,"While the efficiency for this is BAD, I dont think its 20W per core.  When we look at results by [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-zen4-zen4c-scaling/2) we can see \~7-8W per core for this (not great numbers, because its a weird chip and different node), which is still very bad. AMD certainly has some power issues, but many of which, i.e. inefficient I/O dies, are not really dependent on the CPU uArch and could switch at any moment. They certainly have much more inefficient chips at the moment than both Apple and Qualcomm. For Zen 6 we expect a major update to the desktop chiplet architectur which could bring some much needed improvements in terms of I/O though.  They have reasonably fast cores, and I think they are not in a terrible position, even though it is far from good. I think what is interesting for AMD to look out for is that they keep moving fast, instead of intel who didnt move fast since like 14nm, and AMD has strong cores. Additionally AMD has (including from the datacenter) an enterprise need to make the CPUs more efficient.  So yeah, very bad CPUs efficiency wise. A bit behind, but not terribly on perf per node wise, efficiency on the desktop is an afterthought for AMD, clearly, but they are moving constantly and are improving.

So what will happen first is some data will be evicted from cache and those bits will be used as registers.   maybe that shader has a typical width of just 5 registers and only in some strange edge case goes all the way up to 30.

TSMC claimed 25-30% power savings from N7 to N5 and another 30-35% from N5 to N3.  Using these numbers, we get these 4 E-cores using somewhere around 6-7w PEAK, but this is all-core turbo. Intel's CPU at it's most efficient 12w configuration won't hit it's 4.4GHz turbo required to win in single-core performance and is going to hit closer to its 1.2GHz base clock in all-core sustained performance at which point the E-cores not only have their giant IPC advantage, but double the clockspeed too.

You will also use this mixed martial uber shader to use up all the dregs that do not fit within a SMD group.      Eg you might have 104 rays hit a martial but that martial shader can only fit 96 threads into a SIMD group so has 8 remaining thread, you don't want to just dispatch these on there own as that will have very poor occupancy (with 88 threads worth of compute ideal) so you instead inline them within a uber shader along with a load of other overflow.",Neutral

Intel,"Are you currently experiencing significant CPU bottlenecking or plan on upgrading the GPU in the near future? If the answer to both questions is no, upgrading everything but the GPU is not going to significantly improve gaming performance, and it's kind of a waste of money since your gaming performance will still be limited by the 3070.  Since you do plan on a future GPU upgrade and/or are CPU bottlenecked significantly currently, the upgrade makes more sense, but 3 years is a long time to wait on a gpu upgrade, especially if you're not currently CPU bound.",Negative

Intel,"It certainly does seem like you're CPU limited, at least for that game.   A cpu/mobo/ram upgrade wouldn't give you that much more performance, though, since the GPU is still at 93% usage, but it would likely improve 1% lows any any stuttering if you're experiencing it currently.",Neutral

My interests changed, my standards changed, the world changed. I don't regret getting a 1050 because that was all I could afford at that time, but I absolutely regretted not getting the 4GB variant.  Back to your question, if you're interested in older games and are concerned of B580 driver issues, get the 3060 12GB instead. It is quite a bit slower, but it can run just about anything, from ancient games like Mirror's Edge (where PhysX support really shows) all the way to newer VRAM-hungry titles like Cyberpunk and CK3 which will easily exceed 8GB VRAM even at just 1080p.",Negative

Intel,"Strictly price/performance, the RTX 2060 is the best value GPU. But there’s other important areas to consider.  Firstly, I wouldn’t bother with the radeon cards in your position. At this tier of GPU you’ll need the upscaling, and RDNA 1/2 are stuck on FSR 3. They also won’t be getting any new features from now on either.  I wouldn’t look at Intel cards either. They have improved, but still have some work to do regarding drivers.  So between your Nvidia options, I recommend the RTX 3060 12gb. It’s decently fast, has 12gb of VRAM, and has access to the best upscaler. It will also be supported longer than most of the cards here.",Neutral
Intel,"I’ve found gputiful super useful for comparing all those options. If you're looking for the best price/performance, check out their benchmarks for the 2060 vs the 6600 or 5700 XT   good luck!",Positive
Intel,"For price to performance, a used Rx 6600 is quite literally known for that. I’m not sure if it was this subreddit but if you search on google there was a Reddit post where someone made a chart of the best FPS per Dollar and in there the 6600 and 6650xt from the used market were one of the most efficient.",Neutral

Intel,"I can also recommend checking out how much a 7800x3d costs in your area, where I’m from the difference between it and the 9600X you’ve chosen is probably about 100 GBP if I convert it. It will provide quite higher FPS in cpu bound scenarios (which on a 1080p screen with a 9070xt isnt going to be uncommon), but once u upgrade to 1440p the difference isnt going to be as noticeable.

Intel,Thanks man,Positive
Intel,"Hey, don’t take my opinion as fact, I’m just a dude on the internet and its your money :D You should probably ask other people as well and do a bit of research yourself, but it really mainly comes down to the games you are going to be playing. If you are going to mainly be playing shooters, more esports focused games it could be well worth it to downgrade the gpu to a 9060 xt 16gb and get an x3d cpu. If you are going to be playing equal parts AAA single player games, equal parts multiplayer shooters, then in my opinion it’s probably not worth it. Like I said tho, just my thoughts   On another note 350 GBP is quite steep for a 7800x3d and is quite a bit more than what I can get it for (I’m in Europe, converted comes out to about 290 GBP). The 9600x is a mighty fine cpu tho, will do just fine",Neutral
Intel,Cheers man I will look into it,Positive
Intel,"I was looking at the 7 series, I can see a Ryzen 5 7600x3d for £280 would that be a better cpu for occasional games like arc raiders but predominantly competitive shooters like valorant etc",Neutral
Intel,Most places I can see talking about it say the X3D is superior for gaming at both 1080p and 1440p so may have to find a way to squeeze that in,Positive
Intel,"Yea the 7600x3d is quite similar to the 7800x3d its probably within 5-10% of it at most. Honestly you’ve balanced your build quite well in terms of price to performance, I can’t see anything immediately obvious that you can cut back on. Don’t get me wrong tho, the 9600X is also a damn fast cpu and will more than likely get you 300-400 fps in valorant, cs2 etc if you play at competitive settings",Positive
Intel,7800x3d   9800x3d if money isnt an issue,Neutral

Hence you’re golden.  What you meant to say is that you would really like to hit a locked 120fps, not 120Hz.

Intel,"Ahh. Tbh 5800x is a beast CPU. Unless you feel the need or want to upgrade or see CPU at 100% utilization, not sure if upgrading CPU will help you.",Neutral
Intel,"Same here, I experienced the same a couple gens ago.  I had upgraded my GPU from a 5700xt to a 6900xt, but I was still running my 3600 CPU.  I was initially upset with my performance gain with the 6900xt.  Then I upgraded to a 5800x3D, I felt that upgrade more than the GPU.  Not as bad, but I'm dealing with similar performance degradation on my 5080FE, mostly in 1% lows.  I upgraded over the summer, and it is performing well.  I can see my 5800x3D struggling on graphic intensive games though.  I'm currently waiting for a really good deal to change mobo, RAM, and go to a 9800x3D.  If not, I plan to wait for Zen 6 chips to release next year.",Negative
Intel,You’re right but I also use it for music production so I might notice the core / thread count drop.. might have to go with the 7800x3d $450 or the 9800x3d. $530. Still gonna need ram too. Thinking about it more i’m not sure it’s worth spending all this money,Negative

Intel,Yep.  I did the nvidia apps recommended settings which were pretty much max.,Neutral
Intel,"Not at all, I think I could get away with it a bit",Neutral
Intel,Yeah it just sometimes the TV is pretty big and can give me a headache. It’s especially good for single player controller games but sometimes I think when i’m playing a lot of mostly MNK games i’d benefit greatly from a smaller 32” 4k display and more than 120fps.,Negative
Intel,Maybe I should just get a monitor lol,Neutral
Intel,5800x is not a beast gaming cpu anymore. I was on a 5700x which is only like 2-5% slower and upgrading to a 7800x3d quite literally doubled my fps in BF6.,Negative
Intel,I think the 7800 would be the better idea over the 7600 if you dont wanna get the 9800,Neutral
Intel,Just get the 7600x3d  Realistically sounds like all you need is a 7600(x)/9600x though,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah you totally could, OCing is very safe these days. Stability is very much at risk but it's extremely difficult to brick your stuff. And aosy every chip has some headroom",Neutral
Intel,"I absolutely agree with you, tv is good for a laid back controller experience, but for mouse and keyboard games go with a smaller screen for sure",Positive
Intel,You will absolutely get a noticeable performance boost by going for any of the AM5 x3d chips. Only reason to really avoid upgrading imo would be if you can't find a ram kit that hasn't skyrocketed in price yet.,Positive
Intel,"Honestly, that's a solid choice with your freshly upgraded rig.",Positive
Intel,You play at 4k too?,Neutral
Intel,"I'd personally also go with a cheaper AM5 right now and then upgrade to a Zen 7 high-end CPU in 2028 or 2029. I think this way you're squeezing the most value out of your mobo + RAM platform long term , especially at the current RAM prices.",Neutral
Intel,I have to make sure I emphasize that my display is 4K but playing with DLSS balanced or performance which is 1080p internal res,Neutral
Intel,No but i have a 5060 which is half as fast as his 5070ti so he should see large gains unless he's actually maxed on the gpu utilization already which i doubt.,Neutral
Intel,"I understand. But upscaling still does require power, (I understand you just upgraded GPU, so GPU is not something you'd upgrade) so a stronger GPU COULD be beneficial as well.   As mentioned by another redditor, you really just take a look at your CPU and GPU utilization and then go from there to figure out what might be the best path forward FOR YOU. Because to go to AM5, on top of CPU cost, you'll need a new mobo and the now crazy priced RAM.",Neutral
Intel,"Considering he's using 4k120Hz monitor (I guess technically a TV, but a display nonetheless), and even with DLSS, that's a high bar. I don't know how CPU dependent arc raiders is, but I know BF6 REALLY is, and that's probably why you saw such a huge jump. If arc raiders is, then he may see it.  As I said, I wouldn't be so quick to determine that he'll get the same jump you did with CPU upgrade without knowing his utilization, which is exactly what  I communicated when I said OP should see if CPU is at 100% utilization.",Neutral
Intel,Didn't mean to imply OP would double his frames or even close to that. Was just pointing out that the 5800x isn't really a high end chip anymore and that upgrading it would make sense.,Neutral

Intel,Since you usually play balanced i'd deff say go for the cpu upgrade. You should gain 20+ frames and have significantly better 1% lows. What's the cost for a 7800x3d for you since you only mentioned 9800 & 7600 in the post?,Positive
Intel,Looks good to me. Provided pricing right and all that jazz. I'm a big believe in value-for-money.,Positive
Intel,"The NV3 often uses QLC flash, which has low durability and becomes noticeably slower after a few years. Get a better drive with TLC flash like the Kioxia Exceria Plus G3, WD Blue SN5000, TeamGroup G50, Patriot P400 Lite, or Klevv CRAS C910.",Neutral
Intel,"Thanks for including possible replacements, i'll look into it.",Positive
Intel,"I'm waiting on them to make something that can replace my 3070ti, the minimum performance I want for me to justify an upgrade would be a 9070xt / 5070ti  Intel, i'm waiting, and i'm willing, so show me what you can do.",Positive

Intel,"A770 Owner here. Was between 4060-7600XT-A770 this year, video games was a second focus but wanted to go more for productivity (in a budget). 4060 was fine, but the 8gb VRAM make me go for the other 2 options, mainly if I get to edit very big things in high res., it would be hard to do.  And between 7600XT and A770... The A770 gets 4070 performance on video edition, and Intel codes are far better than AMD. Gaming performance they are almost the same... So far very happy with my purchase.  Since the start of the year, doing the same workflow, with driver updates I got to shave a total of 5 minutes on each video render. At the start was 20m, rn is 15m with the same type of edition. And driver bugs? 0, enever needed to reinstall drivers.",Positive

Intel,Plex server,Neutral
Intel,"A770, really liked it for it's price point, even though it was a pain at first. Solid at 1440p.   I'll get the b780 if it ever releases.",Positive
Intel,I've got the A770 16 gig and it seems fine.  Hard to tell with games if it's my GPU or the game being next gen ready. I came from a gtx 970 so it felt like a massive upgrade. I remember Balder's gate being real low fps in act 1 on the 970 but very decent on the A770 at 1440. Hunt showdown also gets 90+ fps in busy areas but has had issues dropping to very choppy fps when things are happening close. With Hunt it's very hard to tell what the issue is as it has frequent issues that effect many gpus at the same time. Like a friend playing on amd had different issues at the same time as I did. Honestly couldn't tell you if I've turned the graphics up from low since I had that issue. A770 runs armored core 4 really well to the point that I haven't had to mess with any settings or check fps.,Positive

Intel,"I have an A770 in my rig, genuinely never had a problem unless it was Fallout 3",Positive
Intel,I had a B580 near launch. Was my replacement for a 1080ti at the time. It was totally fine for my use case. I did upgrade to a 4080 later but that was more due to my use case changing (built a sim racing rig with a large format 4k TV) than the performance of the card itself. I was also quite partial to the understated looks of the card,Positive
Intel,"Ive used plenty of Arcs and have enjoyed the performance and compatability.

Intel,"Got an Arc B580 for the price/performance ratio, coming from an RX 5700 XT. Was a good bit of an upgrade in a lot of newer games. Honestly think it's a great card for that purpose.  Unfortunately, I ran into poor performance that was a no-go for me. Yakuza Kiwami had a huge issue (ran at like 50-55 fps with horrible lows that made it jittery, while my 5700 XT easily pushed 144, which makes sense, it's basically a PS3 era engine with better assets). From what I can tell, 0, Kiwami 2, and YLAD all had the same issue, and they got fixed over the course of a few years. The problem with that is that 0 was reported on the forum like 2 years before it was fixed. I was in the middle of a playthrough and couldn't just wait for reasonable, playable performance. I even tried DXVK and got a big boost (like 90-100ish), but it was still very unstable.  So you really do have to beware of older games still, despite the drivers having improved a lot and being overall solid. Some other DX11 titles ran perfectly fine though.  OpenGL performance? Forget it. Necesse uses Java and OpenGL and I managed about 70fps before using Mesa for Windows to get a boost. Still wasn't ideal compared to my 5700 XT, once again (and AMD isn't known for OpenGL performance on Windows lmao).  So overall, I think it's a great piece of hardware with mostly solid drivers, but it's not good enough for me on the driver side and I don't want to wait. It lasted 2 weeks before I returned it and got a 9060 XT 16GB (which is again a good bit of an upgrade from the B580, so the extra cost doesn't hurt as bad. I've been waiting for so long for an upgrade that made sense to me).  This was all in the middle of last month. Got my 9060 XT on the 30th.  I'd also like to note that they did alleviate most of the CPU overhead issues recently, so my 5600G wasn't an issue in games that did run well, like The Finals (actually ran extremely well with maxed out settings, and XeSS is actually really good on the Arc cards).",Positive

Intel,Replaced my 5700xt with a b580.   Performance is equal or slightly better at 1440p ultrawide.  The 5700xt was running out of VRAM in some games though and I was having very frequent driver crashes too.  The b580 has actually been a smoother experience.

So the partnership allows Nvidia to, instead of selling a GPU chip to a motherboard OEM to be soldered, will now sell that chip to Intel to be integrated into the SoC package as a chiplet.

Intel,"No, I don't do a lot. The main goal wa to use it as a display GPU, but the AV1 encoding is a nice bonus. I run OBS in replay mode (10 minutes) in the background and this intel GPU is used for encoding.  I want my Nvidia GPU to not have any monitors connected to it, so I can switch between using it in my host OS and in the VM, here's an example of how it works: [https://youtu.be/3fiXFv85iRU](https://youtu.be/3fiXFv85iRU)  This allows me to for example stream a game directly from a VM to my TV and still use my PC to do something else, like for example few weeks ago we played Trine 2 with my brother, when I was running the game in both the VM and host (one copy on Nvidia and one on Intel) and we played multiplayer together.  I used to use the VM to play everything like year or two ago, but the Nvidia drivers on linux improved significantly, so nowadays I don't use it nearly as much, but I still do from time to time. Plus it's always nice to have a backup plan for running some anticheats.",Positive
Intel,"I'm using looking-glass. It's a bit different than parsec, it works by copying frames from the main GPU's framebuffer into the shared system memory segment and then to the 2nd GPU's memory. No compression and very low latency (I use virtual display in my Windows VM that I can set to 500Hz, which gives me around 2.5ms of added latency in total).  I also use Sunshine and Moonlight when straming to a TV or remotely to my laptop or phone. I have the cheapest server in OVH that I use as a VPN, so I can access my PC or share some services over internet (like my personal cloud for example: [https://cloud.yayuuu.pl/index.php/apps/memories/s/pKqfn86wLLy6xZM](https://cloud.yayuuu.pl/index.php/apps/memories/s/pKqfn86wLLy6xZM) ), so I can game from anywhere, just login over SSH to my home server, wake on lan PC, start a VM and connect using Moonlight).",Neutral
Intel,"Good point, I guess it isn't necessarily the best gaming CPU, but I quite like its speed for compiling etc.  Getting some 5xxx CPU seems like just a small step up and wouldn't be cheap. And anything even higher would mean basically replacing everything: Mainboard, RAM and CPU. Going with a lower core count and higher boosts might be better for gaming, but would feel like too much of a downgrade.  Ironically most games, which I play besides Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, are such old titles, that both GPU and CPU are complete overkill. And lately I found just far too little time for gaming in general to make it worth it with the current prices to get some DDR5.  Edit: I just checked and at least according to Wikipedia the Ryzen 5000 CPUs aren't clocked all that differently. Its successor the 5900X has a boost of 4,8GHz, but same core count and same L3 cache and same TDP.",Neutral

Intel,"Wait, if you don't connect your Nvidia to monitors, does that mean the thing you see on monitors is only rendered by the Arc?    So, is it like how you stream from game pass? Where you let other PC run and calculate the game (your VM in this case) and then stream the game on your host OS?    Are there advantages in doing this? How are the graphics compared to directly using your Nvidia?  When you say that you rarely play on the VM nowadays, do you mean your Nvidia is connected to the monitors? Or is there a way to split the task without VM?  Also when you played Trine 2, does that mean the game looks better on TV than your PC? Since Ark is weaker.  Sorry for asking many questions lol",Neutral
Intel,"😂 Just has less bandwidth, but still really damn good.",Positive
Intel,"It caps the bandwidth. But that's fine because it's not strong enough to even utilize the full bandwidth that 16 lanes would provide. And those extra lanes would just increase cost.   This *may* be a problem on an old motherboard, because 8 lanes of PCIe *may* be too little (idk, didn't see any tests). But 8 lanes of PCIe4 are more than sufficient.",Negative
Intel,"You need to change your expectations if that is your point.  If you buy a stick of RAM today, it is going to run at half speed if you don't go into the bios and correct it. If you don't want to tune your PC, don't build one yourself.",Neutral

Intel,"https://preview.redd.it/5utu2xxvee1g1.png?width=5240&format=png&auto=webp&s=a281c9815d6408496deeaa752ed61862de335754  No, I can choose which GPU I use for rendering. That's basically what laptops are doing this with multiple GPUs. I just set these environmental variables in the steam's launch parameters: DXVK\_FILTER\_DEVICE\_NAME=""NVIDIA"" \_\_NV\_PRIME\_RENDER\_OFFLOAD=1 \_\_GLX\_VENDOR\_LIBRARY\_NAME=nvidia   and it will run on Nvidia. I can do the same with any other app, like browser, blender, etc. The screenshot shows an example of the game running bare-metal on nvidia-gpu and being displayed on intel GPU.  To not repeat the same parameters with every game, I've made a simple bash script that just exports these variables (and few more, like DLSS upgrade, etc), so I just type ""setenv %command%"" in steam lauinch parameters and that's it.  When running a VM, I use looking-glass, which is different than streaming the game to another device over LAN (like in your example with gamepass). Looking-glass uses shared memory to copy frames from one device to another, so it only works within one PC, but the video is uncompressed and with minimal latency (like 2-3ms of added latency). This is essentially the same path as offloading rendering but with one additional limitation - windows forces vsync, so I need to run as high refresh rate inside windows as possible to reduce latency. I use Virtual display adapter that allows me to set up to 500Hz and run desktop without any physical monitors attached.",Neutral
Intel,"Trine 2 is not that demanding, both GPUs can run it at max settings just fine. This is also true with a lot of older games. With new games it wouldn't work like this, but there is another way. Linux has a built-in multiseat, that allows logging in 2 different users at the same time, giving them access to different monitors, input devices, etc. I could use a 4k dummy plug to enable multiseat on that device and stream from there to the TV, but I don't have it configured right now, as I still need VM sometimes, so usually it's enough.",Neutral
Intel,"So like a v6 Camaro? Not as fast at the suped up v8, but still better than a Corolla?",Neutral
Intel,"I think it’s less about “not getting the full performance”, and more about it being a fire hazard.   Especially when you pay that kind of money for it.    In fact, one could argue that the consumer shouldn’t be able to make your product into a fire hazard, even if they aggressively fuck around with software parameters. As long as no modifications were done to the hardware - it should be perfectly safe. Sure it may not function properly, but it shouldn’t melt itself.",Negative
Intel,"Your ram clocks actually depends on your other hardware, its not the case for gpu. Its fine that you like it, but other may not, and nothing on the box say i need to understand something about overcklocking\\downcklocking. Also i doubt that some random dude will spend time to play with your gpu settings if you buy prebuilt, you will just get it as it is.",Neutral
Intel,"More like the transmission than the engine. PCIe lanes determine how much compute (horsepower) can get to the CPU (Road) so if your GPU (Engine) is performing really well but is bottlenecked by PCIe lanes, you aren't really getting that level of performance.   It's also why this objection to the Intel cards is a bit of a moot point. If you are running a v6 than you don't need the best transmission, the car isn't making the power to necessitate more HP to the wheels.",Neutral

Intel,"I don’t mind tinkering(in fact I enjoy it a lot, both at my job as a software dev, and as a hobby).  However, hardware+firmware(when not modified) should not allow software to set unsafe parameters, period. And the fact that those unsafe parameters are set from the factory - is all the more insane.",Positive
Intel,Of all the differences between cards at that price range the number of PCIe lanes it has will be the last thing you'll notice.,Neutral
Intel,"A couple things stand out to me here:  - CPU not going above 60°C is strange, unless you’re running a very beefy water cooler. Did you try running something like Cinebench and compare the results to other 5700X?  - Are those 16gb of RAM a single stick or two? If two, are the in the correct slots (one free slot between the two)?  Intels gpu drivers are known to be quite heavy on the CPU, but I don’t think a 5700X should struggle that much.",Neutral
Intel,So  the cooler is not anything special like an assasin spirit evo 120 but I got 2 new coolers for the case because i was sure heating was the problem.But under load It researched 75c yesterday. but it runs cool thats what I was trying to say.I will fix that.  Dual slot and they are in the first and third slot.  My motherboard doesnt support PCIE4 and people told me that could be weird but from everything that i saw on videos and forums it shouldnt affect that much the fps.,Neutral
Intel,"The slow RAM is definitely dragging your CPU down a bit, but it shouldn't be that much of an issue. PCIe 3.0 should also be fine for that combo.  Have you tried running a CPU benchmark?",Neutral

Intel,Can you up your budget to $350?  9060xt 16gb is more powerful than wither of those options and vram should keep it relevant a long time.,Positive
Intel,"I think the b580 is the better buy. The 5060 has worse fps/dollar, and less vram",Negative
Intel,At a base it's around 20ish percent better but the extra vram in the b580 might help it last longer.  I'd go for the b580,Positive
Intel,"Intel Arc is still today for a  Tech Savy Enthussiast with alot of patience,   There is alot of probleme to be fix still.  The 5060 is your best bet if you want to game without have to troubleshoot every time. and the software stack (feature) is superior, Even if stability-wise the last year of NvidiaApp driver as been a hit and miss.  Radeon would be a choice but checking the current pricing for 9060 xt 8go variant. the saving dont make up for the nvidia advantage.  Specialy that in a close futur Nvidia Neural Texture compression is going to leave Beta and turning the VRAM argument to old history.

Intel,Never looked into AMD cards (only reason I looked at Intel was because I was bored in my hardware class) but I will take a look,Neutral
Intel,"The b580 is a decent budget card, but the 16gb vram of the amd make it an attractive option for the price point.",Positive
Intel,i4-14700 and Arc B580.. not saying any of those choices are wrong... but the i7 is a high end CPU paired with a budget GPU. i5-14600K and 9060XT could've been better but ok... and also the Arc B580 can't really play on 4K without HEAVY XeSS.,Negative
Intel,"It is a pretty questionable HTPC build tbh. You definitely should’ve allocated more money to the GPU.   14700 is a pricey chip, I’m sure the 14600k is cheaper and you easily could’ve power limited it in bios. Alternatively a 14400 would’ve been fine too.  As well I went ddr4 with my build and it was quite a bit cheaper.   Sf750 for this build is super overkill. It’s a great PSU, I have 2 of them, but they are very pricey.   Just the cost of fans you probably could’ve gotten a 9060xt as well.",Negative
Intel,"This is not a gaming PC, it’s a media centre PC. For gaming, I use an RTX 4070 Super. The 65 watt i7 was chosen because it’s a cool running CPU, averaging 30–32 degrees in this build. Also, to semi future proof it for if I ever do turn it into a gaming PC. The Arc B580 was chosen for it’s great through-hole design that helps with airflow, which is beneficial given this SFF PC’s restrictive layout. That said, I have another build with a ARC B580 that games at 1440p just fine, so this PC would still be perfectly capable for gaming.",Positive
Intel,"It’s pointless to invest more money into the GPU at this stage, given that this is a media centre PC and not a gaming rig. The 65 watt i7-14700 was chosen not only because it’s a cool-running CPU, averaging 30–32 degrees, but also to semi future-proof the system in case I decide to convert it into a gaming PC later on. If that happens, I’d be using a higher-end GPU and wouldn’t want to be limited by an i5. The Arc B580 was selected because it’s more than capable for my current needs and features a through-hole design that helps with airflow. As for the PSU, while a 750-watt PSU isn’t strictly necessary, it’s 2025 and with GPUs continuing to demand more power, I wouldn’t go any lower. With the way this build is set up, I’d only need to upgrade the GPU in a few years, and that’s only if I choose to turn it into a gaming PC. The fans, been using Noctua fans for many years and I wouldn’t touch anything else.",Neutral
Intel,Lol sorry mb. But you should mention that somewhere,Negative
Intel,What does media center pc mean in your context? For me my HTPC is being used like a gaming pc for my TV.   Also Intel is very good with idle power draw but make sure you’ve limited the boost wattage. For me I’ve limited my 14500 to 95w on short bursts. The 14700 should have a higher base boost power.,Neutral
Intel,"I mean just watching movies, listening to music, streaming and video encoding. No gaming.  I also have a 14500, a 14700K, and another 14700 in three other PCs. Those are gaming systems, and I’ve found that when set to Intel default settings, they average around 60–65 degrees during gaming without me needing to enforce power limits, since Intel default settings enforce them automatically.  Edit: 60–65 degrees for the non-K CPUs. My 14700K runs more like 70–75 degrees. Honestly, I much prefer the non-K 14700, since in my benchmarks it performed only 3–5% lower, yet ran cooler and used less power. Not like anyone overclocks these days anyway.",Neutral

RDNA1 and RDNA2 GPU's will continue to receive the same game ready style drivers as they always have.   It just means that if AMD develop anything new, like FSR4, it won't be made backward compatible with older cards.

I'm sure it's not just due to hardware limitations, since 6000 and 7000 share similar hardware necessary for upscaling. They can't throw that ""we drop support because compatibility blah blah"" card on consumers.  Well on a positive note, it's good that 6000 series will still get FSR4 support thru mods, although that might be limited, as some online games could trigger anticheats.",Negative
Intel,That just sounds like BS from AMD.   Why come out and say something you already said. What this sounds like is AMD trying to back peddle a decision that would cost them future sales. The best part is if they get this out there now. Then oops don't update for games moving forward. Then no one will say a word. It will be done and over with.   Everyone knew FSR4 and the like wasn't coming to RDNA1/2 gpu's they said this before. They don't back port new stuff anyway.

Take a guess where I was lol.   Nepo/crony hires are the worst because they are like the only ppl in the company that can get away with being totally inept.   This does not excuse AMD though since they are way past the point. I wonder if AI is being used to “streamline messaging” as sometimes it just words things wrong and if you don’t catch incorrect nuance or the unintended implications, things like this can happen.

Intel,"OK, 1080ti you aren't wrong. I still have one alive and well in a rig with an accellero 3 cooler conversion.

They believed it enough that they actually let some performance out of the bag and into the market... otherwise they would have released a crappier card on purpose, because that is legitimately what NVIDIA do without any real competition: hold back technology and dribble it out in ever crappier improvements year on year.  AI is cool, but apart from GPT doing my spreadsheets for me (which costs OpenAI far more than my subscription) , it's made every single product it's integrated in worse.  It's already at the point where a customer faced with the choice between AI assistant integrated VS vocally proclaiming no AI...they will pick the one without AI because it's just data harvesting guff.  It is a bubble. There will be no AGI. Customers are already tired of the lies, and companies aren't going to keep losing money to do my spreadsheets for me.",Neutral
Intel,Not gonna lie. AI is extremely useful. But the energy consumption is what is going to be the limiting factor. They need to focus on power efficiency if they want to prevent that burst but I bet they won’t.,Neutral
Intel,But they won't burn all their money for a bubble though,Neutral
Intel,"C'est peut être la traduction Reddit qui est inexacte mais je ne comprends pas ce que vous voulez dire par ""bulle IA"". Je veux dire, c'est clair maintenant que l'IA va perdurer et que les besoins ne vont faire que croître d'années en années.

No different than the Dot Com bubble or Mobile App bubble or social media bubble. Some companies like OpenAI or Google or Anthropic will ""win"", they'll buy up any startup/smaller company that actually shows promise (or potentially has promise and would deny competitors the engineers working there) then the market will calcify.

Intel,"Data Centers use a lot of power, and there's more demand for data centers than before, but this isn't a specific to AI problem. I've ran local LMs (Llama primarily) on my own server, they're not significantly harder or demanding to run than a typical server. Per the UPS I have attached to it, that single server uses around 200-400W the average is around 1700kW/h per year, and this is a fairly inefficient homelab.   Image/Video generation on the other hand, requires a lot more processing power, as anyone who's worked VFX will tell you, but this isn't the bulk of work that LLMs are doing. It's also why AI was able to ""pop up"" on every site so quickly, as it's really not significantly more intensive for Cloud providers than most K8S systems. This isn't a _pro_ AI comment btw, just noting that the power consumption aspect is a bit of misinformation that companies like OpenAI are _themselves_ pushing as if they make it seem too intensive to ""get in"" at this point, they solidify themselves as the defacto winner of the AI bubble. It's also why they recently have started bringing up ""ethical concerns"" about data theft and wanting regulation on data scraping...because they've already scraped everything.

Intel,"That's updating an existing feature, though, as the 3060 already supports DLSS4.  An actual *new* feature would be something like Nvidia enabling DLSS frame generation on the 30 series; something it doesn't currently officially support.  It seems like it's kinda splitting hairs, but that's what the whole AMD thing is/was about: People thinking that ""no new features"" means the same thing as ""no updates"".

You had ridiculous stuff pop up nearly everyday and get investment, and then in 2-3 years the investors (and the companies) realized they had no way to actually make money, so the bubble burst.  You can look up articles and videos on it by searching for ""Dot Com Bubble"", it's often discussed.

Intel,"yeah, that's true, 100% a big downside, if you happen to play games where that matters. i didn't even know fortnite had kernel level anticheat, because i'm lucky enough that all the games i play don't require that.  i think it's a market saturation thing. if a significant enough part of the user base switched (steam deck is helping a lot there), the developers would have to adjust their anticheat solutions eventually. since kernel level anticheat still doesn't effectively prevent cheating anyway, i think it's just a current trend that will eventually go away again.",Negative

Intel,editing/gaming: Intel  pure gaming: AMD,Neutral
Intel,245K is better but it seems that LGA 1851 socket is dead. They will switch to a new socket (LGA 1954) with the next gen. That means no upgrades without a new mobo.,Negative

Gaming oerofmemace they are mostly fine (they are only bad compared to the X3D).  I would suggest get more money for a 265K, but either way a 245K is pretty good. Of course, you could say there's no upgrade path... But just think about it: I how much time are you going to upgrade?  And even if you plan to, you could get a 285K in some years and that thing is one of the fastest CPU productivity wise rn.",Positive
Intel,"Considering the limited upgradability of that Intel gen, you might as well just get a 265k. And yes, Intel is better for your purposes.",Neutral
Intel,"Worth noting that LGA 1851 won’t be getting anymore CPUs, so if you plan on upgrading your CPU later, go for AM5. Also I know RAM prices are crazy right now, but please don’t get a single 8gb stick of 5600 CL40 RAM. 2x 16gb that’s has a speed of 6000 and CL30 or CL32 is much better.",Neutral
Intel,"Intel takes the lead in video editing, in my opinion.",Neutral
Intel,the 7600x and the 9600x are budget CPUs while the 245k is mid-range (that it's so down on its MSRP to compete with the 7600x and 9600x is another matter). i have no idea about video editing workloads but going by [pugetsystems.com/solutions/video-editing-workstations/adobe-premiere-pro/hardware-recommendations/](http://pugetsystems.com/solutions/video-editing-workstations/adobe-premiere-pro/hardware-recommendations/) i would go with AMD for an hybrid gaming & productivity workload since core ultra is horrendous for gaming but ryzen matches core ultra in the productivity benchmarks.,Neutral

They overclock very well and do get meaningful bumps in performance from faster RAM.  The extra cost compared to a 14600K will be meaningless after a year or two but the performance difference will be very noticeable.   Having spent most of my PC building/Gaming Life as an Intel fanboy, personally I think the x700K (what is now 265K for the Core Ultra) model of Intel CPUs always seemed to be the best bang for the buck performance vs cost vs longevity.",Positive
Intel,"If you want to go Intel, get the 265K. Its such a good upgrade from the 245K for under 100 bucks. Its around 280 dollars, competes with the 9700X in gaming and with the 9900X (400 dollar CPU) in productivity. Also supports higher RAM speeds if that is important for you.",Positive
Intel,"Hop on AM5 and dont look back, you have a far wider range of upgrade options than anything intel could offer right now. the 7600X is a good entry point for AM5 but there are far better offerings in the ryzen 7/9 range for your workload. once you get into ryzen 7 and beyond you dont need anything else for any workload.",Positive
Intel,That's so sad 😭,Negative
Intel,Good idea. I was gonna go with the montech air 903,Positive
Intel,"Doesn't really make sense to get 14th gen. A new 265k is cheaper than a new 14700k or 14900k and getting them used seems ill-advised to me (it also isn't even much cheaper than a new 265k anyways, so kind of a pointless risk).",Negative
Intel,"Ram is important, none of these seem to be bad choices, theres at least 2 intel CPUs I could pick and 2 AMD so it really comes down to if I want to go editing or gaming focused.",Positive
Intel,Understood 🫡 7700X it is.,Neutral
Intel,"Its subjective but I find the air 903 looks quite different irl from the advertised images make sure to check th builds in reviews to see if it fits your taste, the king 65 pro on the other hand has tinted glass   This build is with 245kf, no integrated graphics since you have a gpu https://pcpartpicker.com/list/sKts9C  This one with a 9600x https://pcpartpicker.com/list/4hz9b2  245kf is better for editing, 9600x is slighly better for gaming and like 12% slower for editing but the platform is upgradable",Neutral
Intel,"I guess you will have to find an equilibrium that provides the most performance between the 2. AMD officially supports 5600MHz RAM but it can be overclocked in the BIOS with EXPO and Intel supports 6400MHz and with 200S Boost it supports up to 8000MHz but the specific RAM kit matters.   If you go with AMD I do believe 6400MHz would be stable on their CPU's. Just research based on people who actually have systems with 6400MHz RAM kit with Ryzen 9000 CPU's. good luck also with the RAM prices, hopefully your budget is flexible with whats going on.",Neutral
Intel,"From what I've read, you still want the intel iGPU and its quick sync feature for video editing.",Neutral

Intel,"Digital art as in 2d Photoshop, Clip Studio Paint, Rebelle, Corel Painter, etc are almost completely CPU and memory bound. Even the 3d model poser in CSP is completely CPU. So I would recommend you max out CPU and invest in 64gb (or more) in ram before worrying about the GPU - it'll give her a much better experience in these programs.  But to answer your GPU question directly, I think investing in an Nvidia card would be good since a lot of 2d artists will eventually move into dabbling 3d work (Blender, Cubism, etc) and those thrive on Nvidia. I worked professionally doing 2d work with a 1660Super 6gb for years. So you could get a 5060 8gb, or a used 3060 12gb, and be completely fine (especially since you mentioned she doesn't game).",Neutral

Intel,I mean if the difference is more than 50$ and she doesn't need the 9060XT then get the A770,Neutral
Intel,Getting the B580,Neutral
Intel,It makes sense. A770 is technically a little faster I think but it was the first generation product and... well the focus is definitely on the B580 (and possible B770 yet to release) as far as driver development etc given it's the current gen product.

Intel,I have a great time playing it on my steam deck. I'm so grateful that it plays on it.,Positive
Intel,Seriously. It's so sad that so many games release with absolutely no intention of giving people the performance they paid for,Negative
Intel,They just stripped features out and used old settings. New features always pushes new tech holy why is everyone like this now. Can PC gaming not push further than what we have? Games scaled even worse back then when tech was doubling every year. If anything we are in a drought as tech is no longer having big gains as the best nvidia and amd can do is make bigger chips and pushing more wattage.   Its not just devs or engines its hardware manufacturers no longer able to keep up. Since every time pc gaming looks to stabilize we get a big boom and something spikes and those prices stay. As of now everything past 2020 is just price gouging that you paid for. Your money to performance is worse than ever before and you paid for it. You should be mad at nvidia with messing with their stacks. Then increasing the prices. Next gen is only to get worse.   The way I see it top end gpus have a harder time keeping up with what unreal 5 wants to do and since nvidia cuts the stack by 40% for the next tier down their is no gains on moving up unless you move up a tier. At the same time devs just dont have the time to optimize cause they dont have infinite money or time. But the better unreal 5 games dont run that bad.   We are so screwed.,Negative

Intel,imo the game loop got boring  I’m glad Helldivers 2 exists though. I hope they make a Helldivers 3 that’s even better. I’ll play it for sure.,Positive
Intel,"Somewhat, but the community has also been fairly willing to hear them out as they've made some recent commitments to fix things up and reducing file size for PC users. The game has been rock solid stable for me after a weird fix that support recommended though, so I'll pass it along:  Browse the local files on steam. Find the HD2 exe. Select its properties (not the usual properties that W11 wants, show more -> properties) and run it in Windows 8 compatibility mode. Also select the checkbox that runs it as administrator.  This does mean there's one popup thing that happens every time you launch it, but it solved all my crashing issues. The game might run really bad for a few minutes the first time you launch it after changing this, but it clears itself up.",Positive
Intel,"Performance issues are resolved now. Problem is because the devs decided to focus on performance and bug fixes, it's been under a content drought for about 3 months now so playercount is falling.  It was expected from the beginning that if they were to stop making content and focus on bug fixes, playercount would fall which was one of the reasons why AH held it off for so long.  They had to make a choice between maintaining the health of the game at the cost of low numbers for a while versus keep pumping content every month.",Negative
Intel,"Much more casual: no out of round health systems to manage, gear is much more plentiful and there’s less punishment for dying (you still lose your gear but it’s easier to craft) Free loadouts that aren’t on a timer like Tarkov And putting attachments on guns is idiot proof unlike tarkov",Positive
Intel,Definitely feels like a much more casual Tarkov. It scratches a similar itch and I have been able to groom my more casual friends into playing this game after Tarkov being too much.,Positive
Intel,"I really wasn't a fan of Tarkov. Arc Raiders, on the other hand, might be my GOTY. Way more accessible, looks better, performs better, and the community for the most part, is great. Solos is very chill, I reckon 95% of players are just doing quests or looting.",Positive
Intel,"Way more casual than Tarkov (or anything other extraction ahooter on the market, really). This is why it's so successful. People have been throwing around the term ""extraction shooter for the employed,"" lol.  The game is good fun and if you play solo too. Probably 70% of the people I run into are friendly. I will say that having a mic in this game improves your chances of survival massively.",Positive
Intel,"It’s like tarkov for fortnite players.   Theres only a handful of guns, losing your gear means nothing because you can get free loadouts at any time, most loot is just for crafting or tasks etc.   I like it a lot but it felt a little shallow having come from tarkov, but it’s definitely way more palatable to the average gamer.   Tarkov requires constant focus whereas i can just chill out and goof off in arc",Neutral

Intel,I have been watching a bunch of streams for it lately. Taking up more time than I'd like tbh. Really hope my wife gets it for me for Christmas lol.,Positive
Intel,"HUNT has a very brutal competitive streak, ARC banks on less PvP and encourages a more cooperative gameplay loop.",Neutral
Intel,"Hunt are Tarkov are the only ones that have done in right in that time. It’s not really a new thing, a ton of them have released and failed.  Difference is that Arc is actually doing it well, in a way that’s approachable to more casual players. So it’s blowing up.",Negative
Intel,I have about 20h in hunt but I wasn't a fan of being 1 tapped. At least in Arc you have a chance to fight back. There is no weapon that can 1 tap you.,Negative
Intel,"In a way, sure.  It’s also not Helldivers at all",Neutral
Intel,"They are both shooters, it stops about there",Neutral
Intel,"My only hesitation is the PVP, getting smoked at extraction because somebody wants your loot would get tiring fast.",Neutral
Intel,"In terms of third person, the way PvE works, and the fact that helldivers is also extraction-based, yes. The gameplay and movement is really similar. The addition of PvP makes it quite different however, as well as the absence of airstrikes lol",Neutral
Intel,"Third person, have to extract to be successful, you shoot big ass baddies... could be comparable, yes. LOL",Neutral
Intel,Did you finish your expedition project?,Neutral
Intel,"I was thinking the same, but since the price was accessible, feels like Arc Raiders is a evolution of the formula.  People said the same for turn based games, and Expedition 33 happened.

Intel,Does it support only deck or works on all distros?,Neutral
Intel,Yeah it’s still a really solid game. They also do a great job with cosmetics and treating the community well,Positive
Intel,"Borderlands 4 runs like dogshit even with optimised settings. It still drops below 100fps with DLSS performance at 4k. Arc Raiders I get 140-170fps on the highest settings. Borderlands 4 doesn’t even look impressive either. I don’t care how they’ve achieved the performance, it’s just a much better experience.",Negative
Intel,"I have 200 hours in Helldivers 2, at a certain point, I just lost interest because it took too long to find super credits to unlock the other warbonds, especially when you have people who run around the map doing their own thing and don't open the two-man locked gates.",Negative
Intel,"I was so into helldivers for the first few months, then I got bored and waited forever for the illuminate to be brought in, and that content turned out to be so incredibly underwhelming that I haven't touched the game since, such a pity because HD2 really felt special and refreshing for those first months.  At least the first game is still awesome and fun.",Neutral
Intel,"I'll try that compatibility fix next time I play. Beyond the lockups, my game was running quite well. Not sure why folks are downvoting you, but Reddit do be that way sometimes.",Neutral
Intel,"Its been a bit more than 3 months. We've basically had illuminate (4 enemies), cities, bug reskins and a few bots with reused weapons. In 2 years.   They've never exactly been pumping out anything but warbonds and store items, which are also mostly reskins of things we already have and effectively a subscription more expensive than paying for an MMO subscription if you want literally any new equipment, with something like 2 exceptions this year.  Performance is very much not fixed either, its better, but still awful on many tiles and hardlocks are still occurring for many among other long term bugs which remain untouched a year later.  Oh and they joked about lying to the community, then lied to the community, multiple times. I don't understand having faith in devs that literally try to deceive their customers, repeatedly.",Negative
Intel,"Fuck it, bought it",Negative

Intel,"Lmao so do I buy or not smh  Edit - everyone says to go on the Internet and look for myself, have you ever heard of asking somebody for their opinion?  I know a lot of you may not know this, but the information on the Internet even from some of your favorite influencers is very curated or paid for.  The interaction between me and the individual above is a real interaction in his real opinion  Always remember this, when somebody asks you for their opinion.  It’s not because they can’t do the search, it’s because they want an authentic opinion knowing that the Internet is littered with bullshit marketing.",Neutral
Intel,"It really doesn't. They both have a very similar gameplay loop, but Helldivers 2 is PvE exclusively with *far* lower stakes. And also HD2 doesn't use AI voices, for all its other technical flaws.",Negative
Intel,"While I won’t say it doesn’t happen, PvP is a super inefficient way to progress in Arc Raiders. The gameplay far more heavily encourages cooperation between players as opposed to competition, especially when it comes to downing the big Arc",Negative
Intel,I hit 100 hours last night and this has only happened a dozen or so times. Just go next and forget about it. There are ways to mitigate it too. Griefers have not slowed me down in any meaningful capacity.  Don't trust anyone with the stupid orange and black skin,Negative

Intel,"No, that's the one thing I can do. If I go back, that's probably what I'll focus on, that and blueprints, and parts for those high end recipes.  It's just a bit sad when money means nothing anymore when it was a big draw.  I think the game progression is balanced around PvP, and as fun as it is to find a ton of high end loot, the new map has too much of it and not enough PvP. It's too easy to get 40-50k of loot and dip playing solo. No one shoots, or at least it's easy enough to spot and avoid players.",Negative
Intel,"""I'd play soccer, but I don't care for getting scored on by griefers""",Negative
Intel,Something a griefer would say,Neutral
Intel,"You misunderstand.  Similar to BR, this trend has caused a lot of devs to waste time on making extraction games or extraction modes for non-extraction games that just end up being a waste of time and money. Look at Battlefield 2042’s attempt at extraction, it ended up being a complete waste of resources.  Plus the complete lack of PvE extraction games is odd. I want to like the genre, but it ***ALWAYS*** just ends up being unemployed players who no-life the game and have best in slot gear stomping new players. I just wanna play the PvE aspect of it. People act like PvE can’t be challenging which is just ignorant.",Negative
Intel,EAC does have issues tbf,Neutral
Intel,It should work on any distro. It works on my vanilla arch installation (btw).,Positive
Intel,"It's still at a class of it's own, but I do agree that all the current updates they're adding is underwhelming. I don't mind more warbonds, but it got to a point where they nerfed the super credit drops and it took too long to unlock anything anymore.",Negative
Intel,"If that doesn't work, it can also be the anticheat. The tools folder includes an uninstaller and reinstaller for it, which should reset that back to defaults as well.",Neutral

Intel,I would be surprised if you regretted your purchase.,Neutral
Intel,It's really good.  PvP is there but you can do a pretty good of avoiding it but the constant threat of it is what makes the game excel.  The Bots are really good and well balanced.

Intel,There is no pve only servers,Neutral
Intel,I'm near the end of that actually. It moves really quick.,Neutral
Intel,You're supposed to use the lvl 3 refiner and condense a stash full of tier 4 weapons and other top gear. Crafting 1 maxed out weapon by itself uses a lot of stash slots worth of materials just by itself.,Neutral

Intel,why dont you play other games then?,Neutral
Intel,The devs said they tried the pve only and said themselves that it was boring,Neutral
Intel,"If you’re looking for a PvE extraction shooter, check out Sulfur. It also has a lot of roguelike elements to it. It’s still in early access, but there’s tons of content there already and it’s very fun",Positive
Intel,"I didn’t misunderstand. The issue you have with extraction shooters is the PvP. That’s why I said there’s plenty of games with just PvE out there for you. I understand there are some shitty extraction shooters out there and a lot of them have been a flash in the pan but to say it’s a “shame” that ARC Raiders is successful is just a dog shit opinion. So many people are having fun and enjoying the game. Even if it isn’t around in a year, people still had fun with a $40 game. Is that really so shameful? You mention BF Firestorm but who cares if AAA studios try and fail. They need a wake up call anyway.   To your final point about about no lifers getting the best gear and stomping all the players with less playtime, I agree this is an issue in some extraction shooters and no developer has cracked the code to remedy that issue. However, if devs stop making these games like you suggest, the code will never be cracked. So again, saying ARC Raiders’ success is a shame is just ridiculous. Also, if you did an iota of research on the game, you’d know it’s easily the most casual friendly extraction shooter out there.",Negative
Intel,"If you think the extraction shooter genre is oversaturated, name at least 5 notable ones besides ARC and Tarkov.  Battle royale on the other hand IS (or was) oversaturated, as even AAA developers tried their hand at it.",Negative
Intel,"Do you know about escape from duckov, Helldivers or Incursion red river? That's probably more your style",Neutral
Intel,"Ah. My bad, i thought it only works on deck,  seems like it supports linux in general, pretty happy to know",Positive
Intel,"Yeah problem is I don’t like the game enough to play solo. So now I just run free kits only. This way when they lose a shield, ammo and grenades it’s a net negative for them if I die. Even better if I kill them.   Prefer ABI and tarkov.",Negative
Intel,"Did You know that marketing always puts their best product forward, that’s why you ask people for their opinions on it because they purchased a product and they’ve experienced it.  If I go online what do I see, a bunch of pre-created marketing material trying to sell me a product. The person above is giving me his honest opinion, something you can’t just find unless you ask for it on the Internet.  So while you claim I’m lazy as fuck, I see you lack critical thinking in perspective and trying to understand why people ask questions and other people for their opinion opinions.  I can tell you’re very easy to sell too, and you’ll probably eat up all the marketing material. So I have at fam spend your money away but don’t criticize people that are looking for opinions from not marketing sources.  Let me guess you think politicians care about you too?",Neutral
Intel,"There is prox chat and it gets pretty well used in my experience. On solos, with cross play off, I’ve found that things go really smooth around other players the vast majority of the time. Very rarely have I had to PvP.",Positive
Intel,Can’t craft tier 4 weapons if you find no fucking weapon blueprints,Negative
Intel,Ah ok. Thank you. I'll work on that then. Cash value was fun but it's not everything,Positive
Intel,That’s a failure on the devs’ part. Tons of compelling PvE games exist and have existed even before multiplayer games existed.,Negative

Intel,It’d be boring as pve and would not be popular at all,Negative
Intel,"you dont like the genre, so dont play it? i dont like puzzle games, i dont play puzzle games. pretty simple.",Negative
Intel,You say that’s not the only issue you have but I addressed every point you made except for your last line about people claiming PvE can’t be challenging. I’ve literally never seen anyone say that as it makes no sense. Every game was PvE before PvP was even a thing. So you can’t say I am still misunderstanding.   Funny that you chose that response and then didn’t address any of the points I made.,Negative
Intel,How exactly do you leave the map? Next you're gonna tell me you don't shoot.,Negative
Intel,"Again, only because the devs failed at their jobs. Tons of great PvE games exist. And since it’s PvEvP, they really have no excuse for the PvE parts to not be good.",Negative
Intel,If that’s what you wanna tell yourself. You’re not worth arguing with.,Negative
Intel,"That’s not what makes an extraction shooter an extraction shooter. By that logic Titanfall, Warframe, and Deep Rock Galactic are also extraction shooters.  Extraction is all about dropping in, gathering loot, and attempting to escape with that loot. If you fail, you lose that loot and all loot you brought in with you. None of that is true in Helldivers. Sure there’s samples, but you’re not collecting weapons or armor and you don’t lose any weapons or armor you bring in.  Helldivers is a mission-based co-op horde shooter. It’s not an extraction game.",Neutral
Intel,Helldivers seems like the only PvE game that had success lately. What other games are there?,Neutral
Intel,Well then yes. To stay logical consistent I'm fine with calling those extraction shooters.  Now what about the other 2 games I mentioned?,Neutral
Intel,"Then you’re either ignorant or just too stubborn to admit you’re wrong. Because no, none of those games are extraction shooters.",Negative

Intel,"There will already be branching inside the code of the driver. This has been the case already, to various degrees, for years. It's not new.  It's just whether AMD wants to formally spread those branches out on a file / compilation level and distribute different packages. And then publicly whether they commit to updating all branches of code or only some.  For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch. Of course, we have very little outside insight into the exact spread of these cases that AMD wants to pay their engineers to work on.",Neutral

It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.

Intel,"Appreciate you reaching out with this - that's an interesting data point to consider.  In this case, the quirky behaviour with HDMI 2.1 + FRL was attributed to a change made in the display stack, I don't think it explicitly involves display stream compression to repro, just high enough display bandwidth (though I could be mistaken)",Positive

Intel,"It has nothing to do with the lack of vulkan support, even when fsr4 comes to vulkan, the game still needs ray regeneration implementation from the devs, you cant use optiscaler through dlss inputs, like you probably will be able to in fx alan wake 2",Negative
Intel,I suppose is going to be fixed as soon as Amd Redstone go out. Basically is going to add every tecnology that Path tracing needs to work. Off course the devs would have to implement them in the game too,Neutral
Intel,"The issue is if you try to use path tracing. Which to be fair, you probably shouldn't unless the miracle of them getting Virtuous to implement Ray Regeneration in Cyberpunk happens.",Negative

Intel,Hmm fair. For me on 9070XT if I had raytracing enabled it would crash most regularly on loading back to the menu after extraction which was annoying but at least not game destroying lol. But yeah annoying enough that I turned RT off entirely.   I hope this means I can turn it back on because the game runs well enough for it.,Negative
Intel,"My last two processors are ryzen amd, my last three video cards are amd radeon and next one will be amd also, nvidia has driver issues as well, to be honest.

Intel,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.  More people use HDMI than what people think and those TVs don’t always have a DP connector at all.,Negative

Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind this only actually matters if one protocol or the other is **actually** limiting bandwidth for the [resolution * FPS] you want to display on your monitor  For instance, DP 1.4 can do ~25Gbits/s, which translates to roughly 1440p @ 240fps, or 4k @ 120fps  If you have proper cable into HDMI 2.1, it should be able to do ~42Gbits/s, which would instead be 4k @ 190fps  Read up the wikipedia tables for bandwidth specs and resolution / fps / bit depth rates for more",Neutral

Intel,"but i dont know something is also wrong with 25.11.1 ... AMD Adrenalin randomly vanishes from tray     i dont want to roll back to 25.9.1 :-(    but this version was the last which was good so far      maybe when we have luck amd is able to provide next time a ""perfect"" driver without any issues?",Negative
Intel,"Could be it, nothing hardware wise at all and just software too.     Yeah, you're not the 1st I've read that says they have issues on the game.     If you're crashing and the system reboots it does make me think of some stability issues and not really just GPU, but I'm guessing you've already tried stability tests and using the system without OC+A-XMP/EXPO disabled.     Once upon a time I remember reading some people, on other instances and other games, having crashes like that (complete reboot) due to PSU instability as well.     Good luck!",Neutral
Intel,That's strange. My game defaulted to everything maxed out including running ray tracing and I haven't noticed any issues. The game runs incredibly well.  I've got a 5800X3D & 9070XT as well.,Positive
Intel,"Fair enough, and yeah sooner the better for all of us",Positive
Intel,It absolutely could be.  Europe has some pretty good consumer law and promising features that could impact your purchase decision are part of this law.  It can fall under misleading advertisement,Neutral
Intel,"It's not freezing, it's just that the GPU usage is practically at 100% all the time, even with V-Sync enabled. With the 25.9 drivers, this doesn't happen, and the clock speed varies normally, increasing and decreasing as needed when V-Sync is enabled. These 25.10 drivers are causing the GPU to consume more energy unnecessarily.",Neutral
Intel,Fingers crossed,Neutral
Intel,"Allright ty, will Install new, any differences in performance?",Neutral
Intel,"im running 25.11.1 on win10 7900xt. no problems besides afmf2 breaking the performance overlay, which ive had for multiple updates now",Neutral
Intel,I don't think you understand what I mean.. If you downgrade to that you can get fsr 4 to work on 6000 series without having to change any files.,Neutral
Intel,Thank you for this. This was very helpful. Got adrenaline working fine now.,Positive
Intel,"I wish my LG C4 42"" had a display port. Its my primary monitor.",Neutral
Intel,"Yep, AMD is not so quick in fixing their driver download page, I still can remember when X870E chipset came out but you found only X670 option. The drivers were the same, but man it’s your flagship chipset! Anyway, drivers install but Adrenalin App does not work for me… and have zero time to reinstall Windows.",Negative
Intel,"I feel like AMD can do a bit of a better job communicating this, despite Vik's great efforts in this subreddit. Just saying: hey guys, we know about this, it sucks, bear with us please can make things better in the long run in my opinion.",Neutral
Intel,"We've not observed anything like this internally, and I've personally not seen this at all in the field. This one may be specific to your display combination. I'll talk to a colleague in our display team about what we can do to learn more about that behaviour on your side - we might ask you to capture a special kind of log file during a state when your secondary display is blanking with gameplay on the primary",Neutral
Intel,Can you tell us what content you have on the secondary panel when it starts misbehaving? Is this behaviour affected if you disable VRR on it too?,Neutral
Intel,"I see. I recall the partial display freeze being related to DWM & multi plane overlay in Windows. One of our community testers encountered this and remedied with the overlayminFPS DWORD here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/1kgp7ar/cause_and_solution_to_windows_24h2_related/?sort=new  If you're getting TDRs, with chome(ium) + gameplay, pass us over a kernel memory dmp and we'll take a look into it",Neutral
Intel,"Oh yeah I noticed that too when watching it, kinda funny of him to say it as it's on screen",Positive

Intel,Didn't really paid attention to it :( but at least my game doesn't crash anymore!!,Negative
Intel,"did you download the same filename with the one i mentioned? i tried downloading windows 11 link and it also gave me the same filename, lol",Neutral
Intel,No you can't.,Neutral
Intel,"I don' think you understand either, 25.9.1 is that driver, 23.9.1 was released in 2023 before FSR 4 was even a thing.",Negative
Intel,"Glad I could help, the crashes on Arc Raiders were pissing me off big style so I wanted to share what helped me.",Positive
Intel,"They are TV's, not pc monitors. Buy the right tool for the job",Neutral
Intel,"I couldn't find the DWM key so I made one, we'll see if that fixes it. Thank you for replying. But please, forward it to someone. There must be people out there on AMD hardware that are not tech savvy and this just breeds bad reputation.",Neutral
Intel,"Nope, that didn't fix it. Chrome continues to forget to update its display. And WoW continues to crash in the background leading to massive stutters when panning the camera around quickly, along with plenty of other odd behaviours.",Negative
Intel,"Yeah, I'm facing the same issue on RX 9060 XT   Is it a GPU driver issue, or a Windows issue that Microsoft needs to fix?",Negative
Intel,"That's not how it works. Small print won't save you from stuff like this, you think that they can stop releasing this software for 2-3 years because some small print said 'Subject to change'?   European consumer law would absolutely support the consumer in this case. If you promise a feature by a certain date, you will need to deliver it. If the development takes way too long, you are in for a ride",Negative
Intel,What about 25.11.1?,Neutral
Intel,Yeah same for me. Considering how similair win10 and 11 are under the hood i just went with it. Still absolutely no problems sofar.,Positive

Intel,Did you reboot after setting that key? Is the display with chrome still only partially updating?,Neutral
Intel,"Haha. Sure thing buddy. If that would be the case, that a small print on a roadmap can't save a company, we would have hundreds of lawsuits in EU. You must be new to the hardware scene.",Negative
Intel,thank you,Positive
Intel,"Uh huh, yeah I did it too. You still have the overwrite DLLs. Hence the flipping tutorial. Completely irrelevant to this topic, anyways.",Negative
Intel,"Not a typo, I was asking about something else and he missed my point...",Negative
Intel,"Yes, it can't.   They could add that they can sell your organs, doesn't make it legal though.   Also lawsuits usually don't happen because of a feature or if they happen, in a very small amount that isn't meaningful. Class action also doesn't exist in Europe, so obviously you won't hear about it like in the USA.",Negative
Intel,"But flipping the dlls could get you banned from online games , that's why i was wondering if it's finally fixed in this update and we wouldn't have to flip the dlls anymore..",Negative
Intel,"You literally claimed we could do this without overwriting any files, that was obviously false.  Anyway, no. I would not expect AMD to bring FSR4 to RDNA3 anytime soon, if at all.",Negative

Intel,absolute cinema,Neutral
Intel,"That is not ""SLI"".  That is Crossfire.  There is a major difference.  ""SLI"" only permits alternating frame rendering (AFR).  Crossfire permits splitting a single frame load among different cards in addition to AFR.",Neutral
Intel,"Brawndo has electrolytes, that's what plants crave!",Neutral
Intel,"You have always been able to do something like this! Though cross manufacturer has not had ""benefits"" until Vulkan in some spaces for games, now lossless scaling, but for anything requiring VRAM or software level rendering, it's been there as an option.   Unironically, ""SLI and crossfire"" I'd argue, is back, but not in the traditional sense.  I did this with a 6950XT and a 2080ti, simply because I wasn't able to jump on the 3090/4090 train in time tho.",Neutral
Intel,"Works in Windows too. But Windows has way too much overhead for all of the AI garbage, ads and integrated spyware running in the background to still be a usable operating system. Linux is much better.   The drivers install all side-by-side, and all GPUs show up as OpenCL devices. In the software you can then select which one to run on.   FluidX3D can select multiple OpenCL devices at once, each holding only one part of the simulation box in its VRAM. So VRAM of the GPUs is pooled together, with communication happening over PCIe.",Neutral
Intel,"Windows has a section where you can select a gpu to run certain applications. It was introduced in win 10, but i only know the location in win 11    I think you can get to it through settings -> display -> graphics",Neutral
Intel,"What kind of application are you trying to run on specific GPUs? IIRC Vulkan will let you specify what device to use, even if it's not the GPU whose monitor is showing the application. DirectX I think is controlled by the Graphics settings in Control Panel. I think there's a page somewhere that lets you pick the GPU. That might be a Windows 11 thing though. OpenGL is the one that AFAIK will only render via the device whose monitor is displaying the application.",Neutral

I'm happy to have all major GPU vendor's hardware available for OpenCL development and testing. Quite often there is very specific issues with code running in one particular driver - compilers optimize differently, and sometimes there is even driver bugs that need workarounds. Extensive testing is key to ensure the software works everywhere out-of-the-box.",Negative
Intel,"Had that since 2018 - got it for free through Nvidia academic hardware grant program. It has slower memory clocks, but double (384-bit) memory bus. It's actually the strongest of the three GPUs.",Neutral

Intel,"They work well together - all GPUs show up as OpenCL devices. Need specifically Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTE though, as all drivers need specific ranges of Linux kernel versions and kernel 6.11 happens to work with them all.",Neutral
Intel,"Technically FluidX3D uses neither SLI nor Crossfire, but cross-vendor multi-GPU instead, for domain decomposition of a Cartesian grid simulation box, to hold larger fluid simulations in the pooled VRAM.   The rendering is done multi-GPU too, as domain decomposition rendering. Each GPU knows only a part of the whole fluid simulation box in VRAM and can't see the others. It only renders its own domain, at 3D offset, to its own frame with accompanying z-buffer, and copies those to CPU over PCIe. The CPU then overlays the frames.",Neutral

Intel,That's awesome!,Positive
Intel,"Yes, but SLI is a bad description for it.",Negative
Intel,"The faster PCIe 4.0/5.0 and future iterations mean that dedicated SLI/Crossfire bridges are obsolete. The PCIe bandwidth nowadays is more than enough. And PCIe is the generic industry standard interface, easier to program for than proprietary hardware that's different for every vendor.   For games multi-GPU is gone for good (too few users, too large cost of development, no return of investment for game Studios). But in simulation/HPC/AI software multi-GPU is very common as it allows to go beyond the VRAM capacity of a single large GPU for cheaper.",Neutral
Intel,"sli/crossfire were killed for good reason, its just a bad time all around if half of your gpu's core/cache is located a foot away from the other half, unless your baseline performance is so damn low that the microstutters just get lost in the noise.  ultimately chiplet cpu/gpu designs are basically just an evolved form of sli/crossfire, and we're happily starting to get quite good at those.  (assuming we're talking about games)",Negative
Intel,"indeed it did, if only game devs adopted this more. Then again, the idea of two high end GPUs like we have today in a single PC is kinda horrifying.",Negative
Intel,"There is not really a clear limit. More PCIe bandwidth makes scaling efficiency better, less means the software will run a bit slower in multi-GPU mode. 3.0 x4 (~3.3GB/s) is just enough for reasonable efficiency.",Neutral

Intel,"Indeed, people forget that the speeds electricity travels is slow in the computer world.   Kinda why the RAM slot closer to your CPU performs so good. And why benchmarkers will use that slot, and not the one furthest from the CPU.  Same with NVME m2 SSD, the closest slot is the best one. PC will perform the best if OS is located on the closest one.   Much better off just slapping two GPUs together in a single form factor than two separate GPUs.  Guess that is why we have 5090 these days. At about double the price of the old flagships.    You can view that as SLI i guess :P",Neutral
Intel,"Iirc Rise and Shadow of the Tomb Raider were the only games to support the used of mixed multi GPU (at least mainstream) other than ashes.

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative
Intel,One thing I appreciate about AMD is having the lowest CPU overhead for their graphics drivers. Makes a difference if you're CPU limited in a game.,Neutral
Intel,So Nvidia now has the lowest driver overhead? Seems like they took the HUB video seriously,Neutral
Intel,So the money you save on a GPU you will need to spend on a better CPU??  Might as well get a faster GPU.,Negative
Intel,Interesting that B580 doesn't look bad at all with a 13600k. I wonder what it's like with a 13400 or 12600k. It seems like just having those extra threads provided by the e-cores takes care of the overhead it needs.,Positive
Intel,"Unless you're running a CPU that's *many* many years old, GPU overhead is not really something you need to worry about. Whether AMD has less overhead or Nvidia has less, it really doesn't matter.",Neutral

Intel,"According to the graphs, AMD has slightly less overhead than NVIDIA.",Neutral
Intel,"No, they do not.  The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software.  They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  The main example that seems to suggest otherwise is actually a demonstration of nVidia's forced threading of DX11 games, which can increase performance despite the increased overhead it entails, when the CPU has enough headroom overall (i.e. it doesn't eat into the single-thread performance).",Negative
Intel,"Lowest with DX11 and older, but not with the newer APIs",Neutral
Intel,And when is the last time HUB did a dedicated video showing the improvement in overhead?,Neutral
Intel,or it's just a cache/memory access issue,Neutral
Intel,"The overhead is minimal for both AMD GPUs and NVIDIA GPUs, which is probably why reviewers didn't look at the overhead until Intel GPUs came along.",Neutral
Intel,"> Unless you're running a CPU that's many many years old, GPU overhead is not really something you need to worry about.   That's just not true with Battlemage.  CPUs released in 2024 showed the issue in testing.    It's not year of release, it's capabilities.",Negative

I think this will be great for non-gaming purposes, like Adobe, Autodesk and so on. 890M should be a photo editing powerhouse.",Positive
Intel,"I mean current consoles are already APU power houses, they can give you 120fps depending on the game, and 30-60fps depending on what mode you select. And these consoles are pretty power constrained and pared down compared to PCs. So this APU here could easily double the performance of a console.   That's tapping on 4070/7800 levels of performance.",Neutral
Intel,Never gonna happen as long as they use DDR memory.  The only powerful APUs are those that use GDDR or HBM. See: every AMD-powered console and the MI300A.,Neutral
Intel,"Radeon iGPUs are mostly limited by the shared RAM bandwidth. I was thinking of getting an 8700G a little while ago, and the benchmarks varied wildly depending on RAM frequency and overclocks.  Maybe they'll improve it by hooking it up to a wider GDDR bus in laptops, similar to how the current PS5 and Xboxes work (IIRC?)",Neutral
Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks. Intel is already moving on it and I think the main thing holding AMD back is that they rely on 3rd parties for memory packaging so the capacity goes to the more lucrative enterprise chips first.",Neutral
Intel,"The iGPU uplift is extremely underwhelming, I guess this is why Asus did the ROG Ally X model instead of waiting for these chips. I wouldnt be surprised if Lunar Lake with Xe2 passes Zen 5's iGPU at lower power levels, at higher ones im sure RNDA 3.5 will be ahead.",Negative

Intel,"It'll need to be a custom tooled APU like Aerith/Van Gogh if it is to take full advantage of the 890m.     Nearly all of the configs that release of 16cu Point APU or 40cu Halo will be an APU slapped in a chassis without an adequate power or memory bandwidth setup for the igpu.     What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra. Its desktop tower chip is behind the entry level mobile OS chip from its competitor. It is a decade behind the desktop chips of its competitor, itis hardly Monster class.",Neutral

And AMD ""can make"" such APUs -> PS5 Pro (as a more cost effective solution). AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative
Intel,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",Negative

If Intel can be competitive in the budget market it will at least put a fire under amd to lower their prices/make a better valued product.",Negative
Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't.

Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral
Intel,"This was a graphics card, not a ‘GPU’ in terms that we understand them now, just to bolster the point about how much of a disparity this comparison reveals.",Neutral
Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so?

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Intel,"And I'm over here struggling to keep an Nvidia T4 passthrough to work reliably on Hyper-V to Ubuntu 22.04. :(  Is there a specific software combination that works more reliably than others?   Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.

Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.  You're free to guess what vendor om looking at to replace my CPU with. Damn shame really.",Negative

We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line.

I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.  Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical. I guess that's why nobody is already doing it.",Neutral

All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

Intel,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

Intel,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point.

After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.

Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.  I think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable. There need to be a proper high-grade (and low grade) reliable way to avoid that.  Just sucks it took this long, and so much effort to get AMD to pay notice to the issue at hand here. To people that didn't get what the main issue was, hopefully my explanation helps.",Negative

In Linux - *in some cases, but it very common* - you get more VRAM usage on Nvidia compare to AMD because this how Vulkan driver implemented in Nvidia and overhead of DXVK.  P.S. For context - Unity VRAM usage is - Unity allocating ""how much it want"" and in case of two different GPU Unity may allocate less or more in DX-API, or DX-API have some internal behavior for Unity case on Nvidia so it allocating less.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.     From global issues with CPU OC was only one i mentioned. When AMD integrated Ryzen Master, old GPU OC presets did reset CPU OC values to default. To fix that you just needed re-set GPU OC and resave preset after update.",Negative

Intel,"Use Radeon Image Sharpening at 50% in the game's Radeon Settings profile when running native. FSR2 has its own sharpening pass. Many TAA implementations are blurry as fuck, which gives the illusion of better image quality when upscaling.",Negative
Intel,Okay fair enough! To me any upscaling has always looked worse than native in the games I've played and I've left it off.  Though it has undoubtedly gotten better recently - to my eyes it's never looked **better** than native resolution.,Negative
Intel,"I've used both FSR (2160p desktop) and DLSS (1080p laptop) and the loss in quality is noticeable to me. Always a softer image with less detail - yes, even DLSS. Performance always has a cost. Temporal upscaling is no different. DLAA and FSRAA actually are better than native, since they replace terrible TAA implementations and render at native.  However, this better than native upscaling narrative seems more like a belief (or a marketing push/tactic) than reality.   - If action is high enough, it probably won't matter much, but in single-player games where I like to look around, I just can't deal with the resolution loss. I'd rather turn RT off, as I did in Control (for AMD and Nvidia HW), which actually has decent RT effects.",Negative

Intel,> Enthusiast   > 1440p [...] with FSR Quality [...] 60 FPS  1440p + xxxx Quality upscaling is just another way to say 1080p you cowards. It's 2023 and enthusiast level is 1080p @ 60 FPS.

Intel,60fps with balanced upscaling on a 4080/7900xtx … That’s not a good sign,Negative

Intel,"Really disliking this trend of all new games having ""with FSR/DLSS"" in their PC requirements tables.

So sick of the awful PC ports and such. 6800xt is still a very powerful card yet I'm seeing more and more games require it for 1440p 60fps high or even 1080p 60 fps high. Ridiculous.  The reliance on upscaling tech instead of properly optimizing the game is becoming a problem. And it seems this game has forced RT which is idiotic. RT destroys performance and should always be an option.",Negative
Intel,"If you notice, all the mentioned AMD GPUs are significantly better than Nvidia GPUs, so does that mean bad performance for AMD GPUs?",Negative

Intel,so I'm doomed to use FSR even at 1080p ? what a shame pc gaming has become.,Negative
Intel,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?  (I'm not talking about this game in particular, just in general, it was same outrage w/ AW2 and that turned out better than expected)",Neutral
Intel,I hope they will bundle this game with CPUs/GPUs,Positive
Intel,holy hell so for 1080p you need a 1440p card because not even a RX 7600 is on par with a 3060ti or a 6700XT,Negative

Intel,"Another garbage with forced upscaling at baseline. When upscaling winded up - everyone was ""Hell yeah, high refresh rate AAA gaming""  Fast forward to today: ""FSR performance just to hit 1080p 60fps - yay..""   I fucking knew it.. it was so obvious upscaling will turn into this and replace game optimizations. Why optimizing shit, when you can tell people to turn on fucking FSR / DLSS / XeSS performance??   What a fucking shitshow... And few weeks back when I said I'm not gonna buy AMD GPU again because upscaling is getting mandatory and DLSS is just objectively superior - I was laughed in the face. Every major AAA game onwards will be shoving up upscaling as base line performance - so your typical 60fps marks (and 30fps - yes apparently that is still a thing on PC in 2023).

Also, displaying system requirements with upscaling is a bad joke. This is basically saying you’re not getting native 1080p 60fps without a 6800xt or 3080.

Intel,Hoping with my 7800x3d and 7900xtx fsr 3 4k maxed is around 120fps for my tv refresh rate. To be honest at my age I barely notice the quality difference of any input lag.,Neutral
Intel,They recommend upscaling even at 1080p.. disgusting ew,Negative
Intel,pretty much this we all knew they would start using upscaling as a crutch.,Negative
Intel,Welcome to modern times and how you can’t just brute force everything anymore. Or you can go buy a 4090 and not complain about how expensive that is.,Negative
Intel,"Yeah, I'm not crazy about using upscaling techniques on everything to gauge it's performance and requirements. I think more time needs spent on optimization but I could be ignorant for stating that.",Negative
Intel,My thoughts too…,Neutral
Intel,Thanks to all of you that were screaming dlss looks better than native lmao.,Positive
Intel,"I tend to be much more picky than those around me. A group of people I play with were all playing Remnant 2, and I FSR was driving me crazy, they all have way less powerful computers than I do, and none of them cared at all FSR was on. In fact they were impressed with how well it ran and how it looked. I think there is a general 80% of the PC population that doesn't mess with graphic settings and just wants the game to play. I'm a min/maxer when it comes to graphics where I constantly tweak it until I get the perfect output for me.     I'd love to have real data from games like this on how many people actively change graphic settings.",Neutral
Intel,and a year ago i kept saying this here and i got downvoted to hell   its so obvious that the game engine devs and game companies pressured both nvidia and amd for this because they can release games faster and somewhat unoptimised,Negative
Intel,"Upscaling, once a promising and beneficial tech, now abused by almost every dev cause they are lazy to optimize. :(",Negative
Intel,Nope we as a community abused a nice thing,Positive
Intel,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",Neutral
Intel,Didn't take them long to make upscaling worthless.,Negative
Intel,i smell a burgeoning cottage industry of game spec reviewers!,Neutral
Intel,"I've hated upscaling since the beginning.   Now, it's being proven right in our faces that companies are no longer making 100% they're making 45% done games, and then they rely on upscaling and fake frames to do the rest.   Why have a fully optimized game that runs well natively when you can just lower the resolution by 3x then have frame generation help?   Full force ahead to frame generation= Every game will be optimized so badly that you're forced to upscale",Negative
Intel,"It’s literally right there in the hardware specs. 1080p fsr2 quality is 720p input resolution, so at native the game runs at 720p low on a 1070 or 5700.  It is the inverse of what reviewers have been doing with their benchmarks - if you are a fan who really has a stick up their ass about native res, just do the math yourself. They’ve given you all the pieces you need to calculate it out yourself, but that’s not how the game is supposed to be run so they aren’t going to put native res in the official marketing material.  Games are optimized around upscaling now and it is unhelpful and misleading to pretend otherwise. Rendering 4x as many pixels is *obviously* going to throw things off with more intensive effects, and lead to a generally unplayable experience.",Neutral
Intel,"Judging by how games work on 4090/7900 xtx, these cards turn from 4k 60 fps to 1080p 60 fps",Neutral
Intel,requirements have been a joke for over 20 years at this point i dont know why people are surprised.   on the other hand crappy devs using fancy upscaling and fake frames to get the game playable instead of just making a well made game is infuriating,Negative
Intel,yeah this is the new standard,Neutral
Intel,"RT is the future. With this game and Alan Wake 2 using software RT at all times and hardware RT for anything beyond ""low"", RT is the future.  At some point GPUs will be so powerful and game engines will have RT in the bag that RT will be used in basically all indie games...and then suddenly nobody will talk about RT anymore because RT is in everything for years.",Positive
Intel,and with fsr now standard on consoles it(or a similar tech) will be standard on pc :(,Neutral
Intel,"people also forget both AMD and nvidia didn't really offer a generation leap in GPU performance this gen, sure it's popular to call games ""unoptimized"" (I know many AAA releases are, not denying that) but the issue compounds with the fact that game devs couldn't predict a GPU generation to be this bad caused by inflated crypro-boom margins a generation prior",Negative
Intel,"As with almost every game release recently, expect the game to perform a bit better than the requirements.    Sometimes the hardware can achieve 60 FPS most of the time but drops below that in other times, so the devs just say it's guaranteed 30 FPS and call it a day. If you look at the 5700 vs 6700XT, the gap is almost 50% in most titles, this means that if the numbers for the 5700 were accurate then the 6700XT will be getting around 45 FPS at 1080p low (unless the game utilizes special hardware only available on the 6700XT) but the game targets 60 FPS at 1080p high on the 6700XT which leads me to believe the 5700 is gonna perform much better which should leave room for turning off upscaling.",Positive
Intel,"It does state ray tracing in the top right, we don't know if that's included in the requirements or not. I would definitely reserve judgment until we find out.",Neutral
Intel,Don't forget about Frame Gen too. IMO that's the worst part because that means it's 30 fps without it. Imagine the input latency...,Negative
Intel,The actual true crime here is even having fsr to begin with. It should just have dlss,Negative
Intel,Seems like they tried to cover every basis with these.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah it's kinda weird, even games that had a massive difference of performance when using dual channel RAM never listed it on their requirements :/",Negative
Intel,"I've noticed that many developers do this, for some reason developers seem to have some kind of secret passion for the 1070 lol",Positive
Intel,It's because the minimum settings is with software RT enabled and thus they're using the fastest cards without hardware RT that can reach 1080p30 FSR2.,Neutral
Intel,"GCN support is over, RDNA1 is the lowest currently supported arch.",Neutral
Intel,"In 2023, RX 5700 performs equally or better than the RTX 2060 Super/2070. The 5600XT is more like a 2060 competitor.   Either the game runs like shit on AMD hardware, or the system requirements are wrong and they just write down the components that they tested with.   Another thing is that the game is doing is software based RT by default and that might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.",Negative
Intel,"They're not, those are the cheapest/slowest GPUs that have 8 GB of VRAM. Clearly game devs are done pandering to people who bought Nvidia's e-waste.",Negative
Intel,What do you mean forced raytracing?,Neutral
Intel,1440 + upscaling looks better than 1080p because you're on a 1440 resolution monitor.   Do you even 1440p?,Positive
Intel,"Honestly RT has a lot of fluff and the majority of which is the most costly for the least amount of noticeable fidelity increase. Try path tracing in Cyberpunk with reduced rays & bounces and you'll still get great soft lighting and GI without most of the performance hit when full tilt. If games only leverage certain aspects of RT then the performance is still comparable, that's also why the 3080 and 6800XT perform similarly in Fortnite with full RT/nanite/lumen settings.",Neutral
Intel,It's actually 960p :(,Neutral
Intel,"can advertize pushing all the triangles and RT if you dont stick with a low resolution, certain things launched WAY before they should have in the consumer space.",Neutral

Intel,Seems pretty good to me given it is at 4K with RT,Positive
Intel,"Likely includes the RT features , its also 4k",Neutral
Intel,"Its ubishit, what do u expect, however, since the game has RT reflections, shadows and GI, then i would say this is based on AMD shit RT performance, so lets wait and see how the 4080 is gonna perform.",Negative
Intel,"I wouldn’t mind so much if it was exclusively a 4K thing, but now devs are leaning on upscaling *at 1080p*, where it still objectively looks like ass and blurs everything in the background.",Negative

Intel,">Really disliking this trend of all new games having ""with FSR/DLSS"" in their PC requirements tables. T  its not much different for consoles , like alan wake 2 uses Low to mid settings and FSR balanced on PS5 even on switch titles use scaling and no man sky even FSR and stuff.",Negative
Intel,"I agree with this, that’s not that outrageous if this does include RT. Non RT would be pretty bad to need fsr but that is the quality mode.",Neutral
Intel,This is going to be the exact same situation as with Alan Wake. The game is going to come out and the requirements are going to make sense. People just aren't used to seeing games with mandatory rt.,Neutral
Intel,I would say pressured bc they announced it over a year ago and promised we will get it in september. Thats the problem with games an tech they all make promises and then cant keep the deadline. Just make smth new and when it works then announce it and make the last fine adjustments. If you make promises to early you set yourself up for failure.,Negative
Intel,"Maybe on the lower end, but for enthusiast and ultra... no, they're not ""significantly"" better. These are pretty on-par comparisons (outside of RT).",Negative
Intel,"How so? The 4080 and 7900xtx are neck in neck, same as the 6800 and 3080.",Neutral
Intel,"It's 4k, it will take another 5-8 years to be mainstream.  1440p slowly creeping to 10% marketshare give it another 2-3 years to be mainstream",Neutral
Intel,"Consoles use fsr as well, and not just fsr but often at low precision making the upscale rougher. Its an industry wide trend.",Neutral
Intel,">what a shame pc gaming has become.

Intel,"> what a shame pc gaming has become  I mean, PC gaming is in the best state ever. So many amazing games that run so well. Just don't buy all these shitty games, not like there is a shortage.  Tbh this game looks like standard movie cash grab shite anyway. Solid 4/10 game I bet.",Negative
Intel,Which means if all games will require upscaling it will force AMD to improve there's. I'm on board with you though will see way less optimization going forward which is not what we want.,Negative

Intel,"Mirage is PS4 game, Avatar is PS5",Neutral
Intel,"Update: I must've read that wrongly somewhere! Apparently, it uses their own Snowdrop Engine 😳  Well AC: Mirage is nowhere near a next-gen game. Avatars of Pandora, on the other hand, uses Unreal Engine 5 with hardware ray tracing. So it's only natural it needs more horse power. But it'll look 10x better than AC: Mirage. So there's that 😉",Negative
Intel,Timed epic exclusivity? Aww man.,Neutral
Intel,Was guaranteed to happen when up scaling was announced... It's an excuse for less optimisation or to push fidelity more.  I saw a video of this avatar game it got an insane amount of plants visible at all times.,Negative
Intel,You... are.. joking... right..?,Neutral
Intel,Because it’s not coming to steam. It’ll be an epic games exclusive so everyone will pass on it until it hits steam in 18 months. At which point no one will buy an 18 month old game for full price and will wait for a 50% off sale at the minimum.,Negative
Intel,Kind of a messed up opinion.  Maybe games don't look much better than PS4 on your PC but they sure as hell do on mine and that would still be true at a lower resolution and framerate.,Negative

Intel,We don't know the settings.  If its like cyberpunk psycho rt on release which 3080 and 3090 easily needed dlss balanced or performance for on 1440p and 4k...    Then I can see the same case in this game for 4080 and similar cards  Also they dont speak about frame gen just fsr2 ( which doesn't exist here because they support fsr3 which does up scaling and frame gen it's not split like dlss 2 & 3),Neutral

Intel,yup that is why I will play 1440 UW native with a 7900XTX.,Neutral
Intel,I guess they are confused with dlss.  Dlss 2= up scaling Dlss3 = frame gen  So they thought its for fsr3 too. ( as in fsr2 up scaling and 3 frame gen)   But fsr3 can do frame gen or not.  Fsr3 is up scaling and frame gen.,Neutral

Intel,Yea I know nothing about optimizations and if it could or couldn't fix this or that. I just want them to tell me exactly what I need to run the game at X resolution a Y preset with 60 fps. If that calls for a 14900k and a 4090 then just say so.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, I think we're really beginning to see a trend here with abusing upscaling for free mileage.  Not that upscaling isn't great but...  Apart from RT, on medium settings, I can't really see    massive improvements on visual quality that would warrant such a massive increase on requirements.  UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  We'll probably see this continuing to be a trend for a while, and then as tech novelty wears out, some devs will come out with more optimized and scalable titles.  With hardware prices being as they are, and with 60fps now being highly requested in consoles as well, it's pretty much a given.",Negative
Intel,"People accepted upscaling with open arms, so now devs know they can rely on people using it. Thus they don't have to care about optimizing for native res anymore. Oh you have a 4k card? Okay well we'll make sure it can run the game at 1080p so you can upscale it.",Neutral
Intel,"No average consumer wanted to come to this point. The market leader started pushing upscaling instead of just making stronger GPU’s and there’s nothing AMD can do to win them, only join them.",Negative
Intel,Turns out TAA is worse than AI TAA with AI upscaling.   Of course devs are gonna use it to cover their own asses. And they get perf boost!  Let's face it. The FUTURE is AI everything. Nobody is gonna talk shit about frame generation and upscaling when it looks perfect each frame.,Negative

The game companies can't just implement one gpu company's tech and not the others bc then it'll only work on the one gpu that you implemented the tech for and it won't work on the other gpus from other companies.

Intel,They have really long way to go. Take for example Lords of the Fallen - UE5's TSR is better than FSR. Take Alan Wake 2 and you get ton of shimmering on the edges. It's also not like nvidia not improving - so while AMD makes a step forward so will do nvidia..   There's also question how much they improve without dedicated accelerators that both Intel and nvidia is using. Intel jumped late to the party and they're already ahead - which just shows how much AMD cares. It's rally embarrassing considering both XBOX and PlayStation are also relying on FSR - ant that's bigger market than what nvidia has.,Neutral

Intel,Consoles are the baseline in most multiplat games and they've been using upscaling since forever. The real reason is just that we don't have GPUs anymore that are 10x faster than consoles like last gen. You can't bruteforce high resolutions in games that run at like 720p on consoles with GPUs that are only 2-3x faster.  If upscaling didn't exist on PC the minimum here would just be 720p at the minimum and 1080p-1440p at the max.,Negative
Intel,Next-gen doesn't mean that current gen can run it well. It means it's so far ahead that most curren-gen hardware can't run it properly + top-end hardware can only barely run it well.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly. These paid exclusive games launches only make me care less whenever they actually release.  It's not just Epic, Meta has done it with several games (Moss Book 2) and when a proper looking pcvr port comes a year later it sells bad because people forgot about it.",Negative
Intel,"Is that with significant RT? I assumed it was ""normal"" ultra settings.  Still I can play Far Cry 6 and RE4 with AMD sponsored RT at 4k native with 100fps. This game will have to look amazing to justify what... a quarter of that performance?",Positive
Intel,"You are correct. I overlooked the part where, under Ultra settings, it said that was with FSR2. Now it doesn't seem as bad. I mean, it's still not good because it's rendering somewhere between 1080p and 1440p, but at least it's not 30 fps without Frame Gen/60 fps with it like I thought.",Neutral
Intel,"It might be, AFAIK neither Nvidia nor AMD still support their implementation of it in their drivers.  But I've tried it on a few games and it is pretty cool to me, much stronger than almost any modern 3D movie (IMO why 3D has gone into hibernation), and I gather that Cameron designed the franchise around 3D.  Plus the Avatar 1 game was in 3D.  FWIW.",Positive
Intel,This is what I am thinking too.,Neutral
Intel,"You say that, but they specifically mentioned FSR3, and just DLSS, so i have a feeling DLSS3 will have to go via a mod again.",Neutral
Intel,"i have a believe that even 4C8T will survive for the decade, like the case of that 4790K. But turns out these newer UE5 games are wrecking even newish CPU like the 3600. i mean cmon it's still a 4 years CPU old which i think it's not old yet",Neutral
Intel,Let's hope so. 30fps is far from recommended for FSR 3,Neutral
Intel,Yeah I heard it works with that hoping it works with fsr3 now,Positive
Intel,"I've noticed that for some reason newer games look blurry at 1080 even without any kind of upscaling and I'm not sure why, older game look much sharper at 1080p",Negative
Intel,"Just lazy optimisation, that’s pretty much a PS5 equivalent GPU and you can be damn sure that the console version won’t be 1080P 30fps with FSR",Negative
Intel,"No it says 5700. NOT 5700XT, and yes there is a difference. Quite literally the difference between a 1070 and 1080ti. Or a 2070 and 2080.",Neutral
Intel,no no my 7 year old card needs to be able to play at high settings. so does my low end card from today. gotta be high or its just bad,Negative
Intel,Crazy expectation? A game released in 2023 should be able to run at 1080p low 30fps on a low end card like rx6500xt (lowest end modern card you can buy now).  Optimization matters.,Neutral
Intel,"Yup, these cards came out around the time of ps4 I think..that's a long time ago in the graphical quality of games we are seeing.  People should be happy to a point that those cards can even run some of these games if upscaling helps them run that's a bonus as it means they don't need to upgrade if those graphics settings are acceptable to them.",Positive
Intel,"I have a 5700 and it does better at 1080p on these games than what is normally posted. Now it does need quality fsr but its not the worst thing, anything lower than quality is. Bottom line is these are not 100% correct and never have been.  I have zero interest in this game but the specs seem fine even though I wish upscaling wasn't what was relied on for optimization.",Neutral
Intel,"well you dont know what they mean by 30 fps. It could be de 1% lows or the average, we dont know. The easy assumption is that it will be 30 fps average. but that's crazy that a game at 1080p low cant be run by a 5700. It better be a new Crysis.  edit: apparently it uses raytracing only for lighting which would explain the hows and why it crushes the framerate so bad especially on a gpu that doesnt have hardware raytracing like the 5700.",Negative
Intel,"Or in the case of games like Alan Wake 2, you will get unplayable fps if you try to running it at 4k native max settings. Even with a 4090, you will get a glorious 20fps.",Negative
Intel,Assassins creed origins and odyssey side quests/collectibles oh my god,Neutral
Intel,Yeah it doesn't give us a actual gauge to understand what we need for set native parameters. I mentioned optimization out of concern that they rely too much on upscaling and it seems like it's the lazy way out of something. It's unrealistic that a usable gaming experience be in a top tier hardware setup that costs $2k+ and top tier hardware of just the last generation are just barely cutting it anymore.,Negative
Intel,I appreciate your insights and opinions. Thank you.,Positive
Intel,">UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  Because they market how ""good"" it looks, not how ""well"" it runs. There's a big influence from marketing perspective to place high focus on ""eye candy"", it's what sells.  The how ""well"" it runs is usually restricted to the small % of us gaming nerds. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flip_out)",Neutral
Intel,console games started upscaling way before PCs .,Neutral
Intel,This sub is rife with crazy conspiracy theories. I don't think it was this insane a couple years back.,Negative
Intel,you forgot who owns one of the most popular engines out there?,Neutral
Intel,"I guess technically it would count but then everyone would flame it for looking bad. But seriouly, what happened when Ultra settings ran real smooth on top of the line hardware? Gone those times.",Negative
Intel,downvoted by devs lol,Neutral
Intel,> RTX 4080 is 50% Faster than RTX 3080.  The msrp is 71% higher too.,Positive
Intel,"Yeah at 1200 bucks and above you got one, that's true but many cards below didn't offer much.",Neutral
Intel,that's stoopid but it's somewhat more understandable. Why a 5700 would struggle so much since it doesnt have hardware raytracing,Negative
Intel,Yep it's like a 10/15% performance uplift in some games but I'd guess they would prefer to keep the requirements sheets somewhat simple.,Neutral
Intel,Why is there a dialog message about unsupported hardware when you try and run a 390X?,Negative
Intel,It can do software based RT just like every other modern GPU out there.,Neutral
Intel,Well then no wonder rx 5700 can't manage 30 fps lol,Neutral
Intel,"Wait so we are finally getting games made only with ray tracing in mind? This is actually great, 2023 is officially the year the new generation started",Positive
Intel,Avatars uses a Lumen like software RT solution.,Neutral
Intel,"yeah they never finished the sentence for some reason. The full sentences is ""its better than native, when native has forced taa!"" which is why dlaa/fsraa at native look so much better than the upscale versions. normal basic TAA is just so bad, that even upscales not using it look better than native using it",Negative
Intel,"The AA side of things might be better, but I swear no matter the resolution textures become a blurry mess even with Quality mode etc, and it irks me that most people don't seem to notice that.",Negative
Intel,Some people seem to have very low sensitivity to added blur. See also *depth of field blur* and *motion blur* being on by default in every game. It's funny how much people rage against FXAA/DoF/Motion blur but ignore DLSS.  Of course only one is tied to someone's purchasing decision :),Negative
Intel,"Yeah, thatsl happened.",Neutral
Intel,">every time I tell them that I can tell the difference between native and upscaled and it's not better then natibe they call me a liar and downvote  Well, yes, you are using shitty FSR which is literally unplayable no matter resolution instead of godly DLSS that is literally better than native even at 720p/performance. The only way you could have seen the ever unmatched DLSS for PC kings instead of the plebean FSR is through a compressed youtube video so your opinion is literally invalid. I hope I am being sarcastic enough.",Negative
Intel,"The problem is some (if not most) games have such a bad TAA it might as well be true, and if often cannot but turned off.",Negative
Intel,"""We could"" but not profitable. Just let imagine these games does not exist in our reality.",Negative
Intel,You didn't understand. It's another Swiss knife engine,Negative
Intel,"It is indeed not a great situation. Things like this shouldn't be forced on, and it leaves me feeling like they haven't given the devs enough time to optimize the settings.",Negative
Intel,It works because most consoles players are noobs they don't care about the tech. They just want to sit on the couch and play. I'm hoping we see them start working more on FSR3 and upgrading older games to it. And you are right nvidia will keep moving forward but so will AMD. They may never catch them since they have a head start.,Positive
Intel,AMD just released drivers for Alan Wake 2 that fixed the flickering while using FSR.,Neutral
Intel,The PS5 has a 6700.,Neutral
Intel,">I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?   Not exactly. It's a custom quasi-RDNA2 design (has the improved RDNA2 compute units, but it's missing a few features such as fully-DX12-compliant mesh shaders and VRS-capable ROPs).  For most purposes, it's pretty comparable to a 6700 (non-XT), with the same number of CUs (36), and similar clockspeeds.",Neutral
Intel,"Oh, wow. I didn't know that. But it'll likely be on a similar level as UE5, right?",Positive
Intel,Next gen DOES NOT MEAN that your CURRENT GEN hardware can run it well for sure... Why don't people get that?,Negative
Intel,That reminds me to grab moss 1 and 2. I just got a quest 3.   Agreed though. I’ve been waiting for kingdom hearts 3 to come to steam for so long that I’m basically going to skip it at this point. It’s still stuck on the epic game store.,Neutral
Intel,Far cry 6 and re4 are older and or lower demanding games.  And yes any Mode here does either Hardware or Software rt from. Min to max.,Neutral

Intel,TAA,Neutral
Intel,Temporal anti aliasing.,Neutral
Intel,"TAA is the devil. it forces a blur on every frame, and only gets worse as the resolution goes lower. its why fsr, xess, and dlss can look better than """"native"""" because it doesnt use the horrid plain taa solution so many games do. and why dlaa, and fsraa are so important and need to replace taa completely",Negative
Intel,"Ahh, welcome to r/FuckTAA",Neutral
Intel,Even 4K looks blurry with some implementations of TAA,Negative
Intel,they're giving you the bare minimum until your upgrade!,Neutral
Intel,Because they are built with upscaling in mind so they have a blurry looks intentionally as it works best with aggressive upscaling.,Neutral
Intel,"Not even close, you're completely out of your mind. The 5700xt is 9% faster than the 5700. The 1080ti is **32%** faster than a 1070 and the 2080 is **19%** faster than the 2070.   Source from techpowerup: [https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-5700-xt.c3339](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-5700-xt.c3339)",Negative
Intel,"Well the difference is only 256 shaders more on the 5700xt. The 5700xt has 2560 shaders and the 5700 2304. That's 11% more. That's not that much.  The 1080ti has 86% more cuda cores than the 1070, as well as more and faster memory. I would not compare now so haha",Neutral
Intel,"The 5700 and 5700xt is more like a 1070 and 1070ti situation. It's not that big a gap, and you can close it even tighter because the majority of RX 5700 cards can be flashed to a 5700xt bios tightening the gap farther.",Neutral
Intel,"The 1070 was released in 2016. Its already the end of 2023. That card belong to ps4 era. Wake up.   People in this sub are delusional, really.",Negative
Intel,Those are some dumbass expectations. Maybe you should correct them instead of blaming the developers for it.,Neutral
Intel,"The 6500XT offers $200 2016 performance. In fact its often worse because of how gimped it is interface wise. Its one of the worst products released in recent years.  Its not the game developers fault AMD pretty much rebadged the RX 480 4 times and they can't be expected to sink their optimization to that level.  RX 480, RX580, RX 5500XT and RX6500XT are virtualy the same product performance wise. RX 5500XT is the most consistent one of the lot offering a somewhat more modern arhitecture in its 8GB variant. The 6500XT on the other hand while on a newer arhitecture is an unmitigated disaster that is on par at best and sinks even below the RX580 when memory, bus and PCIE interface constrained.  The console baseline is around 6700XT/2070 Super/3060ti level. People better get used to that as its gonna become or already has become the norm for 1080p high settings gaming. The 5700 is upwards of 30% slower by default while also having less hardware features. Its gonna become the minimum norm going forward alongside the 2060's of your time.",Negative
Intel,"the 1070 was 2016, the 5700 was 2019. While both not new its not 10 years old like the PS4 (2013)",Neutral
Intel,This is literally only true if you use path tracing. I think you're trying to insinuate the game is unoptimized when it just scales really high with visual features if your hardware supports it. It straight up runs great for the visual features it uses.,Neutral
Intel,"That was exclusive to console releases, no? And never to the point of replacing AA sharpening and rendering the game from 720p…",Neutral
Intel,No I havent. AMD is bigger than Epic.,Negative
Intel,"Right, you'll have different complaints but complaints none the less even though the new Ultra might still look slightly better prior gen games and offer high FPS but people would complain that the graphics are not advancing fast enough, they look the same etc etc.  Yah those days are likely gone but it's hard to say if it's because the game is unoptimized or if the dev is really pushing the limits of what they can do graphically and use upscaling as a buffer because what they have in mind, or what they intend to show is too taxing for current hardware. We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it. This is why I've never in my life ever pre-ordered a game. I still don't understand why people do it (esp now that games are digital) but lot of people do. Then again I've never really paid for a ""skin"" or some other visual add-on so maybe that's what attracts people.  I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets. The presets are all relative anyways. There's no universal settings that define what each preset represents.  I just don't get the outrage on these minimum spec sheets compared to what the game is showing graphically. At least wait until it releases and we have some hard data.",Negative
Intel,"I'm also a dev dood sometimes it's literally a ""foutage de geugle"" I had a friend who talk about how shit devs in EA (the people who's making the engine) code and doesn't optimise",Negative
Intel,"The commenter I replied to said there wasn't a big generational improvement for GPUs, while I said there was. But I agree that 4080 is expensive for what it offers.",Neutral
Intel,It was the same price as a 3090 at launch and offers 90% more performance.  It was definitely a generational leap.,Positive
Intel,It's software ray tracing which isn't accelerated by hardware.,Neutral
Intel,and i guess it can be hard to tell if ram is dual or single rank with just two sticks of it too.,Neutral
Intel,>might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.  I was pointing out that 1070 doesn't have hardware RT either.,Negative
Intel,So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?,Negative
Intel,"Why not make it toggleable though, you can choose other graphics settings so it makes no sense. Most people don't play games with RT enabled",Negative
Intel,Still kinda weird that they put the RX 5700/A750 on the same ballpark as the 1070... Being that the newer GPUs actually perform closer to a 1080(Ti).,Neutral
Intel,Sounds like improperly configured negative LOD bias. If you have Nvidia you can fix it with nvinspector. On AMD there's nothing you can do IIRC if Devs mess it up.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly what I'm telling them all the time, that I can see difference in textures, in hair, fences, powerlines etc. And every time I get downvoted by the army of ""but it looks better then native"". I feel like majority of that sub needs to go get a prescription for new glasses",Negative
Intel,"So if you stopped measuring who's bigger, why do you think I have no access to DLSS? Tested on rig with 4080 on a C2 42"" screen. Once you stop thinking with the tip of your head where probably Nvidia's logo is tattooed or maybe Jensen's face, who knows, you could come to realization that one person have access to more hardware then only his personal rig.  Do I say that FSR is better then DLSS? No! Both of them have their issues, but none of them is better then native. Keep on fanboying mate, instead of providing normal convoy as grownups",Neutral
Intel,I don't think YOU understand what you're talking about.  Did you seriously expect Snowdrop to be something used in like one game and then discarded completely?,Negative
Intel,"The thing is: creating good looking lightning with RT is much easier than with prebaked illumination. I can fully understand, why developers of new games are using RT as the basis of their game.",Positive
Intel,Minimum requirements go up as games get/look better. They probably made this game with the series s as the minimum. Low settings probably looks better than high in most games.   Rt for the last few years has been added on top of already complete games. Now games are being made with rt as the standard and they would have to manually do a ton of extra work to support 7+ year old hardware. It's the same as having to drop support for last gen consoles to be able to deliver a better game.,Neutral
Intel,"And still - superior upscaling makes it worth paying extra, RT on higher end is worth paying extra. AMD even this gen doesn't undercut price by enough, especially in EU where power efficiency also play a role. For example, assuming I'm gonna use GPU for 2 gens, then I save ~90-100€ with my usage just on electricity alone. I know it's over period of 4 years, but still it's price difference that will recoup over time, even if I have to pay extra upfront. AMD is simply no longer a value proposition.",Neutral
Intel,"They did not, lol - that fixes completely different thing, not the FSR caused shimmering edges.",Negative
Intel,Both excellent 👌 Down the Rabbit Hole was another solid one.,Positive
Intel,"RE4 came out this year.  Anyway the difference between us is I don't think any lighting effect is worth a $1,000 GPU using 1080p resolution and 60fps, but I know many disagree. That's life.",Neutral
Intel,"3600 and the 3300x was built with the TSMC 7nm if i recall, that was 2018 cutting edge tech. and somehow in gaming it's already obsolete. i was planning to replace mine with 5700x  but i cancel it because it's still very much capable for what i do now. but now after UE5 i think i'll reconsider it again, maybe even as far as 5800X3D",Neutral

Intel,"Out of curiosity what resolution do you usually game at and at what distance? I find taa usually looks pretty good in modern games, but I'm also playing on a TV (48 inches but I'm not at monitor distance anymore). When I played on my 1920x1200 monitor I HATED TAA, well, not as much as fxaa, but moreso than smaa, and I missed msaa or SGSSAA with a passion. Now on the TV at 4k (lol, usually not on a 6700xt), 1440p, or even 1080p I find TAA can do a pretty decent job paired with varying levels of the Radeon sharpness adjustment in the adrenaline drivers. But again, probably due to viewing distance.  Looks leagues better than FXAA and I prefer it to SMAA now. But again, I'm sitting further away and tweaking sharpening to my liking. FSR2 seems to be a wash most of the time but the performance gain is worth it.",Positive
Intel,You dumbass do understand that even the console version of the recent games are total mess? Alan wake 2 have to run on reduced settings to even reach 30fps on xbox/PS. Callisto protocol used to have frametime issue on consoles. Console ports still targets 30fps on quality settings with upscaling while target should be 60fps with 120fps for performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, seems you are correct, it was the ps4 pro that came out in 2016, still, I wouldn't expect that to be capable of running some of the games we are seeing now without some serious compromises.",Neutral
Intel,I never said that Alan Wake 2 is unoptimised. I just said that even a 4090 can’t max out the game at native 4K resolution.,Negative
Intel,epic is tencent...,Neutral
Intel,"In terms of absolute numbers sure, 3090 always had a stupid price tho for being 10% faster than a 3080.   In terms of performance per dollar the 4090 even at 2x 3080 performance was worse value since you pay 1600 not 1400.",Negative
Intel,"Yes, you either have to get the spec sheet of the RAM modules (That even then it may not specify if it's a single/dual rank module) or test it in a system and use HWinfo/CPU-Z. Not as straightforward as dual channel that's mostly just using two identical modules.",Neutral
Intel,You don't need RT hardware to do software RT. That's what I'm saying.,Neutral
Intel,"For this particular game, there is a software fallback. Also, even if we did get a game that mandated hardware support for RT they'd still likely build it with console in mind so even RDNA2 GPUs shouldn't have issues",Neutral
Intel,"The first RT/DLSS capable cards are 5 years old now, way older than the current consoles. You are definitely not being left behind if you're only outdated by 1 gen lol",Neutral
Intel,I mean the last non ray tracing cards were released 4 years ago (1650/60 and 5000s from AMD),Neutral
Intel,Games running poorly on computers weaker than current gen consoles isn't exactly anything new.,Negative
Intel,"No, you have multiple generations of games from prior to raytracing to enjoy.  Games shouldn't be held back forever just because someone wants to game on a GeForce2 MX400.",Negative
Intel,You are stuck playing older games. Unless someone can find a way to disable it with a mod.,Negative
Intel,> So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?  A gen old is second gen RT e.g. rtx 3000.  We're halfway through the third RT/matrix generation right now.,Negative
Intel,Yes hah,Neutral
Intel,"The 3090 or 6950xt will very likely run this game extremely well, they're a gen old.",Positive
Intel,"For the AMD GPU, it's probably because minimum will be the max it will support. Medium probably requires Hardware RT.  For Intel, I don’t know. Perhaps it signal not so great optimization for Intel GPUs...",Neutral
Intel,DLSS is very strong in thin lines like fences & hair. Much better than most TAA solutions. Not sure about FSR in general.  An example: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6erA6BVkAAuf_M?format=jpg&name=large  Only DLSS resolves the lines properly.,Neutral
Intel,"I mean, it's not that black and white. Quality upscaling to 1080 will obviously be more noticeable than 4k. Maybe you *can* tell the difference between 4k native and dlss quality, but people aren't gonna believe you unless you prove it with some kind of blind test, but I doubt you'd be willing to go out of your way to do that.  Even if you could, the benefits of better aa might outweight some negligible drop in textures or whatever it is upscaling reduces. Though that's irrelevant when DLAA or NAA are options too, I guess.",Neutral

Intel,Nice. It’s on the list. Thanks man,Positive
Intel,Yes.... 7nm was but 4 cores the actual important thing was obsolete like 10 or 12 years ago.,Neutral
Intel,Probably because TAA is (unfortunately) more prevalent than it ever was.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, most people are FINE with it. Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  The thing is, you have sharpening filters today. You can adjust the sharpening for TAA. You can make it look oversharpened if you want. There's driver level sharpening for both AMD and NVIDIA. Both also have software sharpening filters.  And DLSS and FSR bot have sharpening sliders.  There's 3 ways to adjust how blurry and how sharp the game looks for everyone. It's a non issue and even Digital Foundry acknowledges the benefits of TAA for game devs vs things like the blur. At the end of the day, these games are looking great...in this era, with exceptions. Not all games are blur. The whole blur thing was like in the past 4 years since upscalers started and TAA became the norm. But with all the sharpening options, and with devs actually used to making TAA not so soft looking, things are definitely getting a lot better for TAA.",Neutral
Intel,Oh my bad if I read that wrong,Negative
Intel,And I'm saying 1070 doesn't have hardware RT so it's just as gimped as AMD cards when doing RT.,Negative
Intel,Still pretty annoying nonetheless. Until it's stable no way should it be forced upon a game when someone's willing to run it normally at native.,Negative
Intel,"and the 2080ti is still winning, best purchase in gpu i made in a long time.",Positive
Intel,imagine being mad that 4 year old cards arent high end,Neutral
Intel,I'm on a 6700XT. 🙇. I just feel very shocked that I would probably need a gpu upgrade soon. With the demands of new games. Also 1440p ruined me.,Negative
Intel,"Technically makes sense, but they can just make RT something you can toggle between Software/Hardware and they also could just add the Vega 56 in the requirement sheet being that was AMD's competitor to the 1070 or they could've added the GTX 1080(Ti)/RTX 2060(Super) into the sheet.  On Intel's side they only have the A580 as the closest GPU to a 1070, even when it's too similar to the A750 performance wise :/",Neutral
Intel,"It is that black and white for me. I can immediately see the added image softness from upscaling, and it's especially prevalent with DLSS 2.5+ unless you enable a sharpening filter. DLAA also has weird issues like blurring textures (almost like it reverts to initial mipmap) while moving, usually at mid-distance from camera. It's too distracting and I have to go back to regular TAA. Immediately goes away.  1440p to 2160p is better than 720p to 1080p, but it's still noticeable. Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible? No. Actually changing monitor resolution outside of native and having all UI elements scaled looks terrible. That was what we used to do and upscaling is much better than that alternative. LCD panels need to stay at native signal resolution and GPU should scale render resolutions.",Negative
Intel,"And you look at static image all the time while gaming? It's different story when movement is involved, that's where you find all the artefacts you get. Static image doesn't tell a thing when it comes to gaming",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, and that's driving me crazy. I really couldn't stand it in Cyberpunk (in other titles it's either hit or miss), that I play it in native 4k instead.",Negative
Intel,"Wouldn't phrase it like that tough. I had that choice too in January, and actually by going 4070Ti instead of 7900XT I would be able to play Cyberpunk in higher fidelity and better frames then on mine, because AMD cooked FSR3.0 almost a year in the oven, and God knows how long it will take for CDPR to add it to the game, if ever considering that active development on game is ended and they are on bug fixing sprint right now. Also AMD needs to fix FSR in general, because how it works with smaller details like hair and fences is awful. But don't get me wrong, I love my card, just feel I git sold on features that would come handy right kow instead of when I don't need them anymore",Neutral
Intel,"Sorry mate, guess I need to read comments early morning instead of late night, just saw that last bit. My apologies. I'm just tired of upscalare wars whatever sub I go, and green team fanboys screaming that ""FSR is shit, DLSS is better then native"" and then throwing around static images for comparison",Negative
Intel,"It's for textures, not object edges from FSR use, lol. Two completely different things",Neutral
Intel,"people echoing the same shit like ""ooh 4C is obsolete, you need to upgrade that geriatric cpu"". 4C is still solid for gaming (ofc no UE5) and literally anything beside doing compute intensive professional workloads.",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening makes the image less blurry, but it doesn't recover the texture detail lost from TAA blur.",Negative
Intel,"""Even Nvidia foundry""   \---   they are like chief proponents of blur-tech and they don't care about how sharp and easy-to-see the image is. TAA flattens the image so you can't see which objects are far and which are near, you have to strain your eyes and mind to determine that which is unbearable to many. Just give us option to disable it even if it breaks some effects (which is just lazy thing to do on the side of devs)",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening fixes blur, not clearity. That is TAA destroys+add significant ghosting no matter the implementation.      Sharpening looks was worse than the normal cleairy of games, it's not the same thing at all.      >Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  We are mad because it being forced 1 and 2 it's being used to hide lazy effects that break without temporal frame smearing. People are now punished for turning off forced frame smearing.",Negative
Intel,And I'm saying that maybe the GTX 1070 is better at even software RT compared to AMD cards with no RT hardware. GTX 10 series card did get RTX support through CUDA even though they were horribly bad at it. Older AMD cards with no RT hardware didn't get any support like that from AMD.,Neutral
Intel,"You're not forced to use upscaling though. Unless you replied to the wrong person this is about ray tracing, which can be run at native just fine. If your GPU can't handle RT at native res, then just use upscaling.",Neutral
Intel,The minimum requirements for this game includes de 1070: a 7-year-old gpu from 2016.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm not really shocked, and was out there telling people not to buy those cards on day 1 in large part because of their deficiencies in RT performance and complete lack of matrix accelerators (which Nvidia and Intel have both made a large part of their architecture and got shockingly good results with - DLSS and matrix-XeSS are twice as good as FSR)",Negative
Intel,5700 was probably the lowest AMD card they had to test with.,Neutral
Intel,"It also looks better in gameplay, less ghosting, less shimmering, less aliasing.   So which one looks better? You clearly see the difference in textures/fences/powerline, right?  I even made it easier for you, both images are 1080p output.",Positive
Intel,I personally didn't try DLSS even once but FSR 2.0 does have shimmering I notice to various degrees. It was very noticable on fur in Ratchet & Clank cutscenes for example. Overall I am just happy my 5700xt could still keep up with 1440p.,Negative
Intel,Hmm yeah whatever you want to believe and let's you sleep.  Have a nice day.,Positive
Intel,AMD CAS is aimed to restore detail,Neutral
Intel,"They aren’t chief proponents of anything, TAAU has been popular for well over a decade at this point and it’s the default approach for consoles (checkerboarding has moire and aliasing issues) and digital foundry simply recognizes this is the reality of how the console world has settled on doing graphics.",Neutral
Intel,The problem with Nvidia is they are massively overpriced. One 4080 would probably cost the same as my whole build or more.,Negative
Intel,"Yes I see which one looks better, and as I said before it's a static image. While I didn't use upscaling in this same exact example, I can go by my own experience and tell that it doesn't look better then native let's say in same Cyberpunk or any other game. And I will beleive my own eyes on my own screen then static images tossed around. TBH, in my opinion it all depends on screen and screen size too, as to me that difference between upscaled and native was less noticible on my old 27"" 1440p screen then it is now on 42"" 4k. DLAA tough, that's another story",Neutral
Intel,"I tried both, and neither of them are better then native as people tend to claim. In my testing FSR have big problem with smaller details like hair, fur, fences, powerlines and as you mentioned, you get severe shimmering effect. I really hope AMD will keep on working on it, an try to get away from that. But DLSS also adds shimmer, it's just less visible then in FSR (atleast in my testing on Cyberpunk pre 2.0), and whatever upscaling method I've used I also could see that image is upscaled (lower res textures here and there etc.). I like idea being upscaling tech, it helps prolong life of GPUs, and for more powerful GPUs to run higher settings with more fidelity, but there's still work to do on them as they aren't perfect yet.",Negative
Intel,Yeah but a 3060ti didn't,Neutral
Intel,"In Cyberpunk you are not comparing upscaling vs no upscaling at the same settings though. You are comparing low RT native vs path traced upscaling and at 4K, the decission there is absolutely clear. On my 4k OLED screen, upscaled PT is so clearly the way to go, there is no competition.",Neutral
Intel,"The gameplay looks exactly like the image + your typical TAA/DLSS smearing. And as I said, in my example DLSS also looks better in gameplay, because as you see... native has a ton of aliasing which is super noticeable while playing (shimmering). There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling. Talking about native is nonesense, just image quality counts and thats were DLSS or even FSR 2 (some games) gets better and better. There is a reason why consoles use it... it looks better than without it.",Positive

Intel,It's a good thing nobody has to actually play it native.,Neutral
Intel,Well good thing literally nobody is doing that…,Negative
Intel,The future is not in native resolution so this is really pointless information.  Cyberpunk looks absolutelt mindblowlingy insane with all the extra graphical bells and whistles it has gotten over the years and with Nvidia’s technology it runs so damn smooth as well.,Positive
Intel,4.3fps lol. No amount of upscaling is going to fix that and make it playable. People were saying the 7900xtx had 3090ti levels of RT when it launched. A 4060 ti is 50% faster then it.,Negative
Intel,That's actually pretty amazing for any GPU to get a metric in frames per second instead of minuites per frame.,Positive
Intel,"Meh I get like 90+ fps with everything cranked with RR, FG and DLSS(Balanced) toggled on with my 4090 @ 4k.  Path tracing does introduce ghosting which is annoying buts not really noticeable most times but at the same time with RR enabled it removes shimmering on 99% of objects that is normally introduced with DLSS so I am willing to compromise.   Honestly as someone who used to have a 7900XTX I am disappointed with AMD its clear that AI tech in gaming is the way forward and they just seem so far behind Nvidia now and even Intel(going by some preview stuff). FSR is just not even comparable anymore.",Negative
Intel,Who cares when it looks worse than with dlss and ray reconstruction on top of running a lot worse? Native res 4k is pointless.,Negative
Intel,"Well the upscaling in this game is really good, DLSS with ray reconstructions AI accelerated denoiser provides better RT effects than the game at native with its native Denoiser.  Also Path tracing scales perfectly with resolution so upscaling provides massive gains. using DLSS quality doubles performance to 40fps, and dlss balanced gives 60fps on average, performance about 70-80 or 4x native 4K, that includes the 10-15% performance gain RR gives as well over the native denoiser as well.  I've been playing with about 60fps on average 50-70. with DLSS Balanced and RR and its been amazing. I don't like frame gen tho since it causes VRR flickers on my screen",Positive
Intel,"Running Ray Tracing or Path Tracing without DLSS or Ray Reconstruction is like intentionally going into a battlefield without any gear whatsoever, it's absolutely pointless and suicidal, what we can clearly see here though is top of the line 7900 XTX losing against already mediocre mid-range 4060 Ti by over 50%, which is just beyond embarrassing for AMD Radeon.  All this says to me is AMD Radeon need to get their shit together and improve their RT / PT performance, otherwise they will continue to lose more Marketshare on GPU department no matter how hard their fanboys thinks that they are pointless features, just like DLSS was back on 2020 right?  Also, with my 4070 Ti OC i can run it at average of over 60 FPS at 1440p DF optimized settings with DLSS Balanced + Ray Reconstruction without even using DLSS Frame Gen, with it on i can get over 80+ FPS",Negative

Intel,"I have a 13900KF-4090 rig and a 7800X3D-7900XTX rig. They are connected to a C2 OLED and to a Neo G9.  I've been holding on to play the game till 2.0 update. I've tried many times with different ray-tracing options and they all look good and all. But in the end I closed them all, turned back to Ultra Quality without ray-tracing and started playing the game over 120FPS.  This is a good action fps game now. I need high fps with as low latency as possible. So who cares about ray-tracing and path-tracing.  Yeah ray-tracing and path-tracing are good. But we are at least 2-3 generations away for them to become mainstream. When they are easily enabled on mid-range gpus with high-refresh rate monitors, they will be good and usable then :)",Positive

Intel,"""Get Nvidia if you want a good ray tracing experience""  Yes Nvidia GPUs give a better ray tracing experience but is it really worth it if you are required to turn on DLSS? Imo, the more AI-upscaling you have to turn on, the worse the Nvidia purchase is.   I have a 6900XT and I will readily admit that the RT experience (ultra RT, no path tracing) at native 1080p resolution is ok, like 30-45 FPS (around 50 on medium RT settings), but if I turn RT lighting off (so RT shadows, sunlight, and reflections are still present) suddenly I get pretty consistent 60 FPS (i left my frames tied to monitor refresh rate, so 60 FPS is my max) and i can't tell the damn difference at native 1080p compared to RT medium or Ultra.   So would I spend another $400-$1000 to get an imperceptible outcome (imperceptible to me that is)? Most definitely not.",Negative

Intel,"Once they introduced this dlss upscaling anti-lag all these gimmicks I don't think we've seen true 4K native and almost anything lately.  This is maybe one game that does look that good but many of the games don't look that great and have some really serious system requirements when there are games that look much better and are much better optimized.  Companies are taking shortcuts, instead of optimizing they give you suboptimal and use FSR dlss all these gimmicks.  Don't get me wrong I always thought it was great for people who wanted to reach a certain frames per second someone with a weaker system to allow them to play at least the minimal at a steady frame rate.  It just seems like this is the normal now non-optimized games.  The 4090 is a beast if you could only get about 20 frames native with Ray tracing it tells you everything you need to know about Ray tracing.  It needs to be reworked that needs to be a new system I believe one real engine has it built in in a certain way probably not as good as Ray tracing directly.  To me it seems like ray tracing is hampering many games that tried to add it, too much focus on that instead of actual making a good game.

Intel,I'm willing to bet hardware improvement will come to a halt before that.,Neutral
Intel,"In 10 years AI based upscaling will be so good, no one will want to natively render unless they are generating training data",Neutral
Intel,Transistor density advancements have been declining for a good while now. We can't expect hardware performance gains of old to continue into the future,Positive
Intel,Like the 1080 barely doing 4k30 and now we have gpus that do 4k120 id way heavier games.  Its still weord to me to see 4k120,Negative
Intel,But then the current gen games of that era will run like this. The cycle continues,Neutral
Intel,TRUE! i think 5-10 years was the actual point in time where anybody should have paid their hard earned dollar for raytracing gpus. instead ppl dished out $1000s for the RTX2080/Ti and now are sitting on them waiting for raytracing to happen for them xD,Neutral
Intel,Who knows what new tech will be out in even 4 years lol,Neutral
Intel,"And that’s when I’ll turn on this setting in my games. Fuck having to pay $1600 for a sub 30fps experience. Path tracing is far from being a viable option, it’s more like a proof of concept at this point.",Negative
Intel,"You wish, GPU makers have stagnated like it's crazy, even the graphics have peaked. I expected to see CGI level graphics like Transformers now",Negative
Intel,"...but will cost your everlasting soul, body, firstborn and parents. If it's on sale.",Neutral
Intel,It is path trancing though. The technology used by Pixar to make Toy Story 4 (though they spent up to 1200 CPU hours for one frame) Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story. And they had their supercomputers working on it. It is a miracle of modern technology that it even runs real time.,Positive
Intel,"You basically need a 4090 to crack 60 fps at 1440p w/ dlss on quality without frame gen. It looks good, but not good enough to run out and buy a 4090.",Negative
Intel,"Same card, I just turned off RT at 4K. 75-120fps is better than 40 with muddy but accurate reflections",Positive
Intel,"The 7900xtx is one of the worst gpus iv ever had lol on paper it looks so so good, In games it just play isn’t. Fsr is garbage, 4080 mops the floor with it :( plus the drivers from amd besides starfield have been awful this generation",Negative
Intel,I think that most of the progress will go together with software tricks and upscalers.,Neutral
Intel,"lol. And you missed the 2080Ti.   Every result under 10 fps is just to be ignored, it isn't representing anything outside of ""woot, the card managed to chuck a frame our way"".",Negative
Intel,That's VRAM for you,Neutral
Intel,we are counting decimals of fps its just all margin of error.,Neutral
Intel,If you buy a card with low ram that card is for right now only lol,Neutral
Intel,Wake me up when a $250 GPU can run this at 1080p.,Neutral
Intel,Well DLSS isn't best. DLAA is,Negative
Intel,Reviews have been saying that the game looks better with DLSS than native. Not to mention runs extremely better.,Positive
Intel,Can’t you just disable TAA? Or do you just have to live with the ghosting?,Neutral
Intel,TAA is garbage in everything. TAA and FSR can both get fucked,Negative
Intel,"Yeah. 70 to 100fps on a 4080, but with 3440x1440 and DLSS-quality-FG-RR (nvidia needs new nomenclature....)",Neutral
Intel,"same, high refreshrate at 4k with optimized settings + PT + FG. With a 4080 of course, it's insane that it can look and run this great.",Positive
Intel,"Not exactly. Path tracing is just ray tracing, but cranked up to 99% with the least amount of rasterization possible.",Neutral
Intel,"> Give it 2 gens and you are going to get 4k60 here.  Assuming the 5090 literally doubles a 4090 (unlikely), that only gets us to 4K 40hz.  Assuming a 6090 doubles that, 80. which won't be bad.  Going with more conservative 50% boosts. 5090 will give 30. 6090 will give 45.  And i feel like 50% is being very generous, as nvidia have claimed moores law is dead and they can't advance beyond a 4090 by much. I'd guess we get 30% uplift in 5090 and maybe 10-15% uplift in 6090. So we'd still be under 4K30.",Neutral
Intel,Imagine buying a 4090 and then using upscaling.,Neutral
Intel,Path tracing is so much more demanding than ray tracing due to light scattering being modelled. It is a marvel it even runs.,Positive
Intel,PC gaming is in Crysis.,Neutral
Intel,Well it's a good thing 99.999999% of PC gamers don't give a shit about ray or path tracing.,Negative
Intel,You're the first other person other than myself I've run into that had an XTX but ended up with a 4090 in the end.,Neutral
Intel,"Plus frame generation works very well in Cyberpunk in terms of image quality. In some games, you need to get closer to ~80 fps output for an acceptable image quality with FG. But the FG in CP2077 is decent with 60 fps output, ~~and I get ~65-70 fps output with quality DLSS + FG at 4k on a 4090.~~ EDIT: I misremembered what I was getting. With path tracing, DLSS quality, frame generation, and ray reconstruction, I got 80.1 fps with the benchmark!  Of course there's the matter of latency, and the latency of CP2077 with FG output of ~65-70 fps isn't great. So I'll often use DLSS balanced + FG. Thanks to ray reconstruction, this now looks very close enough native 4k (to my eyes), with acceptable latency (to me), at a high framerate output.",Positive
Intel,"Nvidia features are always useless until AMD copies them a year or two later, only then they become great features 😁",Positive
Intel,"Tbh, list the games that have ray tracing right now. Pretty few.  It's not about being a fanboy of amd, but ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick, not because it's unnoticeable or bad, just because it's not ""popular"" (I myself really like it). I would personally go amd over nvidia because those 50 or so euros more that nvidia has against the amd counter parts simply are too much for just better rt and  dlss. I could spend those for a better amd card with generally better performance.  Regarding dlss, personally I would just lower the graphics before resorting to kinda bad generated frames, fsr even worse. But that's my point of view.  I find that amd still has to fix some driver issues but other than that, they are a fine brand. (so is nvidia)",Negative
Intel,Yeh because native 4k looks worse than dlss + RR 4k,Negative
Intel,"Yeah the game with DLSS, RR and path tracing at 1440p looks amazing and with very high fps",Positive
Intel,What's the point of having $5000 PC when you're still gonna have literally the same graphics as $1000 PC then?,Negative
Intel,"This is a tech demo. That's the whole point. It's not really playable yet, but the game really is meant to showcase what is possible in the future and how close we are getting. That's what Nvidia is doing here by funding this whole project.  Crysis who many people are comparing this to, was in itself quite revolutionary for its time. The destructible environment in Crysis to this day holds up, and that was it's killer feature really.  You're gonna have swings at the future that miss as well, and that's ok.",Negative
Intel,"Did you try DLSS?  Imagine getting down voted for asking if he was using DLSS. What a fragile community. Sometimes it's okay to use DLSS, other times you better not or people will come to your house with torches",Negative
Intel,VRAM,Neutral
Intel,"Depends on what you are after i guess, is it worth it for me? Absolutely, DLSS+FG+RR with PT is a great experience.",Positive
Intel,still better than 90% of games in 2023,Positive
Intel,Arguably better now Ray Reconstruction has been added. It's quite a big image quality upgrade.,Positive
Intel,"…no it does not, unfortunately. Have you seen the artifacting in Cyberpunk?",Negative
Intel,"Someone ate up the marketing. I often see people wonder why games are so unoptimized today, your answer is right here. \^",Negative
Intel,All graphics you see on your computer screen is fake,Negative
Intel,Path tracing is more demanding than Ray tracing,Neutral
Intel,"That's why I downscale from 1440p to 1080p, running DLSS and using Contrast Limited Sharpening. It looks better than native resolution and still performs well.",Positive
Intel,I guess between the 3090 and the 4070,Neutral
Intel,Yep hahaha,Neutral
Intel,RemindMe! 7 years,Neutral
Intel,"No, this tech is around so game developers can sell more copies of their games by making them look better. The only reason why Nvidia is winning is because their GPUs are much better at intensive ray-tracing.",Positive
Intel,"This is an absurd, fanboyish thought lmao",Neutral
Intel,dont let novidia marketing see this youll get down voted into oblivion,Negative
Intel,I would still argue it's still in proof of concept stage. The tech will only become viable once the flagship GPU'S start getting 4k 60fps at native. That will the allow the lower end GPU'S to get 4k 60 or 1440p 60 upscaled.,Neutral
Intel,I mean I have no problem playing at 30fps dlss balance at 1080p DF optimized settings on a 2080ti with pathtracing idc what anyone says RT/PT is the future it just looks so much better than Rasterization,Positive
Intel,"Possibly a little more. Assuming that the leaked 1.7x improvement is right and path tracing performance scales the same, that would be about 34 fps at 4k native. Might be possible to hit 60fps or close to it with DLSS Quality.",Neutral
Intel,It could as well do 60fps if Nvidia adds a lot of path tracing HW into the GPU.,Neutral
Intel,Fanboyism of both kinds is bad,Negative
Intel,"It won't end, but hopefully we see games that have art designed with RT lighting and reflections in mind.  Cyberpunk isn't it. We'd need a full rebuild of the game, every location, every asset and surface remade, so it looks like originally intended by the artists.",Neutral
Intel,Since it needs more than 10gb vram,Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is more optimized than majority of games that came out in last two years. Just because you can't run it at 4k 120 fps with path tracing doesn't mean it's not optimized.,Positive
Intel,It’s not unoptimized at all. Game runs great for the quality of the graphics. You guys just don’t understand the insane amount of power path tracing takes. The fact you can do it at all rn is insane but once again people just throw “unoptimized” at it because they don’t understand the technical marvel happening in front of their eyes.,Negative
Intel,"No, this game is actually very well optimized. It's just extremely demanding at 4k native, which is why DLSS exists.  It would be unoptimized if it ran like this while looking like nothing special, but this is probably the game with the best graphics, period. At the very least, it's certainly the game with the best lighting.",Positive
Intel,"and people will be like ""well RT is the future""  raster was fine for over 15 years and raster games look great but we get it we must let incompetent game devs and their bosses make shit quality games because average gamer is ready to spend $100 to pre-order electronic version of horse shit and then justify it for years because they can't admit they wasted money",Negative
Intel,It's settled that you have no idea what you talking about,Negative
Intel,Its full path tracing u cannot really optimize this much.,Negative
Intel,"It always did. Most games don't scale well, Cyberpunk does.  Look at the last two years of pc ports and you will understand how cyberpunk looks and performs like it's black magic.",Neutral
Intel,"Baked illumination requires you to choose where to add light sources and how the lighting is applied to everything, it's a creative choice of the author, the AI needs instructions to know what to do, so it would need constant handholding, on the other hand RT uses simple physics to calculate how light bounced and NN to apply the light on surfaces.",Neutral
Intel,But the destructable environment and the water graphics and other things in Direct X 9 made high end pcs kneel as well.  I remember playing on my 9800gtx/+ with my Intel Q9300 quad core (lapped and oc'ed to 3.0ghz - EDIT: checked some old evga posts got it to 3.33ghz) with 2x4gigs DDR2 @1000mhz cas 5 trying to maintain a sustained 30fps at 900p resolution on my 1680x1050 monitor. And I oc'ed the crap out of that 9800gtx 835 mhz (cant recall if it was unlinked shadder or not now) core on blower air (won the silicon lottery with that evga card).  Tweaking settings was mostly user done and guided with old school limited forum help. Ahh the good old days of having lots of time during school breaks.,Neutral
Intel,"The equivalent of a 4090 at the time, 8800 ultra (768MB) got 7.5 fps at 1920x1200 very high quality. The other cards were not able to run it. Even the lowest tier last generation card runs this, even though it's at 5% speed.",Neutral
Intel,No and no again lol  The 8800gtx could do 1152x864 high and that was the top dog. DX9 cards could do that at medium but high shaders was like a 25fps average tops and that dropped into the teens on the snow level.   It took things like the gtx480 and HD 6970 to do 1920x1080 30fps max settings. That's before getting into Sandy Bridge being the first cpu that could sustain 40+ fps if the gpu power was there.   Crysis came during the core 2 duo/k8 athlon and first wave dx10 cards era and it took *2 more generations* of *both* gpus and cpus to do it some justice.,Neutral
Intel,"My 8800ultra was getting single digit fps at 1080p ultra, so CP isn't quite as demanding.",Neutral
Intel,Amd had a tessellation unit. It went unused but it was present,Neutral
Intel,"My fun story for PhysX was Mirrors Edge. I don't remember what GPU I had at the time but the game was pretty new when I played it. Ran fine for quite some time until one scene where you get ambushed in a building by the cops and they shoot at the glass. The shattering glass with PhysX turned on absolutely TANKED my framerates, like single digit. I didn't realize that the PhysX toggle was turned on in the settings. This was at a time when PhysX required a dedicated PCIe card in your system.   Once I turned it off it ran fine. Now I can run that game at ridiculous framerates without my system getting warm.",Positive
Intel,"I remember around about 2008 when companies like Asus and Dell were selling ""Physics Processing Units"" and some claimed that these would be commonplace in gaming machines just like Graphics cards had become 10 years previously.",Neutral
Intel,"Hardware accelerated physics (as in on the gpu), is different than what's going on the CPU.",Neutral
Intel,hobbies quaint consist aromatic political hat aback boat relieved crush   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*,Neutral
Intel,"People used to have ATI/AMD for main and a lower-end NVIDIA for PhysX.  When NVIDIA found this out they pushed out drivers that disabled PhysX on their cards if an ATI/AMD card was detected, limiting you to the intentionally piss-poor CPU implementation of PhysX.  Think about that crap.  One day everything's going fine for consumers, the next day NVIDIA decides they don't like how consumers are legitimately using their cards and gimps everyone, weaponizing a physics engine company that they bought in 2008.",Negative
Intel,"Oh damn, I forgot about those cards.  I wanted one so badly.",Positive
Intel,Remember when companies tried to sell physics cards lol,Neutral
Intel,>PhysX  It never was a dedicated Nvidia card - it was a [dedicated psysx](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/bfg-ageia-physx-card/) on which the tech later was bought by Nvidia and implemented in it's own GPU's.  But the things never became really populair.,Neutral
Intel,"This makes me wonder if we'll ever see something similar with Raytracing, where we get a 2nd GPU purely for RT, and then the main GPU just does all the other stuff. Would that even be possible?",Neutral
Intel,I remember when people had a dedicated PhysX card.,Neutral
Intel,The ray/path tracing in this case done by specialized hardware which has more room to grow faster.,Neutral
Intel,"I would, transistor shrinking isn't the only method of increasing performance, and honestly, these companies have to keep putting out better cards to make money.  There have been many breakthroughs over the last few years. I give it another 5 as both amd and nvidia are pushing ai accelerated ray tracing on their cards, nvidia is in the lead for now but amd will eventually catch up.",Positive
Intel,There is still a big leap possible since all lithography processes at the moment are hybrid euv and duv.   But the moment everything is done euv things will drastically slow down.,Neutral
Intel,"No those are just pennies in the pocket of Nvidia, but as the consequence you as the customer need to take a mortgage on a brand new GPU.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah the next 10 years are gonna be spent getting budget cards up to 4090 level performance, rather than bringing the bleeding edge to 5-10x the 4090 performance. As long as 4K is king, there’s not much incentive to do the latter.",Negative
Intel,"In 10 years we will be begging one of several thousand test-tube created Musk Family members for $200 so we can buy a cheeseburger.  But the jokes on them, we’re just gonna spend it on space crack.",Negative
Intel,"Never. Even if performance can be pushed that far, by the time it happens there won't be such a thing as a $200 graphics card anymore.",Negative
Intel,It's not happening unless the market crashes and they start focusing on offering good price/performance cards instead of bumping up prices every generation.,Negative
Intel,25 years,Neutral
Intel,"The software needs to run on hardware, right now it eats through GPU compute and memory.",Neutral
Intel,And sadly ended up with 450 Watt TDP to achieve that performance.,Negative
Intel,This. We'd be lucky to see more than 3 generations in the upcoming decade.,Positive
Intel,"Having seen a few newer games on relatively low resolution CRT display, I can't help but think it might come down to improved display tech and embedded scaling. Like DLSS3 features in the display instead of the GPU.",Neutral
Intel,Not with that attitude,Negative
Intel,Love how it's still gimped on memory size 😂,Positive
Intel,"They just need to render the minimum information needed , and let the ai do the rest",Neutral
Intel,"Don't get upscaling, to me it looks shite. Why spend hundreds or thousands on a GPU to not even run at native resolution.   It's something Nvidia are pushing because they've got a better version of it at the moment.  Maybe it'll improve, it's pretty much snake oil currently imo.",Negative
Intel,"Feels pretty good with 120 frames. Playing with a controller, i don‘t mind or even feel the input lag on a projector screen.",Positive
Intel,"It's mad that even with a 4090 running games at 4k, they still look less realistic than the low-res FMV sequences in The 7th Guest from 30 years ago.",Negative
Intel,"Do keep in mind that despite both being named the same, the devil's in the details. Movies use way more rays per scene and way more bounces too.   Path tracing in CP2077 shows temporal artifacts due to denoising, something that doesn't happen in movies. It is being improved with the likes of DLSS 3.5, but it is still quite off when compared to said movies.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind the systems that rendered toy story 1, costing upwards of like 300k IIRC, have less power than your cell phone today and were super delicate/finicky machines. There's a dude on youtube that got a hold of like the second best one that was made at the time and the machine honestly was really impressive for when it came out, but it pales in comparison to even a steam deck really.",Neutral
Intel,"> Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story  Toy Story didn't use path tracing though, A Bug's Life was Pixar's first movie to use ray tracing (not path tracing) and only for a few frames in the entire movie for specific reflections, they started using ray tracing more generally for Cars and I can't find exactly when they started using path tracing but it should be around the early 2010s which is also when the other Disney animation studios started using path tracing",Neutral
Intel,No it's not a miracle. Because it's downscaled a lot and also uses lower quality math and piggybacking on AI to make up for it. It's basically running through 3 layers of cheats to produce results that aren't that much better than just traditional raster.,Negative
Intel,"That’d be some next level consumerism, paying 1500$ minimum to turn on a single setting in a single game just to play it wayyyyy slower than you would otherwise",Neutral
Intel,"Hell playing path tracing with my 2080ti at 25 FPS is still looks absolutely fantastic, I would absolutely play with pathtracing on a 4090 constantly. Idc dlss looks great with RR even at 1080p. I won’t upgrade for another year or 2 (just bought a phone so I’m broke right now)",Positive
Intel,4090 getting 60fps at 4k balanced dlss with no frame gen. 100 with frame gen. I can make it drop into the 20s if I stand right next to a fire with all the smoke and lightening effects or if I go to a heavily vegetated area it’ll drop to mid 40s. But it’s stay consistently at 55-65 and even goes Into the 90s if I head out of the city.   Haven’t tried it at quality or with dlss off though. May go do that now that it says only 19fps lol. Have to try it to see for myself,Neutral
Intel,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-dlss-35-tested-ai-powered-graphics-leaves-competitors-behind  Well it's so close (54fps) it's more like a 3080Ti or higher from 3000 series or a 4070TI + from 4000 series it seems? The old 3000 series is punching way above it weight vs the 7900xtx, which was meant to deliver similar RT performance to the 3090.. which it doesn't.",Neutral
Intel,At some point the RT pixels are so expensive that native resolution w/o DLSS and frame gen is just not gonna work for the time being.,Negative
Intel,"On the other hand, if you set the new DLSS 3.5 to performance (which you should in 4k), and just enable frame generation, you get 90+ in 4k with basically zero issues unless you pause to check frames.",Positive

Intel,"you take that back, I literally returned my 4080FE for a 4090 liquid x for more frames in cyberpunk.",Neutral
Intel,I almost see no difference.   And to see the little diffidence I need to take two screenshots and compare them.,Neutral
Intel,The game look is ruined on PT it makes everything look completely different.  Regular RT keeps the style of the game and performs good.,Negative
Intel,Dont use useless raytracing and you wont have any problems lol,Negative
Intel,"Because PC gaming blew up during a time where you could buy a mid range GPU and not need to upgrade for 5-6 years. Now those sample people buy a GPU, and 2 years later it can't run new games. At least that's my theory.",Negative

Intel,Well the 3050 managed to hold with just 8GB while the 3070Yi crashed?,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, and people insisted on defending the configurations at launch lmao. The cards just won't be able to handle heavy loads at high resolution such as this game, regardless of how fucking insane the actual processing unit is.

Intel,DLSS unironically looks better than native TAA even at 1080p in this game because of the shit ghosting.,Negative
Intel,Only people who don't give a shit about high quality graphics don't care about ray tracing.,Negative
Intel,I got a stupidly good deal on the 4090(buddy won an extra one from a company raffle) and it just so happened my XTX was one of the cards suffering from the mounting issue on release.  Honestly very happy that all of that happened. Sure I would have been happy with the 7900xtx if I got a replacement but the 4090 just kinda blew me away especially with all the DLSS tech behind it.,Positive
Intel,"Nvidia used cp77 as a testing grounds for their dlss3 and rt tech, it'd no surprise it looks and performs relatively good, they literally partnered with cdpr for that.  Do not expect these levels of RT on most games anytime soon, probably in a couple years (with rtx 5000 series) the tech will be more mature and not as taxing for most cards, because needing to upscale and use framegen to get 60fps on an RT PT setting is kinda absurd.",Negative
Intel,">only then they become great features  Watch this happen with ""fake frames"" FSR3 in real time",Negative
Intel,>Ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick   This line was already false years ago when control launched. Now it’s just absurd,Negative
Intel,"There are a lot of new games that features Ray Tracing on them as of now, too bad most of them doesn't look as visually as good as they could be though as most of the time their RT effects are dumbed down or reduced to the point it's pointless.  But the thing is that wasn't the point even from the beginning, RT Overdrive on Cyberpunk is literally considered as a Technological showcase  What matters here IMO for all of us is PC platform in general is showcasing here what a real high-end computers can achieve beyond what current gen console can do, and they are showcasing it really well here on Cyberpunk with much better visuals and using plenty of tricks to make them more than playable, where they shouldn't be considering how much demanding they are over standard, that is impressive enough to me and shows a good sign of technological engineering innovation.   As what Bryan Catanzaro said on his interview on DF Direct, work smarter not harder, brute force is not everything, of course it still matters a lot but doing it alone is starting to become pointless just like how it is on real life.",Negative
Intel,Much more fps :) Newer generation cards have at least 50-60% better raster performance then prev gen.,Positive

Intel,"So just to be clear, you don't like running games at native resolution? Because the purpose of DLSS is to improve performance by specifically not running at native resolution",Negative
Intel,Nice but ive been playing video games since the 70s and its Shit end off..,Negative
Intel,The future of frame generation is going to be huge. I can definitely see 360p frame rendering upscaled to 4k with 80% maybe even 90% of the frames being generated. All with equal to or even better visual quality.   A 20 FPS game like this will become a 100-200fps game.  We may be looking at the end of beefy graphics cards being required to play games. Just a good enough mid or low tier chip (granted 5-10 years from now) with frame generation might be enough.,Positive
Intel,"After 2.0, it's around 100""fps"". Just 60""fps"" (meaning with FG enabled) is far from being playable due to latency. You need at least 90""fps"" for playable experience.   Cyberpunk PT vs RT is a huge difference in terms of graphics, while DLSS Quality vs Balanced is really slim in comparison. What you say would be a really bad trade-off.   At 1440p DLSS Quality it's easily 120+""fps"" which is perfectly comfortable.",Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is greatly optimized. It looks fantastic for the hardware it asks. Starfield looks like game from 5 years that asks hardware from the future.,Positive

Intel,Pixar movies will sometimes take the better part of a day to render a single 4k frame on a render farm. So the fact that Cyberpunk takes more than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame in its path-tracing mode on a single 4090 clearly means that it's unoptimized garbage! /s  EDIT: Apparently people in this thread don't understand sarcasm (or don't understand how a path-traced game can take longer than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame with high-poly path tracing and still be optimized).,Negative

It may or may not make sense to maybe have a raster chiplet and a ray tracing chiplet on the same processor package on a single gpu. But, probably makes more sense to have it all on one chiplet, and just use many of the same chiplet for product segmentation purposes instead.   A separate PPU did make sense tho, I'm still annoyed that the nvidia ageia deal essentially kill the PPU in the cradle.

Intel,"They are still the same thing and should be named the same, your disclaimer is just semantics about the implementation.",Neutral
Intel,"Weird argument.  Traditional raster is cheats upon cheats upon cheats already.  In fact, all of the lighting entirely in raster is essentially cheats.",Negative
Intel,It will not work well/look good using a single frame worth of data either due to the low ray counts. Digital Foundry has shown Metro Exodus builds the lighting over ~20 frames or so and it seems like Cyberpunk is even more. Even Cyberpunk ray pathtracing doesn't look as good in motion due to that same build-up effect.  You need to cast 20-50x the rays to have enough data for a single frame but then you will be measuring the game performance by seconds per frame.,Negative
Intel,"RT looks significantly better than raster when it’s not just using simple reflections like a Far Cry 6. Raster is all cheats, the so called reflections are essentially rendering the scene or part of the scene being reflected in reverse then applying fake material effects to mimic metal, water, etc. Raster also takes HUNDREDS to thousands of person hours to get the fake reflections and lighting to look decent to good. That’s why devs love RT and want it to grow, as RT/hardware does the work for them.",Negative

Intel,It's not a perfect way of measure but you can clearly see how (at least on Nvidia GPUs) the 8/10GB cards are way behind the >11Gb cards. Meaning you need 11 or 12GB of VRAM for this scenario which cripples the 3080 but not the 3060.  We said from the start these configurations are shit but no-one listened. There you go.,Negative
Intel,The crypto miners did me a comical solid by preventing me from acquiring many countless times and hours I wasted (came from a gtx1070 before finally being able to upgrade). Was able to get my 6900xt eventually for around $600 with 2 games. Becoming increasing thankful for the extra Vram these days.   Once I start getting through my game backlog and into the gard hitting ray tracing ones will hopefully upgrade to something with at least 24gigs of GDDR# lol.,Positive

Intel,"I expect path tracing support to be the exception for a while because most developers will consider the non-trivial dev time to implement it not worth it. However, I'm sure Nvidia would be willing to throw dev help at most developers who would be willing to implement path tracing with their help.  Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090). That's substantially faster than than how fast a 4090 runs Cyberpunk on the path tracing mode. Presumably, a less complex world helps, but they may also have implemented opacity micro maps, which I'm not sure if Cyberpunk has done in the 2.0 update. Perhaps they're cherry-picked examples for the trailer.",Neutral

Intel,You can already have 120fps on $1000 PC,Neutral
Intel,It improves both looks and fps so it is a win win,Positive
Intel,"The issue with this is the inputs will only be registered at 20Hz. This would feel awful. The benefit of high FPS is having very low latency. This will just make it look smoother, not feel any better than 20 FPS",Negative
Intel,Considering there is no input on the generated frames that is going to feel horrible to play. Base FPS (incl DLSS) really still needs to be 50-60fps to feel playable imo.,Negative
Intel,I'm thinking will there ever come a day where 100% of frames are generated by AI. Like the data inputs directly from the card into the neural network and it no longer requires physical hardware limitation to generate frames.,Neutral

Intel,"The thing about ray and path tracing is that they are demanding on their own, not because they are badly optimised",Negative
Intel,"I have a 4070. It runs the game just fine with the tools that have been set in place.  This is absolutely not a pissing match. Cyberpunk is demanding, and takes advantage of lots of tech available for upscaling and ray tracing and frame generation. AMD card’s currently do not match Nvidia’s in those categories, not even close. This us not an attempt to showcase Nvidia tech, but it does take advantage of it.",Positive
Intel,Because it's not about the flagship card. Only if the flagship can attain good performance at native then you will have headroom for lower end cards. Think about it. Of course upscaling is very important. But you also need some headroom to upscale.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah. I wanted better cooling performance after upgrading to the artic freezer 7 as well with those weird crapy plastic tension clips you pushed in manually, fearing bending them (worse than the stock intel cooler tension twist lock). Kept having random stability crashes until after i sanded it down for better thermals...Good old sandpaper and nerves of steel fearing an uneven removal of the nickel coating.  Was trying to maximize performance as back then core 2 duo and the extreme versions were king and they had way higher single core clocks and were easy to oc. Wanted the multhreaded for Crysis, LoL (back when you had to wait 5min+ to get into a game), BF2, and was eventually playing TF, Day of Defeat and Natural Selection.  My upgrade back then was to the Evga 560ti DS, which I ended up installing a backplate and  a gelid cooler. They had wayy better thermal tape/individual heatsinks for the memory/vram chips for the heat transfer. Evga back then told me if I ever needed to RMA it that I would just need to re-assemble it as it was shipped. Remember using artic solver ceramique instead of as5 due to it potentially not degrading as fast as well.   Good times =)",Negative

Remember in 2011 upgrading to a gtx 570, the first gen with tessellation and playing dragon age 2 which was one of the first games to have it. Ended up turning off tessellation cause it hit the card too hard, least until I got a second 570 in sli, which sadly died like a year later due to heat while playing Shadow Warrior.",Positive

Intel,"There was more nuance to that ""bugfix"" than just ""it was a bug that got fixed""   Modders were able to re-enable the AMD/NVIDIA PhysX combo basically immediately via editing DLLs.  Not driver replacements, but actual DLL tweaks.  The speed at which modders were able to fix what NVIDIA ""broke"" combined with the public outrage put them in a funny legal spot.  If they continued with PhysX disabled and claiming it was a bug then the bug can easily be fixed, as shown by modders doing it first.  So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.  Obviously not many modern games use the GPU implementation of PhysX anymore and the performance difference between current GPU and CPU implementations are negligible anyway, but their intent at the time was clear once it was shown how quickly modders were able to get everyone back to normal.",Neutral

Intel,I like how you said: static image  because in motion upscaling is crappier,Negative
Intel,"It isn't a weird argument. Rasterization is premised on approximating reality, while RT is simulating it.  The extreme few amount of rays we trace right now, including bounces, means effects are often muted and the performance hit is enormous. To compensate, we're using temporal upscaling from super low resolutions *and* frame interpolation.  Temporal upscaling isn't without it's issues, and you know how much traditional denoisers leave to be desired. Even Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction leaves a lot to be desired; the thread on r/Nvidia shows as much, with ghosting, artifacts, etc. all over again. It's like the launch of DLSS 2.0.  All of that, for effects that are oftentimes difficult to perceive, and for utterly devastating traditional rasterization performance.",Negative
Intel,"It's a shame raster is so labor intensive, because it looks so interesting when done right.     I look at screenshots from cyberpunk, Raster / Ray Trace / Path Trace, and in most of them the raster just looks more interesting to me. Not constrained by what would be real physical lighting. The 100% RT render versions of old games like Quake gives a similar feeling.     But I imagine there will be more stylistic RT lighting over time, it saving a ton of labor is all things considered good, freeing it up for actual game design.",Positive

PT just looks and feels way more natural than just RT, when only raster literally looks like it was two different games from two different hardware generations.

Almost 70% still have 1080p.   CDPR made a VERY demanding game that looks GORGEOUS completely turned up. Modern hardware cannot handle it natively, it can’t. It is not a gimmick that a company has developed a superior technology that allows the game to be played at almost the same quality as native, significantly smoother and faster. You’re in denial if you think otherwise.  I’m not tied to either brand. I have an AMD CPU bc it was the best option for what I wanted, and a Nvidia GPU for the same reason. I care about RT, frame gen, all of that. The Witcher 3 still is my favorite game, and the entire reasoning for building a gaming PC over a console is graphical quality and speed while doing so. That game is absolutely gorgeous with RT on. Same with Cyberpunk, which I can enjoy thanks to DLSS.   You don’t care about those things? That’s fine, but it is solely a personal opinion.",Negative
Intel,"Yea well I was defining an arbitrary performance. It's not about having native performance.

The 4060ti gets 6.6 fps. Let's assume a next gen flagship is able to reach 60 fps at 4k. That would theoratically allow the 60ti card to reach around 20 fps.

Raster techniques have evolved a lot since then, and use raytracing in limited contexts, screen space reflections and ambient occlusion for example, but they're still operating with extremely limited data in narrow, isolated use cases, which is why they often look awful.

CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",Neutral

Intel,"> There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT.

Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.  Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts.

Now that Intel is working on dedicated GPUs they are going to eventually create APU like products, its just the natural outcome of producing both CPUs and GPUs.

GPU utilization is the one that is far more useful for spotting bottlenecks, general performance observations are far more useful for tweaking.  Even Intel and co. will tell you that with modern processors and all the elements they contain as well as hyperthreading/SMT CPU utilization isn't a very useful stat anymore.

Intel,"While I haven't used it daily or anything, and I've only done initial setup on the Lunar Lake, the feedback we've gotten both on Arrow Lake and for Lunar Lake (e.g. 268V and 265H) Dell models is that it's a big increase in battery life and performance. The integrated graphics (e.g. 140V and 140T) are very capable compared to a **workstation** grade NVIDIA Ada 500 GPU, but they are not even comparable to a gaming GPU like the GeForce 4060 or even a 5050.  The integrated graphics do however get used for 99% of all workloads unless explicitly specified because they are vastly more battery efficient and draw less power compared to a dedicated NVIDIA chip, meaning you can have a much smaller external power supply, and your graphics performance in those basic desktop workloads with one of these chipsets will be **much** better than previous generation Intel chips. Exceptions are obviously something like gaming or AutoCAD that specify to use the high performance dedicated graphics chip.  140V/140T are barely functional for modern AAA gaming, but if you stay 5-10 years back for AAA titles you might be okay. It will smoke most Indie games. Just look at the per title benchmarks for a 140V/140T and you can see if your game benches. You could probably get away with a lot of functional mobile gaming without a dGPU, but I wouldn't expect to be able to play a recent Call of Duty or Black Myth or anything with anything like an acceptable framerate at a decent resolution. This integrated graphics chip compares very favorably to its more common Ryzen 7 equivalent, I believe the 780M, and it's a very good APU for handhelds overall due Lunar Lake's power efficiency compared to other X86 chips.  You have to understand that for these next two generations Intel seems to be making big strides in terms of both power efficiency and integrated graphics for mobile, it's a very attractive option and the first time I've seriously considered a laptop without a dGPU. I think Panther Lake is going to be a very nice kit next year for both laptops and handhelds and give AMD a run for its money.   I suspect AMD genuinely needs a new APU graphics architecture implemented next year to keep up, which I expect them to. Not a bad problem to have.",Positive
Intel,"Yeah for sure. It's a small die and should be yielding pretty high. See also the number of 4+8+4 SKUs. Looks like the larger CPU tile is also yielding decently, so not a ton to cut down.

Even if it was 6 Xe3 cores and built as half of the larger die (just one of the two render slices)  it would fill the void a bit more.",Neutral

I understand exactly why the 4-10 gap exists, but I can't say I don't wish there was something to fill that gap if only because it looks weird.  I expect the big CPU tile and small GPU tile pairing will find its way into a number of gaming laptops as the iGPU performance is pretty low on the priority list for those.",Neutral
Intel,"PTL's main changes are fixing MTL/ARL's terrible SoC design, which should net a few % performance. It'll see a mild IPC increase, getting a few more % performance. And it'll lose a bit of clockspeed, erasing most of those gains.  Expect PTL to be very similar performance to ARL, but with lower power consumption, a much better iGPU, and most importantly to Intel: Using their own fabs instead of TSMC.  It absolutely won't be X3D in gaming.  Edit: Actually shocked that people think this would compete with X3D.  9955HX3D is \~16% faster than a 275HX in gaming...and a 275HX itself is easily 10%+ faster than a 285H in gaming.  Not even Intel themselves are claiming this. Their own marketing refers to PTL as ""ARL performance with LNL efficiency"". Nobody realistically expects PTL-H to see a 25%+ gaming improvement over ARL-H. The fact that IPC increase is less than 10% and clockspeed is slightly lower than ARL-H should make this obvious",Neutral
Intel,CGC is a LNC tick. This is well known at this point. And we see it's even a clock speed regression.    Even entertaining the notion it will close the gap to AMD's X3D chips is just delusional.,Neutral
Intel,"Oh, yeah, I get you. Wish they could give more granularity. Just personally think some sacrifices are worthwhile if it can condense Intel's mobile lineup back down to something sane again.   > I expect the big CPU tile and small GPU tile pairing will find its way into a number of gaming laptops as the iGPU performance is pretty low on the priority list for those.  Yeah, should be a good fit. Shame they don't have anything with a bit more CPU umph, though. 4+8+4 and only up to 5.1GHz is *fine*, but not great. Especially without an HX replacement.",Neutral
Intel,"Two options seems right, either you care about it or you don't.",Neutral
Intel,"Its not ""delusional"" to want to see actual numbers instead of speculation. I have been in this game long enough to see plenty of speculation even with accurate information not give the actual numbers.",Negative
Intel,"Given how well ARL HX was received in gaming laptops, I think they may wait to have something from NVL take that top spot. 5.1ghz does seem low though. ARL-H will happily do 5.4 and 18A should clock decently, though I suppose that's a sacrifice for the 25W TDP.  I suspect these may not be totally final clocks though they do seem reasonable.",Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, surprised ARL-HX is doing as ok as it is. The deficits of the architecture in gaming are well known. If it could hit the same clocks and core counts, PTL should look a lot better still. And all that besides, ARL's cost structure is horrible. For Intel's own sake, the sooner they move on, the better.   > and 18A should clock decently, though I suppose that's a sacrifice for the 25W TDP  From the same leaker, these chips are at 65W or even 80W TDPs, so they're not merely power limited. It seems that 18A just significantly underperform some expectations, though in line with some rumors and the gist of the revisions Intel's been making to its projections over the last year or two.  > I suspect these may not be totally final clocks though  If they're defining SKUs and such, these clocks need to be finalized for all practical purposes.",Negative
Intel,"If I'm reading correctly those are max power limits, not the TDP,  though I get what you mean. The 285H sits at a 45W TDP and tops out at 115W. Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  As for why ARL HX is doing well in gaming laptops, I think a good bit of that is also part of what made it lackluster on desktop. It doesn't really scale up that well with higher TDPs and power limits, but it does seem to scale down. The 285HX with its 55W TDP and 160W max limit doesn't perform far off the 125W TDP and 250W max of the 285K.  It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system. The 9955HX3D is very impressive, but quite a lot of laptop buyers seem to value the ability to do more laptop-like things with their gaming laptops than the extra frame rate. I'm hoping this gets shaken up as AMD adopts new packaging tech as seen in Strix Halo.",Neutral
Intel,"> If I'm reading correctly those are max power limits, not the TDP, though I get what you mean. The 285H sits at a 45W TDP and tops out at 115W. Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  Not guaranteed given it's just a twitter leak, but I'm assuming the leaker is using the term TDP consistently with Intel's historical usage, i.e. PL1. For ARL, 115W is PL2. I would also assume there wouldn't be the disclaimer about it being hard to cool if they cut the PL2 so much, though PowerVia does create some interesting complications there, so maybe not quite apples to apples.  Either way though, don't think it should have much impact on ST boost. You're talking a good 70%-ish of power going to compute, so even at 65W PL2, that's still 40-50W available for one core. Should be *easily* sufficient to hit whatever the silicon is capable of.  > It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system.  Yes, and this is something I've very much looking forward to with NVL-HX. At this point, the biggest demerit of the -HX platform vs -H is the use of standard DDR5 vs LPDDR. That's because it's still based on the desktop silicon with the different SoC/hub tile. But with NVL using a shared SoC die, they should be able to offer an -HX platform with the core counts people expect (though probably limited to single die 8+16), but the power/battery life advantages of -U/-P/-H. In general, should help make the -HX more of a straight-up upgrade than the tradeoffs one faces today.  AMD has this situation even worse today, because there's a much bigger gap between their desktop SoC architecture and the mobile one. Though as you say, they may also bring them closer together in the future.",Neutral

Like for like on TDP, this would be a solid improvement given the GPU both has to be moved off-tile compared to Lunar Lake, and has twice as many CPU cores to fight for power.

Intel,"e cores are surprisingly powerful now, and games are getting more multithreaded. It might be better to spread them out over 8 less power hungry cores than 4 P cores and then spill over to the slower cores. Especially in a laptop environment where efficiency matters and the GPU is usually holding back gaming performance so much that CPU performance is really not that important.  In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread. But most importantly, it doesn't do so evenly. Maybe you don't need something assigned to e cores, or the e core task is light and doesn't hold up the other threads. Then things will run at the pace of the P cores, but every now and then you'll have a slowdown.",Neutral

Gaming benchmarks tend to have a really strong feedback loop that favors last gen hardware design though.

Yeah 9950X should outperform it technically I guess but the split L3 between two CCDs probably holds back the advantage of having more cores.  Yeah sadly there's no benchmark for Bannerlord.

Going from 7950X to to 7700X results in 5 FPS loss, which is like 2-3% less FPS, and it's mostly because of lower clock speed(5.7Ghz Vs 5.4Ghz boost).   >but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.  That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.  Edit: typo",Positive
Intel,"Well you said that games are optimized for 8/16 and yet gn bench shows 7600X only gets 3-4 less avg fps than 7700X in baldurs gate 3, a highly multithreaded game, it has better 0.1% lows even, though I'm sure that one is a contained incident since BG3 is very dynamic and hence results are not always repeatable. Same with Starfield.   That's because in video games, core count matters less than how fast the CPU can access or manipulate very dynamic types of data in a random memory address.    X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"". They're going to win in old or new games, and they're winning in games because they have a large buffer of low latency data. Not winning in productivity benchmarks because productivity is about processing matters more than accessing data, and its more easily multithreaded too in many cases.    But having more cores is still more advantageous in software and games that can occupy them.",Neutral
Intel,">Well you said that games are optimized for 8/16 and yet gn bench shows 7600X only gets 3-4 less avg fps than 7700X  I said ""can and will"" not that every game is going to benefit from it.  Point of discussion was to prove that games are using more than 16 threads or they're not - it seems like you overestimated Starfield, UE5 reliance on core count/threads and most games care about 16 threads at most.   >core count matters less  Yes, that's why I replied to that person and asked him to provide me with modern AAA games which are more ""multi-threaded"" now than AAA games a few years ago, I feel like what he ""observes"" is what he wants to believe, and not something that actually happened with optimization in games.  >X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"".  AMD sells 9950X3D, best productivity and gaming CPU, if you really need both(workloads/gaming) it's the optimal way, for an average user, only benefit of E-cores is lower power draw when idle - but they do matter more if you need those workloads, I agree, but we discussed gaming performance and core reliance.",Neutral

Intel,"For them to do a 'big iGPU' design they would need to do a few things:  1. Use a different socket.  The iGPU will get too big for the existing one.  2. Upgrade the memory bus to 256bit.  That uses some power and silicon.  3. Add cache to the chip for the iGPU to use (to make up for the poor bandwidth they get from LPDDR5, even with a wider bus)  If they don't do this then the chip (which again won't fit in their default socket) will be massively bandwidth constrained to the degree that it's pointless.  Basically, do all the stuff that Strix Halo did.  Issue is Strix Halo didn't sell very well, the idea is a proof of concept and the concept needs faster memory to really work well.  LPDDR6 might help a lot at getting these big chip ideas from a XX60 level to a XX70 level, but they still require a lot of expensive chip work and a new motherboard design custom to the big socket.

Intel,"Indeed and it is something very interesting, because the reason the driver overhead is an issue on 6 core cpu's is because modern games use all 6 cores, so if the driver has a big overhead the CPU has nu free cores available for the driver.

I would expect an i5-12400 to suffer the same as a Ryzen 5 5600,  But an i5-13400/14400 has an additional 4-e cores to deal with the overhead. The 13500/14600 even has 8 e cores.

Like even one game if intel/amd gave about the same performance you could likely rule it out somewhat.  Also weird to say they fixed it if by the sounds of it to say it's fixed if a very limited number of games were updated to work better in also seemingly limited scenarios.

AMD,"Depends on price. Word on the street is that AMD gave Valve a reaaally good deal on 7600 dies.   Essentially it appears that AMD produced way too many Navi 33 dies, using an older node (6nm) to make them cheaper and more plentiful, expecting to put a lot of them in laptops. Apparently, OEMs preferred the more expensive (and more efficient) 4060 instead, and that left AMD with lots of Navi33 (RX 7600) dies on their hands.  Talking to AMD Valve probably saw an opportunity to take this excess capacity for cheap, and AMD saw an opportunity to recoup some cost, rather than risk throwing them away. I can imagine Valve getting those RX 7600 cards for maybe half the price of what a 9060XT would be (depending on memory prices).",Neutral

If Valve can release something that can compete with these consoles, at a similar price, with a similar feature set, but with also all the advantages of being a computer, then it's definitely worth it. Going from $1000 to $700 will open a huge market for Valve. Going to $600 would be the nail in the coffin for Xbox.   No online fees, lower game prices, your game library will never expire, infinite game catalogue, and you can use it as your main PC as well, for the same price as a normal console...

AMD,Valve isn’t buying individual components at retail price.,Neutral
AMD,More and more games demand RT and even software RT is vram heavy. Doom the dark ages can run much better on the 7600xt compared to its 8gb version even though they're the same card with only mild clock differences,Neutral

AMD,"Plus, much easier to integrate into a smaller form factor than shrinking down a desktop GPU. The Steam machine is basically a screen-less laptop hosting a Ryzen 7640 (without iGPU) plus an RX 7600M, but with a huge-ass heatsink and fan to properly allow for higher clocks.",Positive
AMD,It's honestly hilarious. AMD will have zero FSR4 compatible mobile product at all until 2027 without hacky aftermarket solutions. Mind you laptop sales began to outpace desktop about two decades ago.,Negative
AMD,"Except it's not even a desktop 7600, it's a mobile 7600m. Another 4CU cut.",Negative
AMD,"I think this thing makes no sense at all.  Especially since you re not just buying a new low end gpu to put into an old pc for cheap to give it some new life.  No , you re buying cpu, gpu, ram, ssd, mobo, case, power supply  Thats a ton of money.  And the performance wont justify the price at all.",Negative
AMD,"The 4k claim is really weird. On old games, sure. But am 8GB 7600 is a 1080p GPU, which isn't even that bad on a TV, especially since upscaling 1080p content is kind of a TV's bread and butter",Negative
AMD,"Cool, but individual components involve free assembly by you, steam machine needs assembling and to make money.",Neutral
AMD,"Slapping the chip from the RX 9060/XT onto a laptop style motherboard would not be technically any more difficult than using the 7600M chip. The 7600M is itself just a slightly cutdown, underclocked desktop RX 7600 chip.  Both chips are physically pretty much the same size (200 mm2 give or take a few) and the desktop versions have very similar power usage.   The only reason to use the RX 7600 over the RX 9060 chip in this application is cost.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah he mentioned that... result will be worse. 4K60 is going to be a very limited thing, marketing beware etc but I hope people are prepared for a little/lot of choppiness.",Negative
AMD,"Because of frame gen and upscaling, they can say it’s any output resolution any output frame rate and it’s technically not lying. It’s a useless piece of info without details.",Negative
AMD,"The steam machine doesn’t need to make money. The steam machine needs to get people to play PC games, which steam has an effective monopoly on. If Valve sells the steam machine at cost they’ll make money.",Neutral
AMD,"I agree, but it's still more work than just slapping the existing laptop board that's already engineered with the proper footprint, connections, inputs and outputs in there, because AFAIK there's no RDNA4 laptop parts at all and the most we have are the RDNA3.5 GPU in the PS5 Pro and the AI APUs",Neutral
AMD,Any corporate mention of resolution and framerate is completely meaningless now because it only refers the output. It could be achieved by upscaling from 540p and with 4x frame gen (amd doesn't use it atm) and it still wouldn't be technically lying.,Negative
AMD,Frame gen and upscaling can't solve a lack of VRAM in many games either though (frame gen makes it even worse). Unless they're talking about FSR1 lol,Negative

AMD,AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 391 and a half.,Neutral
AMD,"Excited about the 388 i would love an 8/16 cpu for lighter things like gaming and general computing with the 8060, right now you basically have to pay for 64-128gb ai machines and not everyone wants that",Positive
AMD,I'm just hoping this leads to a mini PC with this chip in it so I can replace my ancient gaming desktop with an all in one machine. The current Strix Halo line is everything I've ever wanted in an all-in-one machine but is too overkill and expensive for what it's worth. A cut down variant with the same iGPU would be sweet.,Positive

I doubt that we'll see these in a mass market ASUS, Lenovo, or MSI handheld unless we get a ""Z"" series version of Strix Halo. I am anticipating something like a ""Z2 Ultimate"" if AMD stockpiles enough yields with defective+disabled NPUs or something. Maybe there will be yields that are only stable up to 45w with reduced clocks that can find a home in more conventional handheld designs. The Phawx has proven that any TDP over 25W will offer massive gains over the existing Z2E.",Positive
AMD,"Not sure about handhelds. I think these processors are intended for NUCs, so maybe they don't work very well with a battery. Perhaps for a ""Steam Console""? I'm not sure either. I'd like to see someone putting Bazzite in one of those chips and plug it to a 4K TV, see if it's any good.",Negative

Gaming performance for 8060s - it’s much better than I expected. About every modern fighting game runs in 4k at stable 60, though upscaling is usually required for that. It also megabonks perfectly.   So I have high hopes for these new chips, given that they use the exact gpus. It now all boils to price and form factors.   My gt9 is undervolted and slightly overclocked, and runs at about sustained 140 watts.   Given that I live in Ukraine and lately experience blackouts, so during those I put it on balanced profile (sustained 80watts) and run off ecoflow together with monitor (instead of tv when life is gucci). This balanced setup all together is consuming around 137 watts when megabonking at 4k.",Positive

The main thing is that I want a sub 2kg laptop with dedicated GPU and 32GB RAM, so the main laptops I'm eyeing rn are either:  * 2023 ROG Zephyrus G14 * 2024 HP Omen Transcend 14  but their new RTX 4060 versions are still hovering around 1300 USD in my country, way above my budget.  So ofc I'm hoping that their price substantially goes down either during Black Friday or 12/12 sale, but do you think that they're even still worth pursuing or should I just focus on 2025 & upcoming laptops? (My third pick that fits my requirements is the new Legion 5, but that one's even more expensive atm)  Also technically there are three used laptop stores trying to sell a used RTX 4070 Omens to me at 1300 USD, but no way used stores are going to give any substantial Black Friday discounts",Neutral
AMD,#1 usecase for these in AI is running medium sized MoE models for local LLMs.  And for that they offer a pretty compelling solution. You basically have to spend twice as much to do it with Apple. At which point you're not using CUDA either.  ROCm works and inference engines like llama.cpp also support Vulkan compute AI.  It's basically the most power efficient and most cost efficient solution on the market for local LLMs.,Positive
AMD,"Well, mobile ai, these things don’t use sodim ram (or ram sticks in general) and the speeds of ddr5x aren’t used for most CPU’s. This very well could be also targeting mobile ai ( specifically more ai/gaming where the 395+ was targeting development and simulations as well). Also ai doesn’t need cuda, rocm exists and it’s quite good, any downfalls of amd is on a architectural level, but if you’re doing local ai on the go then you don’t really need cuda if that makes sense.",Neutral

The *only* advantage this would have over the ""full fat"" die is cost. And that still depends on yields and how much supply of these binned dies they actually get.",Neutral

AMD,"Another answer nobody's touched on yet is the price/sales curve in basic economics. There's optimal intersection points and sometimes with a moderate price increase, you'll get drastically fewer sales. But there's some customers that are not as price sensitive, so bumping it 50 won't lose that group.   Hopefully that makes sense.",Neutral
AMD,Money. Corporations are evil and not your friends,Neutral
AMD,"Companies are valued based on their gross and operating margins. If their costs rise, they also have to increase their sale prices by the same percentage, or those margin rates go down, which reduces the valuation of the company. Distribution and retailer also take a percentage of the product value as their margin. So even if the oem only raises the product price by the higher costs, retailers still increase the price based on the percentage increase.",Neutral
AMD,">Why does Asus, Gigabyte, etc, get to make $30 more profit when they spend $20 on memory?  Why not?  They operate based on profit margins.  If they're earning a 50% profit margin, then a $20 increase in input costs will result in $30 increase to the selling price.  Plus, just because NAND contracts went up by $X doesn't mean that's what it costs manufacturers, because they're still bidding against each other for actual supply.  If they don't wanna sit there with 0 stock for the next 6 months, they'll need to bid up the price even higher.",Negative
AMD,They have a legal obligation to make as much money as possible. Gamers have shown since the crypto eras and onward that we’ll pay more for hardware than they thought possible. I just saw a whole thread from someone who bought a 5090 to game casually on non-graphically intense titles and do office work. We’ve signaled to these hardware companies that PC gaming is a luxury.,Neutral
AMD,"The same reason Intel's Lunar Lake was a one-off.  Companies run a percentage profit margin they report to their investors. If they produce a good that costs 50$ to make, and sell it for 100$, then they have a profit margin of 50%. For investors this means that every dollar they put into production results in 2 dollars of capital, which is a good indicator for potential growth, and, of course, potential dividend payout.  If costs increase by 10$, then, if price were left unchanged, their profit margin would sink to 40%. if They increase their price by 10$ as well their profit margin would sink to ~55%. Investors will look at those numbers and conclude that the company is doing poorly: it is no longer able to achieve the same return on investment that it did previously, and they might just conclude that their money can be better spent elsewhere and cancel further investments.  So, a 10$ cost increase results in a 20$ price hike. In reality, profit margins aren't really that high for third-parties like Asus and others, investors can be persuaded that the costs aren't due to mismanagement and companies will take a hit in profitability in the short-run to maintain marketshare (although, again, AIB companies generally run razor-thin profit margins).  Another reason for adding margin to price-hikes is Machiavellian psychology: Gigabyte and others know the way the wind is blowing, RAM prices are going to keep climbing for the foreseeable future and people respond worse to smaller price increases every month than a big price increase every 6 months. So they'll add some padding now, 'worst' case they can drop the price later or give greater discounts during sales, best case they're better insulated from any future inflation.",Neutral
AMD,Because you'll pay for it anyway,Neutral
AMD,They don't. The OEMs buy kits that contain both the GPU die and the memory. AMD charges the OEM a margin on top of the kit cost. AMD and Nvidia typically don't change the margin target when the BOM increases because they typically don't need to do so to meet sales targets.,Neutral
AMD,"Because they have to maintain profit margins. They aren’t going to take a hit to margin just cause the materials got more expensive.  If you only raise the retail price by the same amount of the cost of building the card increase, then your profit margin decreases.",Neutral
AMD,"Input costs only determine the viable price floor.  The market (buyers) determine the price. They can all increase prices $50 because people will buy it. They’re also now making more profit per unit which nearly always offsets the loss of customers.  Imagine their costs are $80 and they sell for $120, that’s a $40 profit and a 50% return. Costs increase $20 to $100, price goes up $50 to $170, and all of a sudden returns are 70%, and profit per unit has almost doubled. They can sell almost half as many units and be behind in revenue but ahead in profits, which is the most important part.",Neutral
AMD,Because that’s how margins work.  It’s not sold directly from the manufacturer.,Neutral
AMD,"As the other responders have stated, it's to maintain percentage based margin. This was covered by a recent HWU video on this exact topic, where they explained that the memory usually comes in a bundle deal with the core from Nvidia/AMD. So Nvidia/AMD are creating the lion's share of the increase here. I think board partners are already squeezed pretty tight, especially by Nvidia.",Neutral
AMD,"When prices go up, demand goes down, so they're going to sell fewer units. They need to increase price more than their increase in cost to make up for the lost volume.  This is a fairly straightforward optimization problem. Total profit = per unit profit \* volume. There's also a tradeoff between per unit profit and volume: The higher the per unit profit (and therefore sale price) the lower the volume, and vice versa. When per unit profit is zero then total profit is zero, and likewise when volume is zero total profit is also zero. Somewhere between those two extremes there's a point of maximum total profit. Because per unit profit is price - cost, a change is cost is going to have a relatively larger effect on per unit profits, possibly even putting it negative without a price change. This will cause the optimal price point to move towards higher per unit profit, lower volume. This is what causes the price to go even higher than just the increase in cost.  Thinking of it as greed isn't helpful. This is a very straightforward logical deduction. They don't need increased costs to be an ""excuse"" to raise prices, they can do that anyway and they were already doing their best to optimize their price for maximum profits before.",Negative

Suddenly it's a shit deal.   If nVidia made a fixed profit per card, you'd never see anything above a 5050.

Another important thing: it means that if you can spend the additional 10 billion on something with a profit margin of 6%, you should cut production in half and do the other investment instead.       Let's consider time instead of cost.    Let's say you build wooden tables. You get paid 200€ in labour.

AMD,"I'm not sure I like that table analogy. To me it's like you're building a table for 8 hours and getting $200 in labour and praying $100 in wood, tools, etc. you'd probably charge $300 for the table. $100+$200.  33.3% is your cost in parts, and 66.6% is your profit margins that is also your hourly pay in a way.   Now imagine your parts cost went up by $100 to $200. Do you now charge $200+$200? (You pass the cost onto the consumer) Or do you charge $200 for parts/supplies plus ANOTHER $400 for the labour, because you think the 100% increase parts/supplies cost also justifies you getting a 100% hourly wage increase. After all, you want to maintain the same 66.6% margin. $200-$400.   I think in a small business like this, that would be insane to demand you get double the annual revenue and profit margin in salary. If I went from 66k a year annual net income to 133k, because my supplies cost went from 33k to 66k, that would be weird. Now admittedly, you'd sell a lot fewer tables, so you'd probably not hit those yearly goals. But in part that's your own fault for doubling your table sale price.   The second you have investors, it's suddenly justifiable though. Which to me makes the system look broken.  Personally I think what's going on is that that WANT to sell less gaming GPUs. Just like in the example above you might want to sell fewer tables. AMD is filtering their RDNA4 supply to server instead I'd guess.",Negative
AMD,"But at the quarterly reports they do report other numbers.   ""Third quarter revenue was a record $9.2 billion, gross margin was 52%, operating income was $1.3 billion, net income was $1.2 billion""  I believe by maintaining that gross margin of 52%, all those other numbers will go way up, as a result of more cost, while maintaining margin.",Neutral

Ray Regen was the new thing previewed in COD so far. We have yet to see FSR4 Frame Gen or whatever the ML-based solution will be or how their radiance caching implementation will differ from Nvidia's.",Neutral

Unlike Transformer DLSS upscaling the RR Transformer model is very punishing on Turing and Ampere but runs very well on Ada and Blackwell.",Positive
AMD,Some other features are more relevant than ray reconstruction as RT is so rarely used even on more powerful nvidia cards due to how extremely taxing it is.

AMD,"Fewer memory sales to consumers due to insane prices equals fewer motherboards being sold is something I can understand.

AMD,"Well the silver lining is Oracle's share value has been taking a beating because apparently having almost no free cash flow from high debt load and over 500% debt-to-equity ratio, and then exploding that ratio with a new round of +$30 billion of bonds to finance AI datacenter construction, is finally making AI fans worried.  Also Oracle is assuming OpenAI will be able to hold up their end of the deal to have the future cash flow to pay off the debts. Because if/when OpenAI collapses, then Oracle may actually face debt default risk.  In my personal opinion, Oracle should have built an AI specifically for enforcing their draconian and confusing terms of service to milk their customers with greater efficiency. Instead of having lawyers shakedown their ~~victims~~ customers for accidentally signing up for an extra software service, just have an AI send the nasty letters.",Negative
AMD,I see no reason not to cut consumer CPU production at some point. It's not going to make sense to buy new consumer hardware for some time.,Negative

AMD,Are you?,Neutral
AMD,They aren't cutting back in their overall production capacity.,Neutral
AMD,"Bro have you heard of this thing called 'A.I.'? It stands for artificial intelligence, and companies worth trillions of dollars are pouring their entire ecosystems into it.

AMD,"Daniel Owens on YouTube just did [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCOcWBEs4I) analyzing this. He goes over a number of points. (Which I agree with)  This is probably as optimal time as any (for the foreseeable future). Board prices are likely going up, due to RAM pricing (touched on in the video regarding [AMD rumors](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1p0h67y/amd_reportedly_planning_gpu_price_increase_as/)). While the rumored Super series are also rumored to be cancelled due to RAM situation, meaning no new models to push down prices on older supplies. With OEMs depleting supply of current stuff for the foreseeable future.  I would point out I've already seen prices creeping up as bit.

AMD,"I will remain optimistic on Zen 6... AM5 is a well-established platform and there will be no shortage of people looking to upgrade older chips by next year, that won't need to buy boards or memory to do it. I got a 7700X when it launched three years ago and really need an IPC & X3D upgrade.  On the other hand Intel owners are going to be royally screwed, none of their platforms will see another generation and neither socket 1700 nor 1851 boards are worth updating anymore. Especially as buying used Raptor Lake CPUs to upgrade on the cheap is just begging to get a damaged processor.",Positive
AMD,You think prices will be back to normal in a year? Recent reports say 2026 will be even worse for dram pricing.,Negative
AMD,"Yeah, it will arrive next week, and I will have 50 days return right, enough until CES 2026 ends to see if the supers are gonna delay or not. If they delay I will keep it and wait for 6000s if not I return and buy the supers.",Neutral

AMD,It's the most recent leak and makes a lot of sense. 3gb vram modules they wanted to use are still hard to get   Of course the new generation will be delayed at this rate too. It's not a problem for Nvidia to delay any gaming GPU. They have no competition anyway,Negative

But what really kills the 9500f is the price of the Ryzen 5 9600x, which is currently hovering around 219€ at Proshop and other retailers using the same 25,5% VAT. So yeah, even when available from local stores, not worth it at current prices. The 7500f/7600x or even the 9600x are better options.",Neutral
AMD,"The 7500f has remained an absolutely awesome buy for me with a 1440p system but it all comes down to pricing.  In the summer of 2024 I paid just above 100€ for it here in my local market. While that's not a price that was available often, 125-135€ was a pretty normal price for the CPU.  With a CPU as cheap as this, my PC remains almost exclusively GPU limited at 1440p alongside a RTX 5070. So it's understandable why so many of Steve's viewers were interested in the part. The 7500f was awesome for the money.  That being said, AMD has so many processors with video output available above the 7500f's price point that the 9500f becomes a tougher proposition considering the miniscule performance uplift.",Positive
AMD,"I said it before, So I say it again. There will never be a chip like newly launched 7500f at 115 pounds at aliexpress ever again this platform. It was to buy into the am5 family and make the transition less painful for low budget builds. Now the deal market has matured. You can find ryzen 7700s cheaper than this new 9500f  When 7500f was avaible through aliexpress or in some eastern retailers shipping worldwide, people were in denial the deal they were getting.  ""Surely 130 dollars for a chip performing the same as ryzen 7600 is too good to be true with some asterisks, right?""",Neutral

AMD,"The 8400G (6 core zen4)can be bought for $80 from aliexpress. I think its a tiny bit slower than 7500f. sounds like the perfect cheap cpu. you can even get it paired with obscure chinese $65 b650 boards that are probably ""good enough"".",Positive
AMD,The return of Zen5%?,Neutral
AMD,"I wouldn't say that that is a ""real"" price it will be, more so it hasn't really launched yet.  Like it's one retailer listing it with no images, very basic description and not in stock(though available to order 6-9 days apparently) with and the mentions of being ""oem cpu"". So I'd guess in X months if/when it has actual availability, it'll be the ""correct"" price of slightly cheaper than a 9600x is.",Neutral
AMD,"Or, ya know, older gen CPU's simply get discounted to sell quickly.    I've also seen the 9600 go for like £130-140 plenty on AliExpress.    There are still loads of crazy deals for CPU's on AliExpress if you're paying attention.",Neutral

AMD,What about AliExpress,Neutral
AMD,"You're thinking of the 8400f and no it's not a good CPU. It's also not $80 anymore if you live in the USA.  The big problem with the 8400f is it lacks Pci-E lanes, it only has 4 Pci-E 4.0 lanes for the GPU. Basically will bottleneck any modern GPU.   Then, it only has half the cache which is not ideal for gaming performance. Really not worth buying the 8400f for gaming at any price.",Negative
AMD,"Fair enough point, the price will likely come down if it properly launches. Right now though, no point in buying it.",Neutral
AMD,"I originally thought so as well.   But 9800X3D really proves that wrong.  It seems to demonstrate that the new super wide Zen 5 cores really need to be fed better or else most of their advantage will go to waste.  A huge L3 cache seems to be a good answer for this, but I'm hoping this means AMD has some good low hanging fruit to take better advantage of these super wide cores with Zen 6 that doesn't simply require the brute forcing of a massive L3.",Negative
AMD,"There are leaks of ""next gen be great"" for AMD for every single generation out there. Someones really sniffing on hopium at AMD.",Positive
AMD,Sure but Zen 6 is getting a die big ass shrink going from N5 family to N2. Zen 6 is also increasing core count by 50%.   No matter what Zen 6 will be a bigger deal than even Zen 4 let alone 5 just due to core count increase alone.,Neutral

AMD,8400f is celeron of AM5 series.,Neutral
AMD,"I think the 9800x3d just appears that way because it has the advantage of having a higher boost clock vs Zen 4X3D, due to the changes to how they structured the 3D V-cache, rather than the Zen 5 arch scaling better.   Techspot has an 11% perf gap between the 9800x3d vs the 7800x3d, while esentially no perf gap between the 9700x vs the 7700x, but his 9800x3d had an \~8% faster all core frequency vs the 7800x3d, while the 9700x had more than a 5% *lower* boost clock than the 7700x.",Neutral

AMD,I think Zen 5X3D shows us there's quite a lot of potential with Zen 5.  It was a pretty huge architectural overhaul.  So my hope is that Zen 6 helps optimize the wider architecture and brings out that potential without necessarily needing to just add a shit ton of L3 cache.  Going from a 5nm family process to 2nm is also a really big jump.,Positive

AMD,"Not at all.  It is fairly trivial to double core counts if you don't need more ST performance.   With lower clock targets and different libraries a core optimized for silicon density and power vs single thread performance will easily be 1/3 the die space.  Intel newer E cores are a bit over half the size of AMD's \`c\` cores on similar nodes and not far behind in ST performance while being more power efficient at medium clock speeds.

AMD,"(Peak) Multi-thread performance is not necessarily the right way to look at the addition of more cores. Software support is just not mature enough with most approach still just trying to parallelize one task even well beyond reasonable scaling, making large core counts seem useless.  Once core counts where naive scaling approaches break too often become common, we'll start to see a shift revealing more benefits of having a lot of cores. Task preemption which was the foundation of modern complex systems may be eventually demoted to a last resort solution for keeping misbehaving processes in line.  Spreading processes to different cores generally reduces the peak performance requirement, so cores can be operated at a lower frequency, with lower voltage greatly increasing efficiency.  Tasks sticking to specific cores without getting preempted and moved around also increases efficiency, and reduces the occurrence and impact of worst case latency penalties.  Software is just way too behind hardware, but throwing faster hardware at the problem still works, so problems are not getting fixed. For example it's amusing to see that single CCD AMD CPUs are the most common for gaming, not because they are good enough, but because dual CCD CPUs just perform worse for the average gamer.  A Linux gaming setup with a container and/or Wine limited to a single CCD with the other CCD being used for the rest of the system is the superior approach to Windows bloatware services and background processes competing with the game for the resources of the same CCD, but the later is what's the easiest to setup/get for most users, so that's what they will plan builds for.  A lot of games also just spawn one software thread per hardware thread per thread manager, which stops reasonably scaling after a point. It may be worthy to even attempt to lie about having only 8 hardware threads, then spread around the mess on 8 cores with SMT more efficiently handling the overcommitment.  Browser loads may not be even worthy of a lot of analysis. Website design regressed to the point where latency hiding is intentionally prevented, and an incredible amount of bloatware logic is expected to be processed serially.",Negative

It's part of the reason X3D was so good Zen 5 too: it can bypass the memory constraints for longer due to bigger cache. In heavy RT loads tho even the 9800x3D gets pummeled due to the infinity fabric constraints (see: Outer Worlds 2) once the cache fills your memory gets thrashed and FPS goes to toilet.   If they can get the new sweet spot with infinity fabric to, say, 8000 MT/s then even with Zen 5 cores in the thing you'd see pretty big perf gains just by that alone. It's why Zen 5 was huge for data center who can run up the score with shit like 12 channel RAM to get around bandwidth constraints a lot easier.",Neutral

For many cloud use cases, this is a good trade-off in exchange for essentially lower cost per CPU core; I'd say somewhere between 2/3 and 3/4 of general purpose cloud use cases are not performance sensitive enough to need full P cores or those with high clocks/more L3/more ST performance.

AMD,"There's a performance benefit to keeping everything else away from the CCD occupied by the game. There aren't a whole lot of people remaining who close everything else anymore when starting a game, and starting from (late?) Windows 10, it's even hard to get rid of a lot of unnecessary background tasks.  It's a bit hard to judge objectively though, because Windows doesn't have containers necessary for proper testing, and Linux is already often faster even without scheduling changes, so it's not feasible to compare the two platforms. A Linux test with one CCD disabled, then both enabled but the game constrained to one CCD could be interesting, but then Linux on its own isn't heavy in the background, so the test would be greatly affected by the choice of extra programs running, where heavy hitters like Discord would start favoring the 2 CCD setup significantly.  I'm not out of touch with more budget conscious people, but if it wasn't obvious, I wanted to point out that even the people who typically spend a lot more of minimal or only perceived benefit go with a single CCD this time, because on their setup (typical Windows gaming), 2 CCDs actually result in worse performance.  It's on software even to the point of Intel attempting to help the industry with best practices: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/optimizing-threading-for-gaming-performance.html (although this one gets more specific to their architecture, even if it still mentions concurrency limitations).  We are talking about the same scaling issue. A specific workload may scale reasonably up to 6 cores (and even that's 1-2 cores for more specialized work), a lot of code still just looks for the number of hardware threads, and creates the same number of software threads to be used in a thread pool specific to a layer, so in total the whole program will typically have more than 2-3x software threads than hardware threads available. This way you can even end up with more cores resulting in worse performance, even though they could be used to tend to the excessive number of software threads with less preemption, and therefore higher performance.",Neutral

If you want to limit it to newly added AI specific stuff, I think I'd have a harder time (because the precision is so low it's not useful for physics), but that's just low-precision support - the multiplication runs in the *exact same SIMD execution units*.  Aside from Apple's SME/AMX, current CPUs have no actual ""AI matrix engines"" anyway, just very beefy SIMD units with low-precision multiplication support, and those beefy units are *exactly* what makes the linked code run fast.",Neutral

A lot of this has to do with platform limitations, not the DRAM chips themselves. Hynix was better back in the day if you tuned it properly, *because back then you could tune it properly*. Samsung GDDR became king when you could no longer mess with voltages and straps. Tends to scale with temps compared to Hynix, so you can play with temperatures to get better results.

For servers performance per watt matters, but for things like offices you might deploy 30k units. People work maybe up to 8hrs a day, and that’s assuming their entire day is actually at a computer. Most people still work 5 day work weeks though 6 is becoming more common in corporate America.  That’s a ton of idle power consumption, and a lot of excess heat HVAC’s spend time pumping out of the building.  Intels prices on low end computers is also really low.  So there’s no value to pushing AMD hardware in these places when it costs more per desktop and more to operate.  Hopefully AMD works on their idle power consumption in the future.  I love my AMD AM5 desktop but when building a home server I couldn’t justify an extra 15-20W power consumption, especially when energy prices are going up, and IMHO will keep climbing for a while.

This chips can run Windows 11 just fine for a everyday usage (browser, some apps, Office…) but they excel as NAS, homelab servers… where they shine given their TDP, performance and QSV  I understand why AMD isn’t interested in competing in this “low TDP low profile” category, and it’s because the margin is very low and they can’t justify fill TSMC or GlobalFoundries nodes with this kind of chips orders.  Even Intel can’t, and that’s why they only make them with their own capacity (N100s aren’t produced externally) and that means they are now in a slow path of upgrade until Intel internal nodes update (meantime, Intel is ordering TSMC some of their higher end processors parts)  I would love AMD being able to compete and make something like a low TDP x4-x6-x8 APU for like 50-70$ the CPU (more than that would be out of market compared to N100s)",Neutral

It doesn’t have anything “new”.  And that’s logical. As I explained, this CPUs have a very thin economic margin, so they must use internal capacity of their nodes. And they still haven’t upgraded them since the N100 introduction. Also, the making of new e-Cores (again, given they won’t invest a lot on them given the margins) isn’t coming before 2026-2027 as earliest.  2) The N100 family runs correctly. Heck, I’m using in a desktop a N6005 (with Fedora I must say) no problem, playing 2K YouTube videos, sometimes +30 tabs, and mild multitasking (browser + another browser + Libreoffice)  I don’t know how your experience is even possible, 4 cores at 100% opening browser? Slow? It isn’t certainly the usual experience even if using Win11  I would say something else is at play, like low RAM availability (4-8GB?), slow SSD, bloated Windows or something else.  You can see benchmarks, the N100 is about the same performance as an Intel i5 8250U, and I know people even using that at their workplace no problem. Something is up with your PC, not the CPU.  In any case, I recommend you running Linux with this low resources things and avoid Windows 11 bloat.  3) That AMD you link has worse iGPU depending what you do (Intel QSV for encoding/decoding is miles ahead of AMD), and anyway, its GPU isn’t really a factor given at this performances you won’t be gaming precisely.  Also, it will run hotter and have a TDP about x2-x3 of the Intel. So I think now we’re not talking about apples to apples, but apples to oranges.  I have a Intel Nxxx that even runs passively cooled without problem, no fans, no noise, and it does its job perfectly, for about 150$. But if you are OK paying around 25-40% extra (+75-100$), more TDP, fans and so on, then yeah, you can go with a AMD Ryzen 5 APU  And if you’re OK with adding a bit more, you can even go with an Apple Mini using a M4",Neutral
AMD,"A legitimate point, but it does mean that there's substantial flexibility. AMD's content to slowly increase their market share while reaping pretty fat margins overall, but if they had an incentive to really push for more volume, they could get it.   Worth noting that Intel's TSMC wafer allocation is almost as large as AMD's, last I heard. At one point, even expected to be maybe the 3rd largest, iirc. So TSMC was able to absorb a pretty substantial amount of volume when Intel came on as a customer. Just demonstrates that the flexibility does exist.",Positive

AMD,"No offense, but your comment is basically a very long winded way of saying ""yeah it sucks"".  Linux is more efficient. But I use Windows, and I should have clarified this, but my experience with the N150 is after de-bloating and optimizing.  But sure, the AMD chip will use more power when it needs it. But that's the whole point, it HAS the power when it needs it. When it doesn't, it's pretty frugal with its power usage as well.  I'm not a fan of ""just barely enough power"" when it comes to PC components. I despise e-waste, so yeah, you might find a purpose where the N100/N150 is just barely good enough, but when your needs change, or when things become more demanding, it's for the trash. That's why I don't get ""barely fast enough"" components any more. You're getting frustrated in the short term, and creating unnecessary e-waste in the long term.

And in that case, in any case, you're better off with a CPU that CAN deliver more, rather than one that can't.  I usually shop Mini PC's on places like Ali-express, the price difference is more like $50, all else being equal.

AMD,"Ya know the more i think about this the more pissed off I guess.  PC gaming has become increasingly unaffordable in recent years. I'm one of those old school ""60"" buyers. ya know, $200-300 for a GPU, and I plan to use it for around 4-6 years.   Since around 2018, we've been getting squeezed. First it was ray tracing and all that AI upscaling crap. Nvidia decided to make the 2060 $350 and threw anyone under that under the bus. Yeah, the 16 series existed, but let's face it, those cards aged like milk too.   Then COVID happened, the price inflation happened, and I was stuck on a 1060 through the pandemic. It lasted me well, but I knew it was aging, and quite frankly, GPU manufacturers stopped giving a crap about us. THey gave us the 3060 for $330, which was a joke. And this was before the ""inflation"" all the yuppie tech bros on these subs use to justify ridiculous prices.   I managed to hold it together through COVID, and upgraded during the price crash in 2022-2023. AMD was hit first, the RX 6600 type cards could double my 1060's performance for under $300, while Nvidia was STILL charging $340 for the 3060. It was a joke. Nvidia didn't get it, I dodn't wanna pay over $300 for a fricking GPU so I bought a 6650 XT for $230. It was an amazing deal at the time.  When the 7000 series launched around then, and the rest of the series was rolled out into 2023, honestly, it offered a very poor value for the most part. RDNA2 cards were literally sold next to RDNA3 ones for most of RDNA3's lifespan. And quite frankly, there was often little reason to buyt RDNA3, it was more expensive, and offered little in price/performance over RDNA2.  RDNA2 was eventually phased out in the higher price classes, but for a while, the RX 6800 was sold along side the 7700 XT, the 6650 XT was sold next to the 7600, the 6700 XT/6750 XT were in their own niche that AMD never really replaced, and the 6600 remained supreme as the ultimate budget option, competing with the fricking RTX 3050 and thrashing it in value.  heck, I was recommending RX 6600s as recently as this year, and really only stopped when we FINALLY saw the market move with stuff like the RTX 5050 for $250, the RX 9060 XT 8 GB for $270, and the RTX 5060 for $300. Even then, what killed the RX 6600 more than anything was the fact that AMD just FINALLY phased it out of production a few months ago and it was no longer a cost effective recommendation.   And now, AMD pulls the rug from under RDNA2 users? This fast? Really?  I dont care if they axe RDNA1, the writing has been on the wall for RDNA1 for a while, no mesh shaders, RT, DX12 ultimate support, yeah, RDNA1 is done. But RDNA2 is still a viable architecture. Maybe it doesnt support the fancy AI bull#### for FSR4 or whatever. Do you know how much I care? Not at all. Im in a budget class where I dont care if I get the fanciest graphics. I just wanna RUN THE GAMES. And to do that, i need DRIVERS. There's no reason they can just make the games run FSR2/3 and allow older users to use that. Sure, maybe it will be blurrier, I admit FSR is an inferior upscaler, but it works, and again, I'd rather run a game with a little blur going on than not at all.   To not support the series with drivers, when this could render the GPU incompatible with new games is a DISGRACE. I bought my 6650 XT planning to use it until 2027, hoping that my next sub $300 GPU would offer twice the performance and more than 8 GB VRAM. I dont wanna upgrade now, spending $250-300 for 10-50% performance improvements (seriously, the 5050 is barely faster than the 6650 XT in raster) and 8 GB VRAM. I just dont. As such, I guess I'm gonna be stuck using an obsolete and no longer supported card for the mean time. Thanks a lot AMD. And oh, guess what, given that Nvidia is no longer charging like 50% more than AMD for the same class of product, I'm probably not gonna go AMD next time. Not if this is how I'm treated as a consumer.  Ive always been like at least somewhat biased toward Nvidia/intel because it seems like every time I buy AMD I get burned for some reason. SOmetimes its lack of VRAM, poor driver support, support for some BS API, or just poor performance like on older AMD CPUs I've owned. But yeah, they're just kinda giving me flashbacks to the late 2000s/early 2010s again when they didnt support their products while nvidia did. And I'm kinda feeling burned right about now.

AMD,"Let us retrace our steps to the spirited online debates of 2019, when early RDNA faced off against early RTX.  Early RDNA was pronounced the rational choice for the discerning enthusiast: modestly cheaper, often quicker in traditional rendering, and crucially unencumbered by ""gimmicks"" such as dedicated RT silicon or tensor cores. Ray-tracing was dismissed as an overpriced marketing indulgence, and DLSS was confidently predicted to vanish within the year. The RX 5700XT in particular was held up as an example: less costly than the RTX 2070 Super, marginally faster in raster. And best of all it was destined for superior longevity because the ""silly"" RT/AI gimmicks would surely perish like HairWorks. FPS-per-dollar at the moment of purchase would remain eternal as the only relevant metric of which GPU to buy.  Eternity, it seems, endured roughly until Adrenalin 25.10.2. AMD has now consigned both RDNA1 and RDNA2 to maintenance-only purgatory, with the driver graveyard following soon. Which is baffling considering how many systems and different products use early RDNA hardware. Even the RX 6750GRE finds itself affected, a card launched in late 2023. Imagine the uproar had NVIDIA deprecated the RTX2000+3000 series so quickly.  The RX 5700XT, once lauded for its value, is now remembered mainly for its hardware/software headaches. And when compared to the competition it now also lags in image quality (confined to FSR2/TAA) and framerate (due to increasing presence of RT in games). On the used market it usually trades for almost half the price of an RTX 2070 Super, a card it was supposedly better than in 2019.  Meanwhile the entire RTX 2000 series continues to receive full driver support, the GTX1000 cards that launched in 2016 are only starting to lose full support now. Games grow ever more dependent on RT. DLSS has become the gold standard rendering method and arguably the main reason NVIDIA secured overwhelming market share dominance in the 2020s. And even a 2018 RTX card benefits from the latest revisions and updates for all the newest ""gimmicks.""  AMD's 2025 RDNA4 series with its focus on ""ML accelerators"" and beefy RT units? They're actually pretty good cards (the 9070XT is AMD's best card in years) but they're also a belated concession by AMD that NVIDIA’s RTX blueprint was, in fact, the correct one. And the passage of time now positions early RDNA as a temporary measure, a stopgap until AMD figures out how to get back in the fight.  It remains quietly amusing how utterly wrong the YouTubers and online forums have misread the future about five-six years ago. Architecture/features/support, as it turns out, matter more than raster parity at a 5-10% discount.",Neutral

Those cards are also in 'maintenance mode'   making sure the game works with the card and bug fix and security patch if needed.      I can see why people are upset, but I also see it as AMD being transparent. Their older cards are in 'maintenance mode' now, which means they are still supported, will still get bug fixes, will still work with your games, but if you want the best experience, buy a newer card.      Nvidia does exactly the same, they just haven't given it a name.      Fight me 😂",Negative
AMD,"Outrage is fun, but no.  AMD state they will maintain it for bugs which is all it needs. These card are well understood by developers and game optimization is the ***developer's job*** not AMD's.  AMD might be involved in performance optimizations with new cards is when developers aren't familiar with them and new shaders (often based on old shaders) are found to not work well with very different architectures but that's not happening with cards designed in 2017.  There is no dropping of driver support. These are mature cards, known ISAs, they are already optimized for in current game engines.  If a developer is optimizing for RDNA2 and finds a bug AMD will still fix it. If AMD wants a new feature to run on these cards they will optimize for it. If there is a new DX12 or Vulkan extension AMD will add it. If a downstream customer has a problem (think Steamdeck, consoles etc) AMD will address it.

AMD,"Another windows related problem I'm glad I got rid off. I don't understand why an OS with such high market share gets dumped on so often by every manufacturer.  AMD and Intel GPUs run on open source drivers on Linux. Even all Nvidia RTX (GTX 16xx too) are getting more love on Linux nowadays.  Features and general improvements are still coming for Vega which I ran until recently. The oldest supported AMD GPUs on Linux are from the HD79xx series (real, not rebranded chips) from around 2012-2013 if I remember.   By supported I meant useful for daily use and normal consumers.  Meaning that all GPUs stated in the video are still completely fine, same goes for the USB-C output of the RX79xx.  In my eyes that's all planned obsolescence which here is irrelevant because of open source drivers. The corporations but also hundreds of free developers take part in.

AMD,"> To not support the series with drivers, when this could render the GPU incompatible with new games is a DISGRACE. I bought my 6650 XT planning to use it until 2027, hoping that my next sub $300 GPU would offer twice the performance and more than 8 GB VRAM. I dont wanna upgrade now, spending $250-300 for 10-50% performance improvements (seriously, the 5050 is barely faster than the 6650 XT in raster) and 8 GB VRAM. I just dont. As such, I guess I'm gonna be stuck using an obsolete and no longer supported card for the mean time.  To be clear, AMD is still providing drivers -- they're just not providing new game-specific driver-level optimizations.  I'm not sure how much this actually matters for older cards, since engine support for RDNA 2 and earlier should be pretty dialed-in to the point where driver-level optimizations shouldn't be as necessary. Not supporting new Vulkan extensions could potentially be problematic, but I'm also not sure it matters if these extensions are meant to support hardware that RDNA 2 cards (and earlier) don't have.  [Vega and Polaris are also in this ""extended support"" phase](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/17qn9e3/amd_begins_polaris_and_vega_gpu_retirement/), and looking at the driver pages for a Vega and Polaris card (I chose the Radeon VII and the Radeon RX 480), their latest driver update was in August 2025, which isn't that long ago.

AMD,"Fine wine definitely was a thing back with the GCN architecture. Part of GPU drivers is bug fixes, but the whole game ready part is Nvidia/AMD optimizing games for the developer. Back with GCN the AMD architecture was a bit more complex and developers used it poorly. Developers did stupid things like tessellating concrete barriers and the surface of the water to hell and back. So over time you would have real gains and the AMD cards would have a better lifespan than their Nvidia counterparts. The RX 580 was phenomenal.  I would call the fine wine back in the day more shitty developers than shitty drivers.  Fine wine ended with RDNA, it was much simpler to optimize and all over the consoles. That means RX 5000 series going forward don't get those same bumps over time and we've seen it.  AMD fans repeating fine wine these days are talking about a golden age of Radeon that has long since ended without ever having experienced it themselves.  The better aging has been on the Nvidia side with things like DLSS squeezing more performance out of cards. Framegen is going to be a godsend for the 40-series and 50-series in 4-5 years.",Neutral

Who do you think hired Jack Huynh, the ruthless businessman running Radeon (incl the guy before him, or the guy before that guy, Raja Koduri)? AMD's marketing is beyond embarrassing; they're simply pathetic. Robert Hallock was the only bright spot and he left in order to literally work for their biggest competitor.  You don't think she signs off on (or oversees) key business decisions like pricing, FSR, RT? What about the bumbling launch of Zen 5? Or how they asked influencers on how to price RDNA 4 and for months, the community basically *begged* them to not fuck up another golden opportunity (don't be or pull an AMD), and somehow they were still planning to launch w/ an MSRP of > $700 (\~$750, IIRC), up until the announcement and had to cancel the presentation hours before *during* CES.  Then, after all that, the BEST they managed to do was copy Nvidia (-$50) by listing a fake MSRP, at least in the US, then lied about availability when claiming inventory issues were solely due to demand despite having warehouses full of cards for months from the delayed launch which was due to waiting for Nvidia pricing + selling ALL RDNA 3 inventory to milk RDNA 4 pricing (and not due to the expiring rebates they weren't going to provide retailers or the fact that AIBs would only sell models > $2-300 above MSRP).    Meanwhile, you didn't think it was fishy that  coincidentally they just so happened to conveniently fail to manufacture Reference cards for the first time since I can even remember, meaning that RDNA 3/2/1, Vega, and Polaris ALL had reference cards, so at min dating back at least > a decade)?",Negative

AMD,">AMD state they will maintain it for bugs which is all it needs.  That's not what they do. They freeze development by branching the code bases off. This effectively means they no longer do development on the legacy branch.   Even in theory fixing bugs in old unmaintained code is difficult because it stops looking like the cold you're working on on a  regular basis. But in practice they basically never fix bugs outside of the most severe and most basic. Crash fixes to extremely  basic desktop use.  But at a broader general level your statement is incorrect. GPU drivers need constant development because the targets for development constantly change.   A new Vulkan version is imminent (announced by Mesa devs very recently), and RDNA 1 and 2 cards won't get it even though they're fully capable. New DX versions are released  frequently as well, again same issue.  Game development changes and they start using these newer APIs, or they use existing but barely or never used features, triggering issues in drivers due to lack of testing. This happens quite frequently. These GPUs are only a few years old , some 5 years max.   >If a developer is optimizing for RDNA2 and finds a bug AMD will still fix it.   They won't. They don't do any of this in the legacy branch for Vega.  >If AMD wants a new feature to run on these cards they will optimize for it. If there is a new DX12 or Vulkan extension AMD will add it. If a downstream customer has a problem (think Steamdeck, consoles etc) AMD will address it.  They've never done this for the legacy Vega branch. It's stuck at exactly the Vulkan and DX API when they froze development, even though the hardware is far more capable and is fully Vulkan 1.4 compatible along with a long list of other extensions AMD never added.   On Linux the development is partially done by the community and Valve at the kernel level,  and at the usermode level (for Vulkan) it's entirely by the Mesa community and Valve, with no AMD involvement.   As you can guess the driver support on Linux is light-years ahead. Everything from newest rdna4 to GCN 1.0 is still fully supported and updated with constant Vulkan extensions and full scale development broadly at all levels of the driver stack.   Yes this applies to all sorts of GCN hardware because they're extremely capable still. You can do shader emulated ray tracing on Vega and RDNA1 with playable performance.on Linux.

AMD,Having more VRAM than Nvidia was part of the fine wine.,Positive
AMD,"Well to some degree it was to be fair. Because some of their architectures were better suited for games that hadn't been launched yet.   GCN had a terrible CPU bottleneck compared to Maxwell/Pascal in many poorly threaded DX11 games. Which was alleviated by later DX12 games, or in some cases just from games adding DX12 support.   Not like that is only a AMD thing either. Kepler aged poorly as DX11 took over, even on cards that weren't VRAM constrained. Pascal similarly aged poorly vs Turing in many newer DX12 and Vulkan games. The performance didn't change much, just the games used to evaluate performance. Run the original test suite used at Turing launch and you will get the ""not much better for more money"" result again.",Negative

AMD,"> On Linux the development is partially done by the community and Valve at the kernel level, and at the usermode level (for Vulkan) it's entirely by the Mesa community and Valve, with no AMD involvement.  I think that's a little bit unfair towards AMD. On the kernel side, they put in the work with amdgpu, writing parts of it from scratch *and* getting it being accepted into the mainline kernel - which is a steep barrier to entry (the battles on the LKML were a fascinating read :) ), but which makes long-term support infinitely more viable due to the nature of Linux kernel development.  On the userland side: While RADV of course has been and still is first and foremost Valve-driven, the no AMD involvement hasn't been true anymore for a while. AMD driver devs have actively contributed to RADV for a while now, and recently they had the saliency to make Mesa RADV the officially supported Vulkan driver, going so far as to actually discontinue AMDVLK.

AMD abandoned their first proprietary driver of two (Amdvlk) in June on Linux for their Enterprise users. Amdgpu-Pro will soon follow. They are focusing on RADV now which is open source.  For example I reported an OpenGL bug 1.5 years ago on Vega and the first to take a look over it was someone working for AMD.  Official support drop on Windows: you're screwed on the first issue.

The Z2 Extreme that is in the Ally X is a major improvement to the Aerith chip in the Steam Deck and for $350 more than the 1TB OLED Steam Deck you are getting a performance boost, more ram, bigger battery, and better I/O in the form of two USB4 ports including one that meets the spec for Thunderbolt 4.     C.) Just because you don't like the price of something does not mean that it isn't worth it to someone. The only reason that the Steam Deck can be as cheap as it is, is because Valve prints money with their 30% cut on all platform sales, whereas ROG is unable to compete due to not being able to subsidize the costs even with the help of Microsoft.

I'd bet good money most are on B series boards which have a realistic power limit of 120W or so which would seriously hamper the performance of a 14900. Those boards would also enforce Intel's PL1 and PL2 limits which would force a downclock even if the VRM wasn't screaming for mercy.

Also there was that huge controversy about AMD not ""officially"" supporting Zen 3 on B350/B450 boards due to some of them having only 16MB bios chips, which they ended up walking back. That wouldn't have been the case without the pre-existing install base of B450 users.",Neutral
AMD,"Of course there would be a difference. drawcall forwarding is CPU intensive.  My assertion was not that they are CPU limited, but that they are not CPU heavy and thus not a good title for these tests in the first place. It does not provide valuable information. Instead it muddies the water with benchmark numbers not applcable to actually CPU heavy games, because their CPU use is completely different. Its like if you tested AVX512 performance and declared Zen 5 to be twice as fast as Zen 4, but in real world its actually only 8% faster because you arent bottlenecked on AVX512 but on something different.",Negative
AMD,"I can not find any actual gaming power consumption tests (outside igorlabs, who only played one even slightly CPU-intensive game and ran it on Ultra settings, averaging 80W). If you have power consumption benchmarks of this CPU in massive Rimworld bases, Factorio megabases, late-game Civ VI, or modded Paradox titles - let me know.  However, there is something that can help. https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i5-12600k-alder-lake-12th-gen/20.html - with only a single core being hammered by SuperPi, the CPU is already running on 87W. Just 1 p-core out of 6. If the game you are playing is at least a little optimized, it will get much higher.  And no, I did not own this CPU. I am not in the habit of picking up e-garbage anymore.",Neutral
AMD,Yes how since 7800x3d bottlenecks ur 4070s. How much perf are you missing out by not getting 9800x3d with ur rig im guessing 1440p. Thought cyberpunk numbers will be readily avaible since everyone ran the benchmark. so?,Negative
AMD,"Games are becoming more bandwidth sensitive, so while that was true at launch, it is less true today.",Negative
AMD,Maybe I just overestimate the capabilities of the average person,Neutral
AMD,I am lying? Zen 2 and 3 sales were much stronger than Zen 1 and 1+  I literally bought and build a Zen 2 system because of the new chipset features and faster ipc  Early adapters of am4 were amd users who were on bulldozer or phenom 2,Neutral
AMD,*Whole system 87 watts*  Keep moving the goalposts tho,Neutral
AMD,"Its hard to tell what the real performance difference is because theres a mix of single thread performance, cache size limitations, etc. I dont think cyberpunk is even good game to do this test on, its too GPU focused. Outside of my work which is CPU based, for gaming youd need to test in stuff like simulation, large scale strategy games and builders.   So there isnt a clear answer how much performance im loosing, but if we look at tests done for different use cases, its about 8%. As i do not own a 9800x3D i cannot test my own use case here.",Negative
AMD,a person looking for cpu reviews is far more tech savy than average.,Neutral
AMD,You have to remmeber that people in this sub are enthusiasts. We are not representative of average consumer.,Negative
AMD,"Zen 2 and 3 sales being stronger is in part due to it being a drop in upgrade for people who were already on AM4.Again, if there wasn't already a big install base of B350/450 users, then nobody would have cared about AMD being wishy washy about Zen 3 support on older chipsets.  >I literally bought and build a Zen 2 system because of the new chipset features and faster ipc  OK, if you want to talk about anecdotes then I 've literally upgraded somewhere between 15-20 AM4 systems with a mixture of 1000-2000 series chips to Zen 3 over the last few years.  >Early adapters of am4 were amd users who were on bulldozer or phenom 2  You're just making shit up.",Neutral

AMD,"Yeah, and most people here don’t bother to either",Negative
AMD,"No, you are making shit up for overstating zen 1’s popularity  So you are telling me that there are more new zen 1 sales than new zen 2 and 3 sales? There were more 300 and 400 chipset sales than 500 series? Just compare the number of motherboard models that were available. Zen 1 was not as popular as you think it was. It was losing to haswell in games and nobody was changing platforms from haswell/skylake to zen 1. Zen 2 and 3 was when amd really took off and had many new adapters but users were already on 500 chipset.",Negative

AMD,At that point get a used Rtx 2070 for $130 and a ryzen 5 5500 for $75. Total is just over $200 and the combination will perform better than a 3400G and b570.,Positive
AMD,Can you get a used 2070 for $130? That seems unlikely.,Neutral
AMD,I just confirmed on eBay   $130 Evga Rtx 2070 from a seller with 99.3% positive feedback from almost 500 reviews.,Neutral

AMD,Oh wow - I see it. Fair enough!,Positive
AMD,My quick search was wrong. I stand corrected.,Negative

AMD,"Yeah that'll handle a 9900x3D, note the mounting bracketry will be different. It should come with the AM5 mounting hardware you'll need.",Neutral
AMD,Id assume that would be more then enough? I have a 9950x3d and my coolers a thermal right phantom spirit evo 120mm and avg 70 or 80 C i believe,Neutral
AMD,"For gaming 9800X3D is faster. If you need the 4 extra cores for work, that makes sense.  I'd get a Phantom Spirit 120 instead of the cooler you selected, but the cooler you selected will cool a 9800X3D/9900X3D.",Neutral
AMD,"Add others have said, the 9900x3d is in a weird place because it's outperformed in games by its little brother the 9800x3d. Go with the 9800x3d or the 9950x3d if you need the cores for productivity tasks. The 7800x3d is also a very good option that will likely perform no differently than the other two if you're playing in 1440p or 4k.",Neutral
AMD,Yes.  But why?  Peerless Assassin SE cools more and costs 1/3 of that Corsair.  An AIO generally wont leak on you unless you somehow cut the tubes.  AIOs also have much larger thermal capacity which means you wont hit throttle as fast and cool off faster.

AMD,"I see, happy to hear  Thank you!",Positive
AMD,"One of the previous commets informed me that the 9800 is better, i thought the higher the number the better it usually is😅  Thank you!",Positive
AMD,"The reason i didnt go for the peerless assassin right away is because i can probably only get it through shipping and i generally prefer to buy it from a store i know, not a dealbreaker just a mild prefrence  While i know that aio's dont leak normaly it just scares me having something in my pc that if leaks will fry my build, even if the chances are very low, a bit of paranoia i guess you could say😅  I will check the video out, thank you!",Neutral
AMD,the 9900x3d is worse lmao,Negative
AMD,oh kewl,Neutral
AMD,"You can do that but coolers such as the Phantom Spirit are so easy to install. It’s not like 20+ years ago where they are clipped in and you risk cracking the die. But, since you seem to be getting a whole setup (new CPU means new mobo and in your case new ram), may as well get the shop to do it all since you don’t have experience.",Neutral
AMD,You're welcome,Neutral
AMD,"It depends, for gaming in this case it's actually worse.  For some professional applications, it often is.  If this is a gaming build, 9800X3D is the obvious choice.",Negative
AMD,"The way the cores are placed on the chiplets the 12 core is worse because you will either park half of the cores, turning it into a 6 core cpu or you will have cross talk between the caches on different dies, which just kills performance. On productivity applications this doesn't really happen since the code is very deterministic, but games with user input are not. So any advantage the additional cores will give you will be negated by the interconnect. So single ccd 8 core is much better. Especially with that 3dv cache which games just love.",Negative
AMD,"Oh lol, what a unique way of naming products",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, if i go through with this im probably swapping almost everything in my pc besides my gpu and power supply, seems best to leave it to someone who knows what theyre doing😅",Neutral
AMD,"Its isn't worse in general but worse for gaming.  9800x3d -> 8 cores with the 3d cache  9900x3d -> 12 cores total, split into 2 groups of 6 each. Only one group has the 3d cache, so its worse for gaming.   9950x3d -> 16 cores total, 2 groups of 8 each, one group with the 3d cache. So same for gaming as the 9800x3d with extra cores for productivity",Negative
AMD,"Do it once after watching a YouTube video and you'll be one of those people ""who know what they're doing"". If an ape like me can do it, you can too. Have some faith in yourself.",Neutral
AMD,9950x3d is 200 eir more at leasy where i live,Neutral
AMD,Yeah but it’s definitely more worth it over the 9800x3D if you’re working AND gaming,Positive
AMD,op didnt specify so i didnt recommend,Neutral
AMD,"yeah 9060. ram seems like it might be problematic for a longer time, so i'd grab the gpu before its price starts going up (this is why i bought recently). and i guess i wouldn't buy ram now.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, after I typed it all out I was thinking 9060 XT 16GB and grab another 16GB RAM before the prices get even more stupid",Negative
AMD,Setting up adrenaline and getting some what familiar with it can be confusing at frist put u gonna get the hang of it.  The settings describe what they do and are overall simular.,Neutral
AMD,"I once upgraded from Nvidia to AMD and felt the same excitement. I made sure to enable SAM, updated drivers carefully, and tweaked Radeon settings for smooth 1440p gaming. Performance surprised me.",Positive
AMD,"Overall, looks fine to me. The motherboard should come with a recent enough BIOS for that CPU, but in case it doesn't you can still use BIOS flashback to update it.  I checked the SSD and apparently it supports both 2x Gen5 and 4x Gen4 PCI-E modes, so it should be fine. Just put it in the correct M.2 slot on the motherboard and you'll be good to go; only one of them supports 4x PCI-E 4.0. It'll work elsewhere, but not at the rated speeds.  EDIT: Personally I'd suggest getting 2x 16 GB of RAM as 32 GB is the modern recommendation, but if you'll be replacing the board to AM5 soon anyway I suppose it doesn't really matter for the time being (as you'd be replacing the RAM anyway at that point).",Positive
AMD,Thank’s for your reply. Honestly I sincerely don’t think I’ll keep this configuration a whole year so that’s the reason for staying with 2x8gb in 2025,Positive
AMD,"Those are pretty GPU intensive games, I'd probably go a bit cheaper on the motherboard (B850) and CPU (7600/9600) to try and push the GPU to a RX 9070 or RTX 5070, or even 9070 XT / 5070 Ti if in budget.  Something like this: https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/2WpKYd  edit: Looking at the prices of all the cards, probably just consider RTX 5070 as the one tier up or the 9070 XT as the two tiers up. 9070 and 5070 Ti seem overpriced in Canada in comparison to the other cards.",Neutral
AMD,"Thank you so much for the advice, u/SaggitaryX ! I will definitely give those other GPUs a look. :) Thanks again!",Positive

AMD,WTH is the ram problem mostly a US problem. You forgot the case.  Cooler I would go with a dual air tower of some form thermalright peerless assassin or phantom spirit dual tower with 2 fans is what I would go with. I see a lot of people going thermalright royal knight that works as well. Even if the x3d cpu are efficient and don’t get  hot there isn’t any wrong with being a little overkill.,Neutral
AMD,"I have a very similar setup, have paired 7800x3D with Noctua NH D15. It's installed in Lian Li Lancool 216, works like a charm.",Positive
AMD,"The Spatium M461 uses QLC flash, which has low durability and becomes noticeably slower after a few years. Get a better drive with TLC flash like the Kioxia Exceria Plus G3, WD Blue SN5000, TeamGroup G50, Patriot P400 Lite, or Klevv CRAS C910.",Neutral
AMD,Noctua  Buy once cry once,Neutral
AMD,I honestly don't care about the RGB at all I just got it because it was cheap (managed to get a good deal). Thanks for the advice!,Positive
AMD,Thank you! I was considering the Thermalright Peerless Assassin 140 because it's not all too expensive so it's good to know it'd work!,Positive
AMD,Would a thermalight 120 be enough or do you think it'd be worthwhile for me to splash out on a 140?,Neutral
AMD,"We've got the ram problem in the UK too, it was about £160/70 a week ago, I just got a particularly good deal for mine (£117).  Thanks for the cooler recomendations! I'm still deciding on a case to get and whether to go really budget or get something cool like the silverstone flp02.",Positive
AMD,"Meh. Thermalright has shown so much at this point that they can produce a cooler that works damn near as well as a Noctua NH-D15 at like 1/3 the price that it makes the Noctua a hard sell.   And then fans of Noctua will usually be like, ""Yeah but Noctua sends out mount kits for free!!"". While this is true, you have to pay for shipping - so it isn't quite ""free"". Additionally, the whole ""free mount kit"" is something that a lot of cooler manufacturers have picked up on and are also doing now. I don't know that Thermalright is doing it, but I don't know that they aren't either.   Beyond this, if you pay $130 for a Noctua NH-D15 (the cheapest variant currently), you can buy a Thermalright Dual tower 3-4 times. Or a Dual Tower, a 360mm AIO, and another dual tower.   It's just really hard to justify Noctua's pricing anymore. I'll concede that they are ""the best"", but when you can get 95% of the performance for 25% of the cost, it's a hard argument to make.",Neutral
AMD,It's sufficient. 7800X3D is a very low power CPU.,Neutral
AMD,Yeah but that is still a lot better than the US it was at like $130 which is £98.68 and has climbed to $220 which £160-£170 plus. I think ram prices are going down in the US anyway time soon😭😭. I’m glad you got good deals and great pc by the way happy building when you get everything together.,Positive
AMD,I’ve been doing this a long time and I’ve never wished for less cooling. I went Thermalright for a decade  Noctua is buy once cry once.   AIO’s are trash with limited lifespans. I built a custom loop 15 years ago and will never do watercooling again; ugh!,Negative
AMD,It’s more supported than FSR and arguably better quality even if it’s by a little bit but personally i’m more surprised with MFG.,Positive
AMD,"DLSS is better than FSR, but *how much better* is massively overblown. If you're getting better value on the AMD card (you almost certainly are) - I'd take that. Also depends on how many GB of VRAM comes with the models you're looking at.",Positive
AMD,To me dlss is worth 50$ on low end cards and 100$ on mid and high end.  I would go amd if its at least this much cheaper than the comparable nvidia card.,Positive
AMD,"It basically runs the game at a lower resolution so you get the performance bump, then uses some AI magic to scale up the image to your actual resolution so it doesn't look as bad.  AMD has the similar feature that isn't as good yet as others said.  If they're the same price or within a few dollars, just go NVIDIA. If the AMD card is much cheaper and you have other uses for the money, just go with that.",Negative
AMD,"Whatever you do, make sure you get the 16gb variant of either card. NOT the 8gb",Neutral
AMD,DLSS has way bigger support for games.  AMD also missing some features that nvidia has.  DLSS Ray Reconstruction  RTX video super resolution.  RTX HDR.  NVIDIA broadcast.  4:2:0 and 4:2:2 support for video editing  Better video encoder.  Hardware FP4,Neutral
AMD,"I have a 5070 and liking DLSS a lot. I find it generally much better than TAA or other forms of anti-aliasing, it really helps both performance and visuals in many games. It's got wider game support and overall I have found it more usable and easier to apply. It's def helps at 4K especially. AMD hasn't really been able to push newer FSR versions down to the older GPUs the same way Nvidia has done with RTX cards, so I think this has helped a lot over time with support and use.  With this said, it's not an absolute dealbreaker to have it or not. Many games don't even use or have DLSS or FSR support at all. Where I have found it to shine most is games where the TAA or other anti-aliasing used looks bad, and especially in games that are on UE5 engine I have seen the most benefits using DLSS so far.",Positive
AMD,"Ditto the person that says 'it depends on the game', I did not realize DLSS was the reason why my game kept crashing every so often when I was playing Nioh 2 until I googled it. Needed to keep DLSS off to stop the crashes  And as strange as it sounds, I think AMD's FSR was better for me than DLSS back when I was playing MHWilds at Launch (no idea if they ever fixed the performance issues)  Just my personal experience with my Nvidia 3070",Neutral
AMD,"You should mainly look at the games you play and check YouTube for performance. I'm a BF (only) player, so I went with AMD. Maybe the games you play favor Nvidia, so that's what I would take in consideration.   Also, price should be a factor imo especially at the price range you're shopping. Where I'm from the 5060ti is about 50 to 100 euro more expensive, I don't think that's a lot personally. But the 9060xt is about 300, so 50 to 100 euro more is quite an increase in price.",Neutral
AMD,"It depends on the game you are trying to play and the implementation of it.  DLSS is always better than FSR at any scenario cause DLSS4 is insane while FSR4 is not 100% there yet, but its much better than it was.  At 1440p if the game you plan to play has FSR4 implemented correctly, you go for AMD to save those 50-100$.  You go for nvidia for any other scenario if you can tell the difference between the blurriness.  What DLSS does is, runs the game at a lower resolution than your chosen/monitor and then uses software/""ai"" to get rid of the pixelation/blur with upscaling, its basically a type of Anti-aliasing.",Positive
AMD,"DLSS4 and FSR4 are pretty on par, but DLSS4 is supported by more games.",Positive
AMD,"FSR 4 is amazing, you won't notice a difference and guess what Redstone was announced for December 10.",Positive
AMD,Which ever is cheaper. FSR is good enough and it has frame gen.,Positive
AMD,"Really depends on your budget.  Like it’s not worth $150, but it’s worth $100 or less.",Neutral
AMD,AMD has caught up to DLSS more or less. But DLSS still has an advantage over FSR because more platforms(games) support DLSS than FSR. Thats about it,Neutral
AMD,Yes. Yes. Yes. Massive different,Neutral
AMD,I love how native fsr AA is,Positive
AMD,"I'd go 5060 TI personally. DLSS is better, Multi frame gen if you want it, better Ray Tracing etc.   That said if you were looking at 5070, 9070, 5070 Ti, or 9070 XT, I'd say just get the 9070 XT at $580-$600. The 9070 XT is absolutely worth it over the 5070 for the performance and 16GB VRAM and it's much cheaper than the 5070 TI.",Positive
AMD,Yes.,Neutral
AMD,"The entire Nvidia feature set, over AMD, and not just DLSS4 over FSR4, is completely worth it.  But it's totally dependent on the price you're paying for it. How much were you quoted for both of these cards?",Positive
AMD,It depends on the price difference and how much you value your money.,Neutral
AMD,"Definitely go with 5060ti the Nvidia ""features"" are definitely Worth   I switched to Nvidia this gen and couldn't be more happy honestly. Used to run on AMD gpus but this gen i decided to go with a 5090 because i could and i wouldn't want to buy AMD again now after having used dlss, framegen and RT  Game support is also vastly better meaning i could use DLSS 4 on every new game on day1 already. With AMD i was used to eight waiting for features to be added or had to do it myself its honestly super refreshing to just boot up a game with the knowledge of ""im getting everything out of my GPU and all its features""   Dlss 4 looks so good compared to FSR especially because its available in EVERY game unlike FSR4   Framegen is amazing playing cp77 maxed 4k with PT and getting 200+ fps feels so incredibly nice (granted is a 5090)   Again after swapping to Nvidia this gen i would highly recommend it over AMD now it is my first Nvidia card since the gtx780",Positive
AMD,"I was in the same situation as you, literally a week ago, and I went with the 5060ti 16gb.  FSR4 is, in fact, way better than the previous version, but it is still FSR. You can instantly know which game has FSR enabled vs DLSS.  DLSS not only looks almost native without smearing or ghosting, but it also gives you significantly more FPS than FSR..  Sadly, DLSS is just superior. I paid $100 more for the 5060ti instead of the 9060, and it was just for the DLSS, but I'm not even disappointed.  A nice plus for the 5060ti is also the FrameGen. I only used FSR FrameGen and LSFG3.1 before, and I had zero expectations for the NVIDIA FrameGen but man, it's actually pretty good.",Positive
AMD,Not really fsr4 + sharpening tool look so much better,Positive
AMD,Dlss is better but Fsr4 vastly narrowed the gap learn your way around optiscaler and support is near universal. If you haven’t decided on vram yet get 16gb,Positive
AMD,"For me it was. I just find more titles support it, and I prefer to have it on (Upscaling, Frame Gen) than off.  It let's me hit 4k 120fps when it's available, and playing like that is just so crispy and smooth.",Positive
AMD,It's better but AMD is cheaper and better with Linux.,Positive
AMD,"Fsr 4 is close enough to DLSS that I wouldn’t use that as the selling point.  If you really want ray tracing, Nvidia is still really the only option.  AMDs primary benefits over Nvidia are the price and frame stability.  Nvidia cards lately have had inconsistent frame timing.  That being said, most game devs develop with Nvidia in mind primarily. I’ve had plenty of driver crashes on my 7900 xtx. I ended up selling it and buying a 4090.  Am I happy with that decision? Not really, I hate supporting Nvidia these days. But I just ran into too many issues with my 7900.",Neutral
AMD,"Depends on the pricing. I personally would be willing to pay a 10% for DLSS and everything else over AMD but that’s because I REALLY like and use those AI features. A little wiggle room for rounding and stuff.  Example of a 9060xt 16gb was $350, I’d be willing to pay up to ~$385 for a 5060ti 16gb.   If a 9070xt was $600 I’d be willing to pay ~$660 for a 5070 ti.",Positive
AMD,"I went Nvidia this time because I do see the value of it actually being supported more widely. AMD is a hit or miss. They never are consistent. That being said though, I had zero issues with my 5700xt. Can't go wrong with either.",Positive
AMD,"Consider that AMD is hardware locking new versions of FSR and if that downside is worse than Nvidia offering lower VRAM in equivalent GPUs, generally speaking. I have a 7900XTX and the fact FSR redstone will not be coming to it has me more than a bit pissed. But if I bought the “equivalent” Nvidia at the time I would have only 16GB of VRAM for $200 more.",Negative
AMD,"I went for the extra 4gb VRAM (which was the same as my old card,) vs DLSS.  I love raytracing but prefer having the vram then a higher frame rate.",Positive
AMD,"DLSS is a bit better than FSR but not good enough to warrant the price difference between Nvidia and AMD. If two comparable cards are $100-150 apart in price take the AMD one, if the difference is >$100 take the Nvidia card.   FSR has caught up a lot to DLSS and I expect them to be nearly on the same level within this decade.",Neutral
AMD,It depends on how you want to get out of the pc like if it is just pure gaming I would go with the 9060xt cause you still have ray tracing and gram gen and if it more like AI or cad work or just overall work with that area then 5060 Ti,Neutral
AMD,"FSR4 is decent and can be injected into games with a dll swap now. DLSS transformer model is still better though, but not by much.",Positive
AMD,"Yes, but reddit will tell.you otherwise.  Just look how the most upvoted comment here is completely ignoring the main issue with FSR: it's availability.",Negative
AMD,"You will hear many different answers and you really have to see for yourself. I’d say DLSS is game changer. Specifically, the multi frame gen which everyone hates.",Positive
AMD,"Comes down to what games you're wanting to play, and not knowing what games you'll play in the future. For me, I'd go with AMD because I'm of the ""Fuck Nvidia"" crowd after what they've done to gaming GPUs in the last 5 years. Got my first AMD card this year and loving my 7900XT",Neutral
AMD,I will only say I have the 9070XT and I am very pleased with FSR4. Now with Redstone we might see more improvements.,Positive
AMD,yes. especially when its paired up with nvpi. your games. your way.,Neutral
AMD,Combined with mfg. Easily!,Neutral
AMD,"i went from an RX 9070 XT - > RTX 5080.  I cannot tell the difference between DLSS transformer and FSR4 myself, although I have seen videos noting the slight differences.  Just go with whatever is cheaper.",Neutral
AMD,"DLSSis far superior than AMDs FSR , FSR is getting there. But the reason why DLSS is so much better is because it's on a hardware level where FSR is in on a software/firmware level.",Positive
AMD,Fsr is excellent in BF6 and B07,Neutral
AMD,Maybe wait for the redstone release?,Neutral
AMD,"5060ti: dlss is still superior to fsr, and likely will stay that way. It’s roughly one gen ahead now, used to be about 2. Fsr still causes me massive twinkling issues in some games where it’s not present in dlss. I’d get a higher powered amd card to push through, or a lower tier nvidia to use software advantage.",Neutral
AMD,Even FSR3.1 is perfectly fine.   Pixel prying is something for snobs and tech YTbers... and marketing firms.  Both cards have XeSS 2.0 and even that is pretty much the same. It upscale. It make game run better. Wow.,Positive
AMD,"What would you buy if you have absolutely 0 interest in using DLSS or FSR or Ray Tracing, etc   And just want, raw, general purpose GPU power?",Neutral
AMD,"Nah, owned both never really cared. Fsr works fine outside of 1080p anything lower than quality",Neutral
AMD,"That depend, if you can get a high end AMD card with xxl ram that don’t need up scaling go for it. I’m an Nvidia user, dlss is fine but a friend who have XTX something can have the double the fps I get in certain game without fake frame or up scaling …  Maybe Dlss is interesting if you want to play high frame rate 4K",Positive
AMD,Yes.,Neutral
AMD,"FSR4 is almost the Same as DLSS. You dont need Nvidia, in 1-2 years every new Game will Support FSR4.",Positive
AMD,"DLSS is a bit better than FSR but the biggest advantage is availability, so yeah if the price difference isn't that big, definitely go 5060ti, upscaling is very important for cards like this",Positive
AMD,DLSS just downgrades your image. I always make sure it’s off. This shouldn’t be a decision maker for you.,Negative
AMD,"Whichever works the best for your needs.   Frames may be similar (16gb Vram models) but Nvidia bests on Ray Tracing, DLSS, MFG, Cuda cores (amd doesn't have any), reflex, and NVEC codec for streaming.",Positive
AMD,"I recently upgraded to an AMD card from an Nvidia card. I would say that I haven't noticed a difference between DLSS and FSR. There may be one, but there isn't one that I can notice.",Neutral
AMD,"I played through Borderlands 4 and currently playing Battlefield 6 with a friend of mine. I have a 7900XTX and they have a 5080. I've gotten better performance than him across the board, enabling Ultra in BL4 (150+) and Overkill in BF6 (200+).  I don't know shit about either technology, but after buying a 1080ti I swore I'd never pay more than $1000 for a highend card again.",Positive
AMD,"given that RDNA2 cards are basically EOL already, i'd easily choose the 5060 Ti  and I own 9060 XT 16GB",Neutral
AMD,Nvidia has a larger driver team so new games get updates much sooner on a regular basis.  Also the MFG is really good IMHO and makes most games feel smoother.  AMD has great drivers and FSR4 is really good between 9060xt and 5060ti 16gb variants it’s about a 50$ savings but I would still lean towards Nvidia more. Your also within spitting distance of a 5070 or a 9070 which are both about a 20 percent improvement. If you can spend a little more not a bad option.,Positive
AMD,"Go for the 16GB version of either. If they're the same price, get the 5060ti because it's slightly faster. The MSRP of the 9060xt 16GB is $349. If you can get it near that price, that's $80-$100 cheaper than 5060ti and outweighs the 5060ti's meager lead in performance",Neutral
AMD,"bro get an nvidia. i regret my rx 6800 all the time, so many driver issues and yes i DDU my driver installs and am fairly computer competent.   these drivers are ass and theyre just plain late to the game when it comes to updating for new games, as well as they just plain break their driver updates far too often",Negative
AMD,Do a blind test and see if you notice,Neutral
AMD,Poors will say it’s not but it is.,Neutral
AMD,"Pretty equal imo, though dlss is supported in more games. However what many don't mention in the comments is Nvidia's overhead issue, with amd your cpu matters less.",Neutral
AMD,People say that frame generation is a sham but if it makes the difference between choppiness and smooth motion then I particularly don’t give a fuck.  I care about whatever works to boost the capacity of my frames while also keeping the highest video settings available.,Negative
AMD,"it's really ONLY worth it if you are on RDNA 3 or lower. Simply because it's more FAFO to get comparable quality. On the 9000 series, FSR 4 sometimes looks better than DLSS and you can enable it in basically every game. It's still more FAFO than DLSS, but not much. Most games will allow driver-level FSR 4 at the very least.",Positive
AMD,"Depends on your targeted monitor  resolution & refresh rate,  and fps  & type of games you want to play.   If you want 1080p 240Hz then dlss4 upscaling is better because 720p upscaled to 1080p by dlss4 quality looks almost indistinguishable from 1080p dlaa.    If you want 1440p 60fps the the difference between fsr4 and dlss4 is smaller. So the cheaper card the 9060xt wins.   If you want 4K 240Hz just get a 5070ti or 9070xt.   The frame generation part, is making too many artifacts and ghosting to be used seriously.   It can be used ""to win more"" if you are like playing some game (not a competetive shooter)and are getting 100+ fps  to double it and have like 200+ fps on a variable refresh monitor, or like fps cap at 240fps so you have that ultra smooth video oitput while the input latency is not bad.   Going from 30fps to 120fps with dlls4 multi frameven  utter shit and worse than just playing with flat stable 30fps. ​",Neutral
AMD,I would be more excited about DLAA.,Neutral
AMD,"I would pick Nvidia over AMD, personally. The Nvidia suite is just too good compared to AMD I would probably spend $150 more for the same tier card.   DLSS is better than FSR. I use CUDA (major, major influence) in multiple softwares. Better RT performance (prob lower on the list as of 2025–few titles force it). DLSS support on a much, much larger directory of games. NVENC is better than AMD's H.264 encoder.",Positive
AMD,"Many people won't even notice the difference between dlss and fsr. I was disappointed with Nvidia cards, the budget ones are very bad in native mode.",Negative
AMD,"IMO as a casual gamer using AMD, even on games that I used the built-in upscaler of the driver (which is supposed to be FSR1, ""absolute terrible"" in internet standard). I really have to look for the artifact/blurriness to be able to barely see them. As soon as I go back to gameplay, I never notice anything.  Even in game with native FSR3 support (my card can't do 4), I have to directly switch between native AA and FSR quality to notice the difference, if I am just given the PC and play, I would never be able to tell it FSR is on or not.",Negative
AMD,"Dlss 3 vs fsr 3 was like  Dlss a bit better on quality mode and fsr 3 below quality was dogshit.  It was a selling point. Fsr 3 was shit on foliage.    Dlss 4 and fsr 4 are trading blows both even on balanced often beat taa native and are comparable. Dlss 4 transformer has a few random issues but overall its slightly better    Dlss does slightly better on slow constant moving objects and fsr 4 does better on volumetric effects.   Fsr 4 ray reconstruction is closer to proper but dlss rr is slightly better     Fsr 4 and dlss 4 are close enough its no big deal. But other Nvidia features might be worth.   Higher end Nvidia cards win on ai, ray tracing and cuda as and Zluda emulation isnt perfect yet.",Negative
AMD,"Both are a smeary mess, I’d rather pick something with better raw performance and play at lower fps but without blurring and artefacts",Negative
AMD,DLSS is still inconsistent per game ime.,Neutral
AMD,"It also depends on the game, but in general, DLSS is at least as good as FSR, but usually, it gives a better image quality.  That said, it seems that the difference between DLSS 4 and FSR 4 is not as big, so AMD is slowly catching up.  But the FSR 4 version is barely available yet we can not see the future for now.  Likely RTX card still has a slight advantage in ray tracing performance, but again, the gap is not that big.  RTX 5060 TI is likely slightly stronger in raster/pure performance but the 9060XT is a better value for dollar IF you only care about raster performance and do not use ray tracing.  NVIDIA is usually better at encoding and some other stuff if you do streaming and so on, but if you don't, you are paying some extra for that as well.    Now the question is how much extra you need to pay for the 5060TI over AMD, price difference likely also depends on the country you live in.  And I would not choose the 8GB version in any recent card, both Ray tracing and even Frame generation tools also increase VRAM usage. So an 8GB card often can not even use those features.  Borderlands 4 on all low 1080p is already close to 8GB VRAM.  If you want to max Resident Evil 4 from early 2023 with ray tracing on, including 8GB textures, you already above 10GB VRAM at 1080p.  So 8GB has zero future proof; they are not even past proof.",Neutral
AMD,"Depends on what ""it"" is. Its worth a 10% premium to me.",Neutral
AMD,"Get the 5060. AMD just isn’t competitive enough yet with their software, except for upscaling. FSR comes close to DLSS, but doesn’t quite meet it. Plus DLSS has support in way more games than FSR",Neutral
AMD,"I bought nvidia over amd because of dlss and shadow play (or whatever it's called now). I value getting high fps and, at 1440p, even my 4070ti can struggle without dlss. Struggle for me is not breaking 100-120fps. I know it's a big margin, but I basically want smoothness with a high Hz monitor. So, I turn on dlss to quality and, boom, I'm good. I genuinely don't notice a difference quality wise. Maybe I'm not looking hard enough. And I won't,  I'm happy.",Neutral
AMD,"DLSS 4 is fine for upscaling, but looks like pixelated oversharpened crap compared to FSR 4 at native resolution.

AMD,I’d go with the 5060Ti for MFG.,Neutral
AMD,Dlss isnt that much better than fsr and the 9060 xt has more raw performance and lower costs,Positive
AMD,9060xt Amd has their own version of DLSS they do the same thing,Neutral
AMD,"No, it is not. FSR4 is on par with DLLS4, and with the drivers and FSR game can be upgraded to FSR4 without waiting for the devs to do it. Also FSR Redstone is confirmed to be released on the 10th of december, so its gonna get even better.",Positive
AMD,yes it's better than FSR,Positive
AMD,It is not.  Especially when Redstone is coming out in like a month,Neutral
AMD,FSR4 is good enough as an upscaler if you don't mind enabling it for AMD on a game by game basis. What you should be considered with is the performance delta between 9060XT and 5060Ti. In some games it's a trivial 0-5 FPS but in other games you'll see a 15+ FPS swing. Figure out what you play and see if it matters or not.,Neutral
AMD,9060 XT and it's not very close if the prices of both are close to historical average,Neutral
AMD,"I have Intel/Nvidia but I rarely use DLSS because native looks so much better to me. My monitor is 5120x1440p OLED so a lot of real estate and sometimes I need DLSS with frame gen to get my RTX 4080 to get over 120FPS, otherwise I don't use it. AMD has its own alternatives and is just fine for the same purpose. My ONLY reason for using Nvidia is the driver updates are easy with no DDU needed, just update and go. On my laptop, AMD Adrenaline gives me issues every third update where I need to uninstall and reinstall fresh. I don't have time for that on my work machine.",Neutral
AMD,"Nvidia if your looking to do other stuff with the GPU (ai, blender, etc) cuda has a massive head start and amd will take years to catch-up since they started late",Neutral
AMD,"If you have the money I will definitely recommend Nvidia not only dlss  But if you wanted to do productivity later on, nvidia is far ahead in that sector",Neutral
AMD,"I thought it was but I realized, slowly, that I end up mostly playing competitive games online and I have read that FSR and DLSS, both, can add some input lag.   I'm not a sweaty gamer but I would like the lowest input lag realistically when playing a game where milliseconds count.   I played Ghost of Tsushima and Clair Obscur upscaled and I'm not sure I noticed a difference. Admittedly, I don't know how all these features work but for reference, I play with a 7900xtx in 4K.   For single player games, I bet it looks nice, especially DLSS. But for COD, Halo, etc., which is what I still play more often than single player games, I think these features introduce a little bit of a disadvantage.",Neutral
AMD,"with fsr4, not really, fsr4 has become way too good U don't notice any difference between dlss4 and fsr4 unless U really look for it, so no not really, also there are tricks to make fsr4 work on older AMD cards which is insane lol.like the 6000 series and the 7000 series and it's super good there are videos about it on YouTube",Positive
AMD,I havent tried DLSS 4 but FSR4 to me on my 9070xt is no different than DLSS3 on my 3080 was.  I would choose which ever one allows you to afford 16gb of memory thats what really matters.,Neutral
AMD,"In general, DLSS remains the superior upscaler, particularly for lower-end cards. You get better frame generation support and smoother performance with the 5060 Ti if the prices are close. Use AMD only if the price is significantly lower for the same performance.",Positive
AMD,"Having both 9070xt fsr4 and dlss on both 5070ti and 4080, on RT/PT games, no, it's simply not worth the premium.  I see people dogging 9070xt and praising 5070ti if it's just a 100 dollars more, it's just mostly mob mentality without adequate experience.  In reality they're not only super close, in fact many titles 5070ti gets beat.  Your case is the 9060xt/60ti, and it's completely based on what price you can get either.  In addition the rtx dy vib and other filters, only sharpen+ is worth any good.  If it's a decision between fsr3 cards and 5060ti, then you'd go 5060ti, but 9060xt is a fairly good card for the price if you can find the higher vram card at lowish price",Negative
AMD,"First, DLSS is a *suite* of features. It includes Super Resolution (upscaling), Ray Reconstruction, Reflex, Frame Generation, Multi Frame Generation, etc. AMD has *some* similar features, but not all, and those they do have are inferior to Nvidia's offerings. FSR4 (the AMD equivalent of DLSS SR), is the closest in terms of matching Nvidia, but even that is still not quite as good.  Whether it's ""worth it"" or not, though, is a personal decision. If the things DLSS offers are of value to you, then it's probably worth it. If not, maybe it's not. Nvidia is in an entirely different league, here, though.",Neutral
AMD,"In one case to get decent quality you need to use third party tools like Optiscaler all the time as a kind of hack to work around the fact that FSR4 is just not supported by hardly anything compared to DLSS.  In the other case, it just works and the vast majority of games are just going to support it natively out of the box.  How comfortable you are with relying on unofficial workarounds for basic upscaling feature support should factor into this not just the end result.",Neutral
AMD,It is insanely better than FSR so yes.,Positive
AMD,"DLSS 4 is way better than FSR, Imagine image blurry to non-blurry.   Watch simple comparison on YouTube and judge for yourself",Positive
AMD,"Yes, always, DLSS is better. All the people out there claiming ""upscaling sux"" are AMD users because FSR just looks terrible, meanwhile Nvidia users are upscaling even on 5090's because it looks better than native. Yes FSR4 was a massive improvement, but only the most recent games support it and DLSS4 is still way better again.",Positive
AMD,"No, not anymore.",Neutral
AMD,Yes because it will be in every game unlike fsr4.,Neutral
AMD,"they both make fake frames  the 9060xt 16gb performs similarly to the 5060ti 16gb, the only reason I'd take the 5060ti 16gb is if you need CUDA or the prices are extremely similar (9060xt 16gb should be ~$80 cheaper)",Negative
AMD,Yes,Neutral
AMD,"I'm not picky about DLSS but with recent debacle, AMD shows that they willing to drop support for older card unless the community push back",Negative
AMD,Yeah mfg is really good on nvidia stuff. I know i am going to get some haters on this comment about input lag etc. but if you use it in graphically demanding single player games it’s great and tbh I don’t even notice it’s on.,Positive
AMD,I’ve liked FG since day one despite the hate it gets,Positive
AMD,"Same here. MFG is amazing. DLSS for your resolution, MFG for your refresh rate, paired up it’s the best experience I’ve had with a GPU and perceived gains.  Today I had left my performance analysis stuff off and I couldn’t tell if I’d left MFG on or off. I think it was on. But I’m not sure. It looked absolutely smooth and I realized you know what? That’s what matters, it feels so damn good that you may as well put it to use, the tensor cores aren’t there for nothing.",Positive
AMD,DLSS used to be much better but AMD has caught up significantly,Positive
AMD,"Recent change though. DLSS used to be a large gain over FSR 2/3.  FSR 4 is finally the real deal, and now the gap is small.",Positive
AMD,"I would often notice smearing/ghosting with FSR 2, but FSR 4 seems pretty good. I would pick NVIDIA if I wanted CUDA support, but DLSS and ray tracing don’t seem like a big advantage for NVIDIA anymore.",Neutral
AMD,"I had an Rtx 3080 (no frame gen but still dlss4 upscaling) and upgraded to a 9070xt. I cannot tell the difference between dlss4 and fsr4. I thought maybe I wasn’t looking in the right place so I tried looking at YouTube video comparisons, still couldn’t tell. I read articles with screenshots to find exact frames, still pretty much identical. Who knows what the future holds for dlss5 and fsr5 but for right now I’m happy with what I have.",Neutral
AMD,"Exactly. It's worth a small premium of like $50, but more than that and it comes down to what you play IMO. FSR is catching up quickly in supported games, and I think we're going to see it continue to catch up with AMD gaining some market share this gen.",Positive
AMD,"You people beeing so insanly biased to upvote this post the most is genuienly a thing that needs to be studied.  Anyone halfway impartial would at least mention that one of the issues with FSR is it beeing much less wide spread.  But not on reddit it isn't, where you guys somehow love AMD as a company and hate Nvidia with a burning passion, when it's all literally the same.  These companies are not your buddys.",Negative
AMD,">but *how much better* is massively overblown.  I think it's justified. DLSS 4 is truly amazing, and I'm the last person to want to praise Nvidia.  DLSS 4 is literally a resolution step above FSR which is by now slightly better than DLSS 3. Meaning, DLSS 4 performance mode is comparable to FSR's best mode in picture quality, while rendering way less pixels.  I was seriously considering AMD since it's the first time I went with an AMD CPU, but after researching upscale technologies I realized it's still a one way street.",Positive
AMD,Not sure that 16GB of VRAM would help a 5060 very much,Negative
AMD,"I respect your opinion but I chime in to say that DLSS and FSR are now basically on par. The price difference you are stating might have been true before FSR 4 but now that is too much. I would say half of that or even less.  Edit: I checked again a comparison video and I stand corrected. Definitely worse than DLSS4, still not enough to justify a 100$ price difference in my opinion, but yeah, definitely not on par yet.",Negative
AMD,DLSS does look better than FSR4 still as well remember. FSR 4 has caught up from where FSR3 was but its not on par,Positive
AMD,This is the only right answer in this thread. Look at games you play and performance. Also take into account what cpu and specs you have while doing so.,Neutral
AMD,">DLSS is always better than FSR at any scenario  No, DLSS 4 is much worse at native resolution, it creates lots of pixel junk.

AMD,"9070xt is #1 selling card, all new games are coming with FSR4.  And it is excellent.  Better than not using it, imo.",Positive
AMD,This right here,Neutral
AMD,Framegen is amazing.  I have no idea whay AMD people constantly hate on it.  In another comment i made i explained my switch to Nvidia this gen and after using FG a few times i can confidently say it great nowhere near as much input lag as AMD people like to say the input lag wasn't noticeable at all and i tried it in many games by now.  The quality difference was basically non existent and DLSS transformer model just look so much better than FSR did and is available in every game without stupid soft mods like i had to do with FSR basically daily,Positive
AMD,"Here's how DLSS 4 DLAA compares to FSR 4 Native AA: [Stalker 2](https://slow.pics/s/mgXoZH5C), [Cyberpunk 2077](https://slow.pics/s/zBhq6Ghw), [Infinity Nikki](https://slow.pics/s/cBa3Qbis), [Horizon Forbidden West](https://slow.pics/s/pBTTfQ6I), [Stellar Blade](https://slow.pics/s/D0fX27kL). Tl;dr DLSS 4 doesn't do much in terms of AA.",Neutral
AMD,What  Thats just not true lol,Neutral
AMD,"Exactly this!!   I swapped from AMD to Nvidia this gen because i could (5090) and after using it for a while im so much more happy with it than wirh any AMD gpu i had before   The software was just ""better"" it never crashed or had stupid errors for me  Dlss4 being available from day1 in games is a godsend no more stupid self modding features into the game  Dlss4 looks so good especially the transformer model. and i was turned of by FG for a while (mainly because i haven't used it yet) after using it i can definitely say AMD people don't know what they are missing out xD   Never going to buy AMD cards again after my Nvidia experience honestly unless AMD finally catches up fully and doesn't just run behind.  And honestly the extreme coping the AMD community does since the rtx3000 series also just heavily put me off from getting AMD again this gen. It feels like they refuse to accept new features unless they get them too.  When upscaling frist came around (dlss1) i hated on it too but dlss1 was terrible but the hate continued with rhe community all the way to the 30 series until they got FSR and suddenly upscaling was a great tech... Its such a superficial community i realized and that just really put me off from getting AMD again because with a fanbase like this how can you innovate?",Positive

AMD,I tried 2x MFG with CP2077 and immediately turned it off because I can’t stand the input lag and how it negatively affects my aiming in FPS games. I’m pretty sure it will be fine for story driven games or games where you don’t really need precise controls or a lot of aiming.,Negative

For me, the input lag with anything other than reflex boost felt painful to play with, as someone that tends towards slow crit damage weapons in that franchise.

AMD,"I'm surprised that I haven't seen 2.5 things mentioned in the discussion thus far.   First, the PS5 Pro being likely to drive development. Even if you don't care about consoles, the PS5 Pro pushing FSR 4.0 support could be massive for day one FSR 4.0 support especially in titles focusing on cross-platform development.   Second: DLSS is a general model while FSR 4.0 is game specific.  Two-point-fifth: Even if FSR 4.0 does achieve better adaption, DLSS may still be easy enough to integrate into cross-platform releases as it's a general model. That said, given that it's a general model perhaps FSR 4.0 continues to go this ""game-specific"" model path instead of ""general model"" and give developers more game-specific control over the FSR 4.0 model. Albeit, that could end up as more of a drawback especially for more indie titles.   I don't think you're going to need to worry about it any time soon and it's something that we've really had no indication of seeing,.. but if such models *expand* beyond simple frame sharpening and generation & into experimental generative, I'd expect FSR's positioning in console adaption to potentially give whichever model dominates console a massive edge? For instance, how long will it be before we see game-specific trained generative FSR models replace things with unique, AI generated assets. Example: using generative model to create 360 sprites derived from an extremely high poly models to populate many variants of stumps in a drab forest, without ever needing more than a flat plane. If that's a feature which ever becomes feasible, that's where I'd watch for FSR's game-specific models & their positioning on consoles to possibly surge ahead (as you wouldn't want to train two of these, just one). But again, there's no indication that this is currently in development or seriously being pursued - but instead something that could be on the horizon.",Neutral

AMD,"\>as if you cant find ""actual sources"" that say that the 9060 xt out performs the 5060 ti  You can't find any ""actual source"", as in something reputable and not ""ask AI"", that shows that 9060XT outperforms 5060Ti on average. Yes, even on 1440p. Yes, even without upscaling.",Negative
AMD,"The 5060 ti might be a stronger card but it loses to the 9060 xt in many games at 1440p with no ai upscaling im not a person who hates the 5060 ti , actually the only downside is the price other than that its pretty close to the 9060 xt",Negative
AMD,apart from the fatal flaw in their engine with nvidia cards they have had trouble fixing for a year+ they even added a feature that saves your gamestate and immedietly spins up a new instance to replace it as it crashes as a workaround,Negative
AMD,No I'm not talking about frame gen. I was more meaning forcing fsr4 upscaling in games that only have fsr 2 or 3. I thought they added that as an option on the driver level.,Neutral
AMD,"You can still enable it on Linux with OptiScaler, but on my 7600xt it increased frametimes by almost 10ms compared to FSR3.1 which is under 1ms.   So it ""works"" in the strictest sense but it's not good, and disabling it definitely was not an arbitrary decision.",Neutral
AMD,"Wait, what? I can switch to DLSS 4 on path of exile 2 for example?  brb googling.",Neutral
AMD,I know about that... does it work in anti-cheat games,Neutral
AMD,"You are a reddit youtube parrot and frankly i am wasting my time on you.  I can afford to try both, none of the crap your mention happened in the last 2 games i forced the latest 310.4 preset both of DLAA and DLSS Quality, there is 0 blur, 0 ghosting in UE5 games and BF6, Diablo 4,POE2 and so on any game that i can force DLSS4 latest preset on.  While with FSR its unplayable and clearly way more blurry.  You can parrot whatever crap you read and hear, some of us can use our eyes and can afford to check for ourselves.  FSR4 is a 200% improvement over FSR3 but its not there yet, and it cant combat DLAA in any of the games i play, quite the opposite, they are practically unplayable if i use FSR cause i can tell the blur comparisons.  A standing still picture of a single player game where i can guess its from DigitalFoundry or you copied their format/showcasing, does not impress me.  I am not gonna convince you and you are not gonna convince me, i can afford the extra 100$ to buy Nvidia and DLSS works better than FSR in the games i care to play, its not there yet.",Negative
AMD,Prove it?,Neutral
AMD,No. The driver implementation is AFMF. FSR4 has to be coded into the game or use a mod like Optiscaler,Neutral
AMD,"Nah, that was Nvidia, but the game needs to have DLSS of some kind already implemented, and then you can just change the version at the driver level.  Like an older game that only has DLSS 1 for example, you could potentially push that all the way up to the transformer model DLSS 4.",Neutral
AMD,"You can enable it on Windows too, you just need the compiled DLL and optiscaler",Neutral
AMD,"Yup if it supports some version of DLSS already, in the NVIDIA app, go to the “graphics” section, then on the left find the game you want and click on it, then in the middle scroll all the way down to the bottom and you will find the options there.",Neutral
AMD,"There are no popular YouTube videos covering DLSS 4 AA issues. I uploaded those comparisons, and I've been talking about how bad DLSS 4 looks at native since March. All the comparisons I provided were taken in motion.  You said you can afford to make such comparisons, and yet it's me providing them for everyone to see, not you. I'm on Nvidia as well, and I have to use OptiScaler in every single game to get good anti-aliasing. With DLSS 4 in DLAA mode, shimmering is so bad, it causes nausea and headache.  Man, if that's how you ""use your eyes"", and you actually don't see pixel junk and trails in motion with DLSS 4 at native - god bless you, don't start looking for it, enjoy your games. But I can't play like that, it looks too bad.",Negative

AMD,Probably what I was thinking of. I wonder if AMD will implement something similar.,Neutral
AMD,Countless benchmarks show that the 9060 xt is better and many people who are more experienced than me aand you say that the 9060 xt is better and i didnt say that asking ai is the best way to find out the performance of a graphics card did i so if you can do more research and come back maybe your gonna get the right facts buddy also didnt i say that the 9060 xt is similar in performance without ai upscaling? The 5060 ti doesnt offer more than what the 9060 xt can give,Neutral
AMD,\>Countless benchmarks show that the 9060 xt  You still haven't shown a single one tho.  \>maybe your gonna get the right facts   You mean I should disregard those multiple reputable sources I've already posted and find those that support YOUR agenda?  Dude... Lame.,Neutral

AMD,"The US75 uses QLC flash, which has low durability and becomes noticeably slower after a few years. The G50 would have been fine.",Negative
AMD,For $220 definitely worth it,Positive
AMD,"$220 is a steal. I would pay up to $300 for one. I couldn't find one for less than $400 so I just bought a used 5700x3d for around $200 since it's only 5% slower. The extra cache makes it all worth it, you'll notice a difference.",Neutral
AMD,Do you have ddr4 ram already?,Neutral
AMD,Rocking it with 9070XT. No issues at 1440p whatsoever. Having a blast so far.,Positive
AMD,"If you can get it that cheap, that's a pretty good deal IMHO. It's what I run in my PC.",Positive
AMD,If you have the memory kit at least then it could be worth it.  If you don't then a r5-7600 with a $100-$120 b650 motherboard would be my pick.  That'll be about $300 without memory either way.,Neutral
AMD,For that price yes.,Neutral
AMD,5800x3d? Definitely. Especially at that price.,Positive
AMD,"5700x3d owner here - About $200 is the max I recommend paying for that CPU, but the 5800x3d is really hard to find for so and is a bit stronger performer. If it's functional, I'd grab it in a heartbeat.",Positive
AMD,Thank you!,Positive
AMD,Yes I have 16GB of DDR4 2133,Neutral
AMD,Thank you!,Positive
AMD,That's not enough for the 5800x3d,Negative
AMD,"That doesn't make sense. RAM might not be enough for a certain use case, not the CPU",Negative
AMD,"5080 can make sense in certain workloads, but usually the 5070 ti is like 90% there for 75% of the price.  As for the rest of your part selection... I think you're paying a few hundred on aesthetics... Like a good 1/3 of the price is just aesthetics.",Neutral
AMD,Monitor the RAM prices and consider that in black Friday there will be lot of people purchasing so the price will raise 🙄🤔,Neutral
AMD,"If you're going just off of compute resources, the 5070 Ti is only 83% of the way there.  They do share the same VRAM subsystem (16GB of GDDR7 w/ 256-bit bus), though.  Setting that nitpicking aside, I also think of the 5070 Ti and 5080 much like I did the 3060 Ti and 3070 from five years ago in that the higher-end model of the pair just isn't a good enough value (on a $/FPS basis) to justify its higher cost.",Neutral
AMD,9060 XT 16GB,Neutral
AMD,"A520 boards don't like overclocking. 5000 series X3D CPUs don't like overclocking. Match made :D  6GB video card may be an issue? Depends on what you like to play. In general, GPU would be where you probably want to pour all the extra budget you can stomach. Before the CPU even. If the total price is your max budget, maybe consider a slightly cheaper CPU and a slightly stringer GPU.  Since AM4 is now truely end of life upgradability later doesn't really matter, it'll be a full re-build for your next rig since you won't be able to get better CPUs or more memory anymore. Which should drive you in one of two directions: either go as cheap as you can while still getting what you need from the system, or max it out with a 5800X3D and a 9060XT or thereabouts (9070/9070XT would probably see some slow down from the 5800X3D).  On the mainboard: I can't find VRM specs for it on the MSI homepage. From the pictures it looks like it might be only four phases with discreet MOSFET instead of power stages. That's not a lot of power delivery, but then again  even a 5950X only pulls 105W, so that might be fine. But look up some reviews.  What is also weird in the spec, it only lists Windows 10 support, not Windows 11. Very likely this is just a case of the website not having been updated, it's not an old enough chipset to lack TPM 2.0 or Secure Boot support.",Negative
AMD,I have this build already and it's working pretty well. I'm just thinking if one day I want to upgrade how to do it. Thanks for the tips.,Positive
AMD,Always go for more ram so long as it's not insanely high $ more ram will help with caching.,Positive
AMD,"For music production it would be better to have more RAM, so at least 32GB would be recommended.",Neutral
AMD,The GPU is listed as 300 watt and cpu is 120 so it should be plenty of power,Positive
AMD,That's cutting it pretty close though. You need headroom for spikes and other components. 850w would be way safer.,Neutral
AMD,"$1200 for a cutdown RX 580 and a Ryzen 3 4100? Jesus you got scammed hard.   But I would get a new PC if I were you (as if you did upgrade your current PC).   You would have upgrade your CPU for sure (4100 isn’t great and will be a limiting factor), GPU as well and RAM later on (16GB is fine but 32GB is ideal in 2025).   Better off starting new (too many MAJOR things to upgrade).",Negative
AMD,"I would build new in your position, though you could keep the 1tb drive if you wanted.",Neutral
AMD,You paid 1200 for this? You know that you got scammed very very hard yeah? This is a decade old graphics card and a low end processor.   That’s a used 400$ PC….,Negative
AMD,"With these crazy RAM prices, I'd check whether your MOBO can take a 5700X3D or not. Maybe you'll need to update the BIOS to make it up to the CPU upgrade. If it does, try to find one decently priced. That should be enough to be paired with most newer GPUs. You'll probably need a better CPU heat dissipation solution, like one of those Thermalright Phantom. Even if you can't find a 5700X3D there are many inexpensive AM4 CPUs that can take something like a 9070XT GPU just fine. Finally, if you're looking for a beefier GPU you'll be needing a better PSU, 550W is quite a little.",Neutral
AMD,"Holy shit they still have the ryzen 4100 pc for sale for the same price but with 1650 instead of 580.... never ever go to that website again, those systems are way over prices.... custom build they want 420 for a 3070...",Negative

AMD,"depends? are you trying to run AAA games or indie games? because if you are running indie games that aren't super intensive, you should be fine.  BUT on the other end of the spectrum, if you want to play AAA games on mid to high settings... you might need a new one.  also you said you got that in 2023 for 1200 dollars? yeah you definitely overpaid.",Neutral

Also are you using any monitoring tool? MSI Afterburner or HWiNFO? Can you check if the GPU and VRAM limits are being hit?,Negative
AMD,"> What games are you talking about?   It's mostly games like cyberpunk, but I can get most of them running on their lowest settings. I couldn't get Deadloop to get it's VRAM usage low enough, but it still ran fine even with that.   This is also in large part me trying to prepare for the steam frame, since it seems optimized for PCVR, even though it *can* do standalone play.   I'm not using any monitors besides task manager right now, I'll take a look next time I get on the game",Neutral
AMD,"Those games should run at decent framerate on a Ryzen 5500, you have enough RAM, so the main issue should be the GPU, everything else should work well.  What is the budget you have for the upgrades? And are the games installed on a SSD or HDD?",Positive
AMD,"Two SSDs, a 1 & a 2 terabyte Samsung drive. Not at my computer right now to check the models, but they're both pretty modern drives. The 2 Terabyte I added on last year, it was a Christmas gift.   As for budget, it depends on the value I'm getting, but 100% below 700$, 500$ is pushing it.   The other commenters are mentioning the 9060xt, I'll take a look at that one",Positive
AMD,"Ahh ok, that's excellent. Any SSD, SATA or NVMe would be perfect. Some games have a hard time running from a HDD, that's why I asked, but having any SSD for games is perfect.  Do you have a max budget for the upgrade? because depending on the GPU you go with, you might have to change the 550W PSU as well.",Positive
AMD,"I'm not against upgrading the PSU since it's gonna be something I'll end up needing to do long term, and a PSU upgrade will probably last me a lot longer than any other part, but I don't wanna spend much more than $100 on a new PSU if I can get away with it. With black Friday coming up though, I'll probably be just fine. Any suggestions for PSU and GPU while I have you?",Neutral
AMD,"For less than $100 you can get the [Montech Century II 850W ATX 3.1](https://talospc.com/product/montech-century-ii-atx-3-1-850w-psu/), that is probably THE best PSU in that price range, A- Tier, so good high'ish-end PSU, and very affordable for what it is (ATX 3.1 850W). Everything else in that price range is either 650W or 750W.  A few others in the $100-120 range are the [MSI A850GL PCIE5](https://talospc.com/product/msi-mag-a850gl-pcie5-850w-psu/), [be quiet!

For GPU, [at least something in the 5060 Ti or 9060 XT range of performance would be a really nice upgrade over a 2060](https://youtu.be/-LAH5vh-Cpg?t=507), from the [TechPowerUp relative performance charts](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-2060.c3310) they should be a bit over 2x the performance of 2060.  You can get a [Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB ](https://talospc.com/product-category/hardware/gpu/amd-radeon/rx-9000-series/rx-9060-xt-16gb/?orderby=price)around $350-380, and a [GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB ](https://talospc.com/product-category/hardware/gpu/nvidia-geforce/rtx-5000-series/rtx-5060-ti-16gb/?orderby=price)around $420-450. Those are the first two models (new) worth looking into.  * BTW, both GPUs have a similar TDP to the RTX 2060 (160-180W), so they should work with the current PSU without issues. * So i would only upgrade PSU if you are going for something that uses more power.  If you have a higher budget, literally anything up to an $1000 5080 would work well on a 850W PSU, but a cheaper GPU + CPU upgrade would make more sense.  If you are buying a used GPU, at least 10GB would be nice, avoid the 8GB ones for AAA games, especially if you are playing at 1440p. If you are doing that, you can use the TechPowerUp charts to see what would be a nice upgrade, compared to buying new.",Positive
AMD,"That's really good for that PSU, the next teir is $20 more and 1050W, do I have much reason to get that much power if I never plan on getting a meta PC? Is the power consumption of modern parts trending upwards quickly enough it justify it?",Positive
AMD,"Probably not. The 16-pin cable is limited to 600W, and you need a 5090 to draw that much  A 5060Ti is 2x the performance of a 2060, and draws about the same power.  A 9800X3D is very power efficient, way less power than something like a 9950X or 14900K, and way better gaming performance.   For gaming, you won't need that much power. For productivity, you might if you go with flagship hardware",Neutral
AMD,"productivity? I'm doing gamedev on Godot as a hobby, does that change the question?   Edit: also, I'm planning on switching from windows 11 to a Linux distro (probably SteamOS) when I make the upgrade, which may also affect the answer.   Edit 2: looking at the models, it looks like the Reaper or the Challenger are my best bet for price and performance. The Reaper is $20 cheaper than the Challenger, but the Challenger has 80 MHz more. Is .25c per MHz good enough value to take the Challenger over the reaper?",Neutral
AMD,"Temperature issues can be fixed. If you're still happy with how it performs, theres no point in upgrading anything  What are the temperatures on the gpu?",Neutral
AMD,My 6800 was always a bit hot until I undervolted it. AncientGameplays on YouTube has plenty of guides how to undervolt AMD. If heat is the only concern I’d start there.,Neutral
AMD,It was going up above 70 degrees c. Not critical but did make the rig feel hot.,Neutral
AMD,70 is in really good territory lol. Unless it’s ripping closer to 90°C you shouldn’t be worried about a thing.,Positive
AMD,70 is after I’ve turned graphics down though. Dunno what they were before other than ‘ow that’s hot’,Neutral
AMD,Well don’t touch it lol. Even if it was at 80° that’s still entirely fine.,Positive
AMD,I mean yeah it’s not damaging but as this is only power was simulator it shouldn’t be taxing it this much,Negative
AMD,"That’s irrelevant, the game can still use resources whether you think so or not- you don’t have any issues",Negative
AMD,"Good to know, I’ll put off the upgrade for now",Positive
AMD,"Like the other guy said, you’re better off buying an am5 ddr5 motherboard and cpu. It’s new gen and you would want something to hold in the future. They’re more or less the same price",Neutral
AMD,Don't buy an AM4 based system in 2025. Go with AM5.  You can look at something like [this](https://www.newegg.com/skytech-gaming-desktop-pcs-amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-32gb-ddr5-2tb-nvme-ssd-st-azure3-1747-w-al-white/p/3D5-000Z-002C5) for reference.  And don't buy Windows,Neutral
AMD,Replace 7900 xt with a cheaper TX 9070 XT,Neutral
AMD,"Great case choice, but but may a recommend to take the regular pop air and 2 140mm fans separately? I think the front just looks better on the regular sized ones when you get larger fans. Plus your GPU has more clearance, you have more choices in GPU brackets and the larger fans let in more air.",Positive

AMD,"Every reason over it.   Better resell value, not much performance difference.   Newer architecture.   New version of RDNA.   Better optimization.   Lower power for some applications.   I get the VRAM but you aren’t hurrying at 16gb unless you have a specific need for VRAM.",Positive
AMD,I’d spend less on case and more on SSD,Neutral
AMD,"Also the motherboard seems like you could do a bit better, perhaps less bells and whistles but no compromise on performance just because of stupid RGB.",Negative
AMD,I don't understand why people are still benchmarking with shadow and rise of the tomb raider... I mean shadow is 8 years old game. Rise was 2015 game..   Does it even support direct storage and rebar,Negative
AMD,"In my case, i choose games that i have some access (Gamepass/EA Access + Giveway from GOG, Epic, Microsoft, Ubisoft, etc) AND that have built-in benchmark tools, like Rise and Shadow, as they could run automatically with the same preset while i could do something on my phone, notebook or Nintendo Switch. So i not ""waste time"" looking at the benchmark while my computer was doing it.  I like to test older games, because i have a huge backlog of games (one of the reasons to choose the RTX 5060, as it has the performance of an 2080TI, 2080Super and 3070 that was a monsters back int time) and that, for example, made me remove Intel Arc boards from any option, as they only look for newer games. I didn't post here, but many older games i can run 4k ultra with 60fps+ with that setup, like Need For Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered, Skyrim, Metro Redux and other games. Playing 4k 60fps with everything on with that board for me is a huge win.  And, for me, that matters too as i only played until now the Tomb Raider 2013 on Xbox and want to play both games, so looking the performance in both scenarios it's important for me.  Shadow of Tomb Raider, although it's 8 years old, as you can see, with everything on the RTX 5060 struggle to run it, they have RT Shadows implemented, and they have support for FSR, DLSS and XeSS. A great choice for benchmarking what you want to check...   Same board, I went from a scenario (5600GT @ PCI-E 3.0) with sub 60fps average (55) with 95% at 41fps and 34fps min to a scenario (5700X @ PCI-E 4.0) with 78fps average with 95% at 58fps and minimun of 55.The average of the 5600GT is the minimum of the 5700X (not from the raw force but just for upgrading the PCI-E). Both 1440p native and DLSS. This leave room to run it at 4k with RT and everything on.  I put the Rise of Tomb Raider too because was installed when i benchmark my GT1030 vs the onboard Vega7 from the 5600GT, and for fun i tested it too to see the gains from the 1030 to the 5060 lol.",Neutral
AMD,What was your budget? I'm not a fan of mid and lower asrock boards and I feel like you could do better on the GPU a bit,Negative
AMD,The 6600 is still pretty solid in comp titles tbh still getting 140 fps 1080p in performance on the new cod and 120 in battlefield but the biggest thing is what games does op want to play,Positive
AMD,"I had around 4200 in cash (Brazilian currency). I bought most of it in the heat of the moment because of Black Friday, but I haven't bought the GPU yet. I'm very undecided. Do you have any recommendations? I got a bit discouraged reading some things about ""if it's your first computer, go straight to AM5"".",Neutral
AMD,"I'm not a big fan of competitive games. I think I'd enjoy playing something like Red Dead Redemption or even Age of Empires, and some RPGs too.  But for the first one, I didn't want anything grandiose. Just something that could run some things.",Negative
AMD,You can definitely run a lot on a 6600 still you may need to fudge the card a bit on some settings for new titles but my wife had a 5600 with a 6600 and had no issues with any game until I got her an ultra wide then I upgraded her to a 7800xt,Neutral
AMD,"Thank you, I was really worried about this! Could you recommend a processor? I was thinking about a 5500X3D but I don't think my motherboard will come with the update to support it. Or can I just keep it at 5600?",Neutral
AMD,Not familiar with the 5500x3d as it’s not sold easily in my region but I’d imagine no issues if your bios is up to date and can use a 5600,Neutral
AMD,"Honestly im into it as long as pricing is good, for 250 its a good budget card though id like to see it for less as a 9060xt 8gb can be had for 275atm. 220 would be amazing and would help bring people into gaming for a much cheaper price, theyd have access to fsr4 too. Itd drive down b580 pricing also. Rising tide lifts all boats situation",Positive
AMD,5050 is a better card in my opinion,Positive
AMD,"probably won't drive down b580 pricing, margins are already razor thin. Honestly nothing wrong with using 8gb vram cards if the price is right, only problem with these cards is that they're usually overpriced",Negative
AMD,No pricing on this one. It's OEM exclusive.,Neutral
AMD,Yup no bad GPUs just bad prices,Negative
AMD,How? This RX 9060 competes directly with RTX 5060 within the same or less price bracket.   Your comment seems like ragebait,Neutral
AMD,The 9060 will possibly only be $10 more than the 5050 if it goes on sale outside of OEMs. It’d be a horrible idea buying that GPU.,Negative
AMD,Only if you are a braindead Nvidia fanboy. lol,Neutral
AMD,You're high,Neutral
AMD,REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE,Neutral
AMD,🤡🤡🤡,Neutral
AMD,I mean if they dont lower margins then they wont sell. Im not saying theyll make money but they have to sell yk,Negative
AMD,Ofc but in the off chance the do release it,Neutral
AMD,That’s why getting 5050 for less and same VRAM and DLSS make sense,Neutral
AMD,It will only go on sale second hand. This card will NOT be sold firsthand on diy builder markets.,Neutral
AMD,So you feel it is a better value card  Not a better card  It depends on the price I suppose but a cost per frame analysis is hard as it's only in prebuilts,Neutral
AMD,"Will Zen 6 be the final generation for AM5? In that case, I will finally upgrade from a 5900x",Neutral

AMD,Tensor cores…? On a Radeon GPU?  I think this kind of mistakes are not reasonable on specialized press.  What a POS.,Neutral
AMD,I would honestly be happy if AMD dumped all efforts to push ray tracing and focused on GPUs that ran more efficiently.,Positive
AMD,Zen7 is rumoured to be on am5 and it kind of makes sense considering timelines for ddr6 ram.,Neutral
AMD,Looking like Zen 7 will still use ddr5,Neutral
AMD,"There’s a rumour that Zen7 might come to AM5. It’s just a rumour but it indicates that AMD is still deciding.  I think part of it comes from Zen7 & DDR6 release dates and the uncertainty of DDR6 prices and spec at launch.  DDR5 launch spec were slower than DDR4 because of similar or just a little bitter speeds but loose timings. And DDR6 might come with a similar problem as well.  I’m totally in for Zen7 being released for both AM5 & AM6, not just to make AM5 last longer but to give consumers the option, especially that going AM6 will be expensive for early adopters making Zen7 adoption slow if it was AM6 exclusive.  As for AM6, I really really hope it comes with extra PCIe lanes, like 4-8 lanes, I would hope for 12-16 but it not realistic unless they limit those 12-16 lanes to high end chipsets only (the E series) and can target workstation/server grade motherboards too. Currently AM5 high end, server & workstation grade motherboards are boring because of this, and the only way to get more PCIe lanes is to jump to Threadripper which is a very big jump considering how much more expensive it became compared to first generation Threadripper.",Neutral
AMD,"Nice! Sitting on the 5900x myself, tempted a few times but reading about the 9000 burns and stuff - no thanks I'll keep this beast.",Positive
AMD,I think i'm getting on Zen 6 and was about to get a x870 board in advance but it looks like Zen 6 will have a new chipset and that's probably actually going to be impactful on this processor. I won't bank on Zen 7 being on AM5.,Neutral
AMD,Most likely.,Neutral
AMD,"Considering zen 6 is most likely coming in 2026 from their roadmaps, they probably are still only in the early stages of zen 7 (at least the desktop variants which while the core dies are the same or similar, the IO die is completely different). I'd wager they have an idea of which platform they would like to stay on, but it could change within the next year or so before they send tape outs to TSMC. That being said, I think they'll stick with AM5 for zen 7 while zen 8 (or whatever they end up calling the architecture) will be the switch to DDR6. DDR6 is supposedly arriving in 2027 which doesn't leave much time for a whole new platform to be developed for 2028/2029, even if AMD started in 2026.  That's also not including potential delays for the DDR6 spec.",Neutral
AMD,Seriously. Unless they magically show they can match what NVIDIA is doing its just that.,Negative
AMD,"Brute forcing everything doesn't make sense. There are areas where you want to use compressions, approximations etc. Ai can help with these. The important part is to use it where it makes sense.",Neutral
AMD,For developers who want to pay less to develop shitty games.  You can take AI frame generation and the performance hit of raytracing and shove it.,Negative
AMD,Thats funny because that's not what this sub was saying for the last 4 years. They were saying Ray Tracing isnt worth it and a dumb endevor shilled by NVIDIA.,Negative
AMD,AI generation so they name them after monsters? interesting,Neutral
AMD,"They use matrix cores, also the new hardware features were disclosed by AMD and Sony already in a joint video. They will now have hardware BVH traversal on RDNA4’s successor in the form of “radiance cores”. ML continues to improve with neural arrays. Plus there’s a new compression scheme to improve memory performance they are referring to as universal compression.",Neutral

AMD,those will be over 3k cost and req between 500 to 800 watts.  fyi you can vm multi cards in 1 card. nvidia does the same.,Neutral
AMD,"There's a lot of options for keeping performance on DDR5 for a while.  They could implement some kind of consumer standard for MRDIMMs.  They could add another stack of V-Cache.  Heck, we might even see some improvements via 3D DRAM if that becomes a thing in the next year or two.",Positive
AMD,Might be they release a AM5+ with PCIe6 and more USB4. I also think AM6 will be when DDR6 is ready.,Neutral
AMD,And probably still not be able to get anywhere near the frequencies DDR5 supports,Neutral
AMD,"Which DDR generation it supports will be dependent on the IO-die, not the CCD.  AMD could make a Zen 2 chip with DDR5 support if they wanted to, or a Zen 5 chip with DDR4.",Neutral
AMD,A rumor from an unreliable source is not indication of anything.,Negative
AMD,"Why not, ddr6 won't come before 2029, zen7 is 2028 most likely",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, AI upscaling like FSR4 and dlss is one of the big actually useful use cases for AI that I encounter in my day to day. FSR4 is good enough that I'm happy to play with 50-60% resolution in most games which is an insane performance boost. And imho it looks better than the blur from cheap AA so you get even more free performance from not needing AA and the image looks better.  And apparently there's a bunch more stuff you can upscale with ai, I saw a demo where it upscaled indidual textures and my understanding is you can do similar things with shadows and lightmaps.  I feel like 5 years from now modern rendering is going to be some crazy black magic with AI upscaling all over the place that allows you to cheat and only have to render like 20% of the stuff you'd have to do with normal rendering.",Positive
AMD,"Thats valid, they just keep pushing ai this ai that, and i have yet to see any real benefit in my opinion.",Negative
AMD,Ty!,Neutral
AMD,"Doesn’t work for me neither. Had issues with a different link today as well, and I never really do. Maybe it’s a Reddit app issue on mobile 🤷‍♂️",Negative
AMD,Zen 6 already will have some memory controller changes as 2-DIMM motherboards got revisions earlier this year to be able to boot it.,Neutral
AMD,"I can see 9000-10000 mhz ram being a sweet spot for zen7, that would probably be enough of a performance increase two gens from now.",Positive
AMD,">I also think AM6 will be when DDR6 is ready.  I agree. That'd line up with how AMD's been doing things since the AM2 days.  >Might be they release a AM5+ with PCIe6 and more USB4  Given what they've been doing since Ryzen 3000 series, i think i'd be more likely that they do it as a chipset thing, a la 500 series chipsets supporting PCIe 4.0 on AM4. You could use Zen 5000 series chips on 300 series chipsets with the appropiate BIOS version, in some cases, you'd also lose support for older parts, and the newer CPU may become limited to the PCIe version of the Motherboard (3000 or newer CPUs being limited to PCIe 3.0 on 400 or older boards)   AM5 may go a simillar route, the upgrade path is one of the things that are attractive about AMD so I don't think they'll revise the socket until DDR6 is a thing, and they move onto AM6. Before Ryzen, there was some compatibility between regular AM2 and AM3 sockets/CPUs and the + versions, but it was a bit of a mess. I don't think AMD would want to go back to that.   The 800 and 600 series chipsets are confusing enough already. B850 supports PCIe 5 while B840 doesn't and B650E does   What i could see happening if Zen 7 comes out before DDR6: 900 Series chipset with PCIe 6 and more USB 4 lanes (, as long as the CPU supports it) still on the AM5 socket.",Neutral
AMD,That is a possibility yeah,Neutral
AMD,We'll see. A lot can happen,Neutral
AMD,"Sounds fine to me. Unless AMD is showing significant issues that are a cause of ram bandwidth in relation to their counterparts, I see no reason why they need to be using max ddr5 frequencies. If they're still getting the performance, saves everybody who builds a system money not having to buy the top specs stuff",Neutral
AMD,"AM5 can already get above [10,000 MT/s](https://valid.x86.fr/7z1sg6).",Neutral
AMD,What? Zen4 and 5 can already do it...,Neutral
AMD,"Yea no shit.  What makes Zen 7 an AM5 chip is the release date. DDR6 won't be ready until 2029. Zen 7 will be released before then, and AMD is not going to make another socket just to change it a year later",Negative
AMD,"If multiple sources leaked the same rumour, then there's some base to this rumour, again I already mentioned it in my previous reply that it's still a rumour, but indicates that AMD is still deciding Zen7 things.",Neutral
AMD,It's not just that.,Negative
AMD,You're woefully misinformed if you think 6000Mt/s the highest DDR5 can go,Neutral
AMD,"Can you show me this rumor having more than one actual source.  So not just two places reporting based on the same rumor?    And even then, it's still not a sign that a rumor has any base.  Plenty of rumormongers play off each other's rumors for clout, even when there's no genuine source for the information.",Negative
AMD,"Maybe not, but that line of thinking still really bothers me. lol  It's wild how much people dont realize how easily manipulated they are if they think some 'rumor' is indication of something being true.    We desperately need critical thinking lessons in schools growing up.  And not just one, but new and refresher lessons in every couple grades at least.  It's a skill and it needs to be reinforced and practiced.",Negative

AMD,"There is critical thinking behind it, no worries. Otherwise I agree.",Neutral
AMD,"If you think 8000 is the most DDR5 can do  you have no idea what you're talking about  AMD hasn't been able to deliver competitive IO since before Bulldozer, haters gonna block because they're incapable of debate",Negative
AMD,"Wasn't talking about you, but the original poster who said that a 'rumor' is somehow proof that AMD is deliberating on it.",Neutral

AMD,"With rdna 3 being barely capable of decent rt (and its missing the hardware for it), fair enough.   I personally wont sidegrade my xtx to a 9070xt and lose vram for it so i guess ill wait for what next gpus are there.  Im expecting silly prices so nVidia is most likely still out of the question",Negative
AMD,"I think that the 7000 series will get official FSR4 support, both will be locked out Redstone's advanced features in the future. 6000 series lack the AI accelerators so expecting FSR4 support for these series was simply doomed from the start.

AMD,"I have a 7900XTX as well but most of these comments saying you go ""team green next gen"" are a bit rediculous.  We dont even know how next generation GPUs look like.  Who knows if AMD will be offering what you want at all or if Nvidia is perhaps even skipping a year of gaming GPUs due to GDDR7 issues.  You should make your choice when we know what we have, not out of frustration of a problem that is due to architecture and was known even before FSR4 was released.",Negative
AMD,Damn when did AMD get as greedy as Nvidia without the performance or software to back it up?   I’m being serious. Nvidia has at least managed to backport a good amount of its software suite all the way down to the 20 series. AMD meanwhile….,Negative
AMD,"People are expecting different things from Redstone. This should the ML solutions and the only hardware capable of it is 9000+ in the initial version.  AMD already did the translation that allows the last gen and older cards to run ML solutions with some penalities.

AMD,"Same here. I was patient with AMD last time, not again. Team green just offers too much now, even if more expensive.",Negative
AMD,"Right.  It is honestly driving me crazy.  I wouldnt be annoyed by a few comments mentioning it, but a scan of this entire comment reply section is FILLED with people that fundamentally did not understand how far behind AMD was with AI features until RDNA4.   AMD was ALWAYS the raster and dollar-per-frame king as a means to compete with nvidia.  But as AI has proven itself to be the way forward, the sting of having bought in before AMD matured in that part was always going to come at some point.  But beyond that, I was hoping to find some comments detailing out what FSR4 Redstone could mean, and instead its just a wall of complaints that it - whatever *it* even is - isnt coming to their card (which in a way I do get, but cmon man.  enough is enough, lets talk about the actual feature set.  its going to be on this and future series of cards going forward).",Negative
AMD,Its a slightly different story when it's been clearly demonstrated that RDNA3 can support these features and AMD is simply electing not to release them.,Negative
AMD,"This sub is giga overmoderated, quite often posts are waiting 5h+ until they are approved. So it shows x hours old post but only just got visible for everyone",Negative
AMD,Every post has at least a 6 hour delay or something. I think the mods have a (very slow) approval process that is killing the engagement. Most people have already seen this topic on other hardware subs,Negative
AMD,The mods have basically killed this subreddit,Neutral
AMD,I find the r/radeon sub to be busier though not necessarily better.   A fair bit more activity on the announcement video over there.

AMD,380k weekly visitors... doesn't seem dead to me. Maybe nobody feels like commenting on the topic?,Negative
AMD,"I don't know if I should even be happy about this news, not to mention upvoting this.",Negative
AMD,I wouldn't count on it but maybe who knows. Linux community will port it before AMD and it should work with both RDNA2/3,Neutral
AMD,I am just starting to use Linux. Are the amd drivers easier to install and use than the nvidia ones? Multiple versions? Better support?,Positive
AMD,"It is because the 7000 series and before lack the built in AI accelerators that the 9000 series has (which supposedly is a massive improvement over the first generation).  The model that was leaked and that you can run on your 7800xt seems to be a less efficient method that essentially emulates what is happening natively on RDNA4 - but it is still better than FSR3, and will more than likely get official support announced later down the road.   The fact that we are getting a *core feature* for RDNA4 nearly a year after it launched for the hardware the architecture was literally designed to take advantage of should tell you enough as to why older cards are lagging behind in support for new features that those cards were never designed from the ground up to take advantage of.   It will come - AMD likely understands that it cannot afford to completely jettison support of prior generations.  But it is less of a priority given that the 9000 series seems to be their springboard to getting back into direct competition with nvidia.   Which, cmon now - they havent been for a few generations, especially after DLSS has proven itself to be the key winning feature over the pure raster performance of AMD.",Neutral
AMD,As greedy as Nvidia? Hah!   Someone didn't pay attention over the past decade.,Negative
AMD,iGPUs struggle with anisotropic filtering. You’re going to be dead by the time iGPUs can handle raytracing well enough.,Negative
AMD,you bet fellow 9000 series enjoyer.  I am glad I picked up the series that AMD finally got right - and they realized that by letting everyone know that they aint supporting their old shit that was built from the ground up worse than ngreedia.,Positive
AMD,"As an RX 7900 XTX owner, I feel the same. Especially since we all know it's possible to have a decent upscaler, or even the 'original' one (FP8), through instruction emulation, like the open-source community did with Linux drivers. (For those who don't know, the FP8 model can also run on RDNA 3 pretty well. Before the INT8 model leaked, I was playing some titles on Nobara for that reason.)",Positive
AMD,I’m already very fed up with my 7900XTX due to how much it crashes. Feels like I just burned this money  strongly leaning team green for my next card at this rate,Negative
AMD,"Or just realise neither are your friends and pick the best for you  For me the choice is clearly always AMD for now, for you it might be different",Neutral
AMD,Nvidia gatekeeps features every generation just about. They're not any better.,Negative
AMD,"As someone who went through two melted cards, you can’t pay me to go team green until they fix that.  Features or not.",Negative
AMD,Same. Im an AMD fan but no reason not to go Green next round.   6000 and 7000 have been excellent for me since they dropped. I had a 6800XT early and 7900XTX since it launched and they've been great. I want the best of the best next round,Positive
AMD,"I might do the same thing. My 6870 was decent in its day. My RX 580 is still hanging in on my backup PC. This 7900 XT should last a few more good years, before it goes in the backup PC.",Positive
AMD,"And what, ""team Green"" has been even more restrictive with their features.",Negative
AMD,"you still have FSR3 and any other upscalers that are implemented by developers, like TSR.  FSR4 uses hardware to accelerate it that RDNA3 simply does not have. I'm not sure why everyone is so upset about this.  The 7900 XTX is powerful enough to run things at native resolution if you turn off raytracing anyway.",Neutral
AMD,Because Nvidia dont lock software improvements behind new SKUs of hardware ? Lol,Negative
AMD,Kind of reminds me of this political comic from years ago. Just substitute political parties with AMD and Nvidia.  https://i.redd.it/bkc228txh42g1.gif,Neutral
AMD,You bought the wrong card to care about fake frames.,Negative
AMD,"Yes it's enough me, it's why I'm waiting for next generation. But In general I upgrade my GPU every 2-3 gens  with all the ray tracing (some mandatory), other games relying on upscaling for 60fps gameplay and  now features being only for new cards. I'm willing to upgrade next gen.   Im keeping my 5800x3d as long as possible no problems there. I also play at 3440x1440 and shoot for 120fps that's the sweet spot for me.",Positive
AMD,If AMD were working on FSR4 for older gen cards then I would expect them to at least let people know that they are working on it. It's pretty bad marketing to let people get upset and move to Nvidia.,Negative
AMD,"Yeah ray regeneration isnt worth it on rdna 3 anyways, but theyre not even working on bringing fsr4 to rdna3, they shouldve just put rdna3 into maintenance too",Negative
AMD,If they don't they will lose a lot of loyal customers that have been patient with team Red despite being behind the tech curve.,Negative
AMD,"Id like to know what part of the ""new features"" they were talking about when the branched rdna3 with rdna4 drivers",Neutral
AMD,"i like that they said earlier on that ML wasn't essential for Redstone, and yet they still choose to lock it behind this generation. I'm hoping this is just for now, and maybe they roll out FSR4 support for RDNA3 when they drop this feature set.",Neutral
AMD,"Similar debate with me at the end of the last year 4070ti or 7900GRE.  While I do need and use some of the tech NV offers, I went for the better raster price/performance. But next upgrade the gaming and productivity technology NV offers me will be too much to resist.",Positive
AMD,The thing is that it will get ported to RDNA 3 eventually in some form. But nope. They won’t care. It’ll be all “how could they!!”,Negative
AMD,They are going to release a version for RDNA3.,Neutral
AMD,"""Hope is the last one to die""",Neutral
AMD,"overhead is so much higher though that its barely worth doing. You're basically picking between FSR3 quality, or FSR4 balanced to achieve the same frame rate and the image quality is only slightly better on FSR4 balanced IMO.",Negative
AMD,Mine had horrible crashes for the first year of ownership. I dont think I have had a single crash (that I couldn't explain as me messing with OC) in around 18 months now.   Sucks its still happening to some.,Negative
AMD,"Well yes, but umm akshually no.  You can run ray reconstruction and DLSS 4 on even an RTX 20.  What you cannot run, is [frame generation ](https://youtu.be/1z7aco-y4RE), which fortunately fucking sucks, so yeah, nothing of value was lost lmao",Negative
AMD,You can run DLSS upscaling on any RTX gpu that got released EVER. Nothing being gatekept. Framegen simply isn’t feasible on anything below the 4000 series. Fsr 4 is POSSIBLE on all gpus and we know that due to optiscaler and yet amd hardcore gatekeeps it 🤣,Negative
AMD,"I’ve got access to DLSS4 on my 3070 Ti, and so does the previous generation RTX 2000 series. True, we’re missing out on MFG, but at least we have access to the rest of the feature set.",Positive
AMD,"I keep seeing this argument and its so stupid, gtx was locked out when dlss and rtx didnt matter at all, only became relevant years later. Rdna 3 gets locked out when upscaling is crucial for every game.  Sure 30 series doesnt get frame gen but they can still use fsr frame gen, no big loss there, and 40 series still has regular frame gen, with MFG not being that usefull",Negative
AMD,"You realize Turing cards from 2018 are enjoying DLSS4 right now in hundreds of games, right? It's the best upscaler in the business. Oh and it can support ray reconstruction as well.   Meanwhile in 2019 AMD released the 5700XT with no DX12 ultimate support.",Positive
AMD,"**Or, to put it another way, AMD is now as bad as NVIDIA. It’s been a total shit show since Jack Hyoun took leadership.**",Negative
AMD,I'm out of the loop for team green. What happenned?,Neutral
AMD,"I've been happy with my 6700XT but imo, AMD has accumulated too much lag over the last few years, even if they somehow catch up to nvidia next round, the problem now is adoption. DLSS is mostly retrocompatible to the first RTX gen, and has a 5+ years backlog of DLSS compatible games, while Redstone is practically starting from scratch, and will have a hard time to gain traction when it's exclusive to 9000 series which is a very small number of gamers.",Negative
AMD,"[You can run FSR4 Int8 on RDNA3 right now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB0qmTCzrmI) AMD leaked it out months ago. It's slightly less quality than the normal FP8 version used in RDNA4 but it's still miles ahead of FSR 3.1. Now do you understand why people are upset? AMD 100% marketed RDNA3 as being an ""AI card"" and now they are dead silent on bringing competent upscaling to those cards.",Neutral
AMD,"Absolutely, I didn't buy a 7900XTX to use it with FSR, I got it for the raw performance. If a game runs shit natively on such hardware, then certainly the hardware isn't the issue.",Negative
AMD,"NVIDIA released DLSS4 on the 20 series, they are currently at 50",Neutral
AMD,"Released all versions of upscaling, up to and including DLSS 4, as well as DLSS RR, RTX HDR and few other features for all RTX cards, including those released 7 years ago?",Neutral
AMD,FSR4 upscaling is not fake frames. Thats frame gen. I try to pretty much never use frame gen with the exception of games that pretty much require it (looking at MH:Wilds). Upscaling is fine IMO.,Negative
AMD,"Despite what Userbenchmark thinks, AMD is often awful at marketing.   That new Gabencube being stuck on FSR3 would be a shame.",Negative
AMD,"Fingers crossed. Im upgrading next gen, probably to Nvidia.",Neutral
AMD,FSR4? Has this been officially confirmed? I just keep seeing people parrot this without anything to back it up,Neutral
AMD,"No, it's always worthy to pick even fsr4 perf over fsr 3 quality. And framerate is better.",Positive
AMD,"Uhhh have you even looked at both?  From 4k, even fsr4 performance looks better (to me...) than fsr3 quality in everything I tried, the temporal stability is worth sacrificing babes on a bloody altar.",Positive
AMD,So there’s an improvement? We should get it.,Neutral
AMD,This isn't true...many tech reviewers have it a couple notches above  performance/lookwise..I watched a quick review but it was essentially worth it  The 7900 cards having the best gains...the 6xxx series wasn't worth it though,Neutral
AMD,Only when it was first released  Overhead after the improvements was basically equivalent to XeSS,Neutral
AMD,"FSR3 is unusable at any quality setting because it looks horrendous in motion. FSR4 mostly addresses that, so I'd gladly take a step down in internal resolution for the better temporal stability.",Negative
AMD,Even with an underclock and multiple driver updates and reinstalls it still freaks out and crashes especially in games like CS2.   I’m absolutely befuddled :( idk what it could be besides my motherboard maybe?   nice PFP btw,Negative
AMD,"You can because it possesses the required hardware. That's pretty much the issue with RDNA3, it doesn't have the  hardware to run this feature at a good framerate.",Negative
AMD,"You can do the same on 7000- AMD cards too, problem is the performance.  Granted, AMD does marketing for their new cards, thus the focus on them. But I find it hilarious that people don't understand that.",Negative
AMD,You're not really missing out on anything. Framegen has the paradoxical characteristic of being best where it is least needed and worst where it is most needed.,Negative
AMD,"Gtx was locked out because of the change of the upscaling algorithm, just like the change in algorithm for rdna4. However, AMD is still trying to port a FSR 4 version to rdna3 ect, but it will take time as rdna 4 is the priority. Previous gen users just have to wait unfortunately just like other older gpu from other brands are waiting for certain features.   >Sure 30 series doesnt get frame gen but they can still use fsr frame gen, no big loss there  FSR 4 int8 version can be modded if you really want to use a better upscaler compared to fsr3 and xess. Sure it may work a little worse than the FP8 version but so does dlss 4 transformer older Nvidia cards.   Also I don't see any point in redstone being on older AMD gpus, for what?.. same way Ray reconstruction is useless on older Nvidia cards. People just want them for bragging rights, but never enable it.",Neutral
AMD,"So long as good upscaling is available I'm good.   Don't really care about any kind of frame gen. Like HUB says it's just smoothing and not at all equivalent to real frames. Out of everything I play Microsoft Flight Simulator is the only game I liked frame gen on, and I still enjoy the game even without it.",Positive
AMD,And everybody turned a blindeye and or praised them for it. Hardware unboxed praised the 5700XT as the VALUE CHAMPION.,Neutral
AMD,"Pascal had FSR for years now when they wouldn’t have had any upscaler at all without AMD early on, stop putting one of them in better light here both are not your friend they wanna sell you GPU‘s.",Negative
AMD,I didn't say AMD was better. I'm just saying it's a dumb reason to switch when both do the same thing.,Neutral
AMD,The PCIe 5.0 12vhpwr connectors were prone to not fully connecting and melting.,Neutral
AMD,"the performance is much worse though. you're skipping over that to push your narrative. clearly AMD has toyed with releasing an INT8 version hence why they created it.  The performance cost means you have to drop internal render resolution even lower to achieve the same performance as FSR3 so the benefit becomes minimalized.  Sure INT8 FSR4 is better than FSR3, but maybe they don't want users complaining how little the FPS gain is using FSR4 on RDNA3.",Negative
AMD,"Yup, people only praise companies they have an emotional connection to. Pretty sure nvidia is bad but not everything they do is bad...",Negative
AMD,multi frame gen?,Neutral
AMD,You picked the wrong GPU to not play at your native resolution.,Negative
AMD,No. But they will. Probably in February/march.,Neutral
AMD,That's one way of looking at it. The other way is that people will still complain that the improvement they get isn't the same as the 9000 series GPUs. People are just never happy.,Negative
AMD,"Unstable RAM (not VRAM) overclock can also cause GPU crash. So maybe troubleshoot that, too?",Negative
AMD,Hard to have retrocompatibility when everything you make is a kneejerk reaction to whatever nvidia is doing. AMD has only played catch up ever since the first RTX generation.,Negative
AMD,I played around 60 hours of CP2077 with FSR4 on my XTX. Never had a single performance issue. It runs completely fine on it.,Positive
AMD,"I don't use it either. So far there has never been any situation where I'd take a little boost in smoothness over a drop in true frame rate and increase in latency. I will fully concede that the drop in frame rate and increase in latency is often not noticeable, but the increase in smoothness is often not noticeable either and it bothers me on a psychological level to know the true frame rate is lower and the latency is higher.",Neutral
AMD,The 5700XT was great value when it released... because you could trade it for a way better LHR Nvidia card during the Ethereum days since it was so good at mining.,Positive
AMD,"Back in 2019, I had a choice between the 5700 xt and 2060 super with reviewers recommending 5700 xt lmao. I went with nvidia.",Neutral
AMD,"Because Pascal didn't have Tensor cores for DLSS, does this really need to be said? Pascal cards got NIS at the driver level 4 months after FSR1 was released and would provide similar results to FSR except for the GUI artifacts if used at the driver level. Some games offer it as an option (CoD games still default to NIS in 2025) but it's rare.",Neutral
AMD,"But they don't. Do you need more examples of stuff that NVIDIA has backported to older cards?   RTX Voice brought to GTX cards. Ray tracing unlocked on GTX cards just to demonstrate how slow it would be and so people could stop complaining about how evil NVIDIA is for not letting them try it.  RTX cards have gotten ray reconstruction, DLSS transformer model, RTX HDR and probably some other stuff I'm not remembering.  NVIDIA Reflex goes all the way back to Maxwell (2014) vs AMD locking out Anti Lag 2 at RDNA1 (2019) and that was after people complained because Anti Lag+ was only supported on RDNA3 and got people banned for being a dll injection on the client side.  For anyone paying attention NVIDIA is always years ahead and does a better job of supporting their cards. Yes, they locked out frame generation from Ampere and then multi frame generation from Ada. Not that big of a deal when you consider how many other features they have brought to their older cards.   Also when they introduced Frame Gen for Ada it used Optical Flow Accelerators and they claimed Ampere wouldn't be fast enough for it to be a good experience. Now it uses Tensor cores but already Ampere and Turing are being overwhelmed from the heavier upscaling cost of Transformer model. They could probably backport it but it's not that big of a deal, the good upscaling is way more valuable.",Negative
AMD,"Yes, the performance is worse compared to fsr3 but still better than running at native and MUCH BETTER image quality compared to fsr3. Most of the time fsr4 performance mode looks better than fsr3 quality mode.",Positive
AMD,It's 1 tier difference and that's perfectly fine. FSR4 on RNDA3 in balanced mode will be the same speed as FSR3.1 quality while looking significantly better.,Positive
AMD,"They didn't do it, but tbf it fucking sucks so...",Negative
AMD,"And to those people, I say cry me a river.",Negative
AMD,"Yes, and? AMD had to do that at some point, better earlier than later.",Positive
AMD,"the FSR4 you used is not Redstone. I'm specifically talking about how this new feature could be missing on older hardware, just like frame gen is not available on Ampere.",Negative
AMD,"It is not the same Version of FSR4 that they run on RDNA4 tho, maybe they are testing INT8 FSR4 internally to release it at some point, they have to do all the QC again for INT8.  That is why it takes so long or might not come at all.   Maybe they should just release it as a beta feature or something let the community do the testing, but they are probably a bit more cautious after the Anti Lag debacle.",Neutral
AMD,"The much better image quality *is the whole point to upscaling*.  The artifacts of FSR3 makes it pointless - who cares that you get 90fps on wukong when you all see is motion blur.    It verifiably looks worse than FSR4 using the leaked method at a lower resolution.  It is the same thing as when people talk about the PS5 Pro and they are like ""OH BUT ITS RENDERING AT 864P, WHICH IS WORSE THAN THE PS5"".   Yeah.  Because it fucking looks as good as the PS5 while running better due to that lower resolution.   That is why they did that.    That is the point of upscaling altogether.",Negative
AMD,"Perhaps, but I still think people are just better off turning down settings, especially Ray tracing and just running closer to native resolution anyway.",Neutral
AMD,"Apologies, thought you were talking about FSR4, not Redstone. Yeah...I would understand that probably staying RDNA4 considering my XTX died whenever RT is turned on.",Neutral
AMD,I haven't used FSR4 but I know on my 4090 I use DLSS4 all day long over native resolution. 4K DLSS balanced or performance mode both look incredible now and I find native rendering to be an absolute waste.,Positive

In canada, soon as they were available, i was getting the Sapphire Pure 9070xt for $830 CAD... Considering the typical taxation and everything, that's actually pretty solid for that card, which is more than what major retailers were paying in canada for the cards, but hey were listing them for far more, often into the $1000 range.      My only point of contention is that so many people seem to think, even insist, that retailers weren't gouging them out, that amd somehow was responsible for the ""above MSRP"" listings at these retailers, which is entirely bunk, consumers were buying anyways, sold out, typical supply and demand and boy did people make the retailers richer.",Neutral

Also, when your MSRP was already a lie, raising a price is a good way to ensure nobody buys your GPUs when your whole gig is ""Nvidia -50 dollars"", except now it will be GPU that's objectively worse for the same money.  And believe it or not, best way to build marketshare is to eat the loss now for long term gain.

AMD,"Their numbers are somewhat off tho due to VRAM-limited games wreching proportions for small sample size. By their data 9060 nonXT beats 5060, while without VRAM limits it is a notch slower.",Neutral
AMD,"I don't entirely think so. This GPU is clocked 4.5% lower with 87.5% of the shaders.  That's 83.5% of the CU-mhz, or about 16-17% lower theoretical performance. The TDP is also almost exactly this much lower. If you power limit a 9060XT, it should still be a bit faster thanks to being a wider GPU.",Negative
AMD,"No, Steam machine GPU is more like a cut-down RX 7600.",Neutral
AMD,"Not quite. The Steam Machine has a 7600M, which is basically the RDNA3 version of this RDNA4 card.  However, there is a possibility that OEMs will make their own Steam Machines like how we now have the Legion Go S. The 9060 is an OEM-only card (for now at least) so it's entirely possible somebody will offer a Steam Machine-like-thing with this GPU.",Neutral
AMD,Why would a VRAM limit invalidate a small sample size?,Negative
AMD,That is part of HUB's argument though. In situations where you're vram limited the RX card performs better due to the fact that it has a lot more PCIe bandwidth.,Positive
AMD,Oh so steam gpu is even worse.,Negative
AMD,"The gap is more than it might initially seem, because the card in the Steam Machine is also clocking up to 2.45 GHz where the 7600 and 9060 are more like 3 GHz.  And the 7600 vs 9060 XT is like a 50% performance gap all on its own.",Neutral

AMD,"There will already be branching inside the code of the driver. This has been the case already, to various degrees, for years. It's not new.  It's just whether AMD wants to formally spread those branches out on a file / compilation level and distribute different packages. And then publicly whether they commit to updating all branches of code or only some.  For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch. Of course, we have very little outside insight into the exact spread of these cases that AMD wants to pay their engineers to work on.",Neutral

I'd give this a quick read: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-update-and-see-what-graphics-driver-you-have-on-linux-and-steamos/  Pretty much the default is that you will be using the Mesa driver collection and they were last updated yesterday.  The fixes there do not correlate with the ones in this thread (I think).  As long as you are on a ""cutting edge"" type distro then you can expect that update in the next few days/weeks.

AMD,What are you seeing? I played last night on latest driver and everything seemed fine to me. Playing Ultra RT with Auto on FSR4.,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, modern AMD cards use various telemetrics to push past the rated max boost frequency when headroom is available. Even on default. Problem is, not every board runs stable under these circumstances...  This issue is known to AMD but they don't seem to care.",Negative
AMD,"Have you tried undervolting your GPU?   I've played BF6 since launch with AMD drivers before the game ready one and currently still on 25.10.2 and I've had 0 crashes while playing the game.

AMD,ahh i'm on Win 10 so probably why I didn't see it.,Neutral
AMD,Weird. Why is it a Windows fix?   I also got vsync bug in specific games and the weird thing is that I needed to turn on the and perf overlay in order to work,Negative

AMD,Either launch with curseforge or rollback,Neutral
AMD,"Damn, didn’t work for me last driver either. I can get FSR4 to work in other games just not BF6",Negative
AMD,"Even the rollback doesn't fix it for me now. It being related to the combination of iGPU and GPU makes sense though. Sadly I actively use the iGPU, so thats not an option for me.",Negative
AMD,"Possible I had not any freezing till 9.1 and rollng back to 8.1 solved the problem.  Yet, I don't use any rare hardware. The rig is formed of most common brands and models. So there is something wrong with the driver.",Negative

AMD,I went back to 25.3 official gigabyte latest driver for 9070XT OC gaming and 2 days no crashes for now. Also changed HDMI for DP cable  I will also change in BIOS and completely disable integrated GPU in BIOS,Positive
AMD,"I had auto update on (my mistake), so it did install over the previous driver. I've downgraded for now and it seems to be working just fine.  But no, after uninstalling from control panel I booted into safe mod and used DDU.   Then I downloaded the newest installer from the website. Restarting where needed during this process.

Right click on desktop and open from there, click the exe, or go into a game and try Alt R. Didn't open with any of these methods.",Neutral
AMD,Driver with -s letter after black screen and reboot PC tells me that this driver isn't for my graphic card🤡,Negative
AMD,Does fsr 4 work on 25.9.1? I thought the only driver that works without having to change any files and risk a ban online is 23. 9.1?,Neutral
AMD,"I had to rollback to driver 25.9.1, start up Star Citizen, switch the renderer to Vulkan, exit game, start SC again to verify it's working with Vulkan, then reinstall the latest driver again. Now it works, just don't switch it back to DirectX. No idea who dropped the ball on this one but Easy-Anticheat sure doesn't like the atidxx64.dll.",Neutral
AMD,I'm not sure. However when I install the driver it states that I cannot use adrenaline and gives me a link to the newest driver. Wondering if there is an earlier version of adrenaline I need to install.,Neutral
AMD,They do not.,Neutral
AMD,"Well, I used the system before the latest updates normally, for maybe half a year. Installed every update without DDU. I wanted to triple boot, formated the drive, left windows to install stock updates and drivers, went to install chipset and GPU driver and voila, every wakeup, just before I could type the pin, kernel panic and shutdown. DDU, just the driver, installed again, black screen. Went into DDU again, wanted to see if I missed anything and without reading, uninstalled everything AMD related, went into windows, installed chipset drivers from vendors site (ASUS) and then the latest GPU drivers, and havent had issues. I have a monitor connected via DP and a TV via HDMI.",Neutral
AMD,Dont buy an adapter. Most of them are trash and dont put out the advertised resolution and refresh rate. Not to mention most of them dont support vrr or HDR.,Negative

AMD,"Yes, I’m talking about 25.10.2 (posted the other day here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/s/nNunS1QlFX ). If you go to AMD download page and select “GPU” you get a file that has a different dimension from the one you download if you choose “CPU”. If you do the following steps 1) DDU (or AMD CleanUp Utility), 2) install CPU drivers => GPU not recognized or with a generic driver. If the you install the GPU driver you get the GPU correctly recognized and a yellow esclamation mark on the integrated. To have both VGAs working at the same time I have to download the AMD Auto Detect package (the file name ends with “minimal_install), but Adrenalin App does not open.",Neutral

AMD,"I totally understand. if you're running with an affected display config, you should be fine on 25.9.1 or the 25.10.1 preview driver for BF6. We'll get this out as soon as we can.",Neutral
AMD,"Appreciate you reaching out with this - that's an interesting data point to consider.  In this case, the quirky behaviour with HDMI 2.1 + FRL was attributed to a change made in the display stack, I don't think it explicitly involves display stream compression to repro, just high enough display bandwidth (though I could be mistaken)",Positive
AMD,"Interesting. I've been experiencing random BSODs on my PC too on a fresh Win11 install too, I was also suspecting it was something to do with auto HDR toggle but I didn't know for sure.  I'm running 180hz 1440 LG panel but I don't recall if it's using hdmi or DP. I've also never experienced BSODs until the last week or two, since i did a fresh install and I've had the same monitors/PCs for a long time.",Neutral

AMD,Are you sure? The steam machine has HDMI 2.0 and DP 1.4 listed in the specifications,Neutral
AMD,"Ah ok, that definitely makes sense if you're using a TV. Hope they straighten it out for you soon.",Neutral
AMD,What I did is get the 25.8.1 drivers shut off the fluid motion frames and in Windows set bf6 to run full power on your graphics card. Try some of those things and see if that helps you.,Neutral
AMD,"I tried to reinstall the chipset drivers, the same error, tried to install the drivers from gigabyte site the second screen worked but uninstalled adrenaline and it ran the auto update that disabled the secondary screen and the issue of no adrenaline opening came back, going back to older version, thanks AMD",Neutral

AMD,Thank you! Exciting keen to see what it’s like,Positive
AMD,"It has nothing to do with the lack of vulkan support, even when fsr4 comes to vulkan, the game still needs ray regeneration implementation from the devs, you cant use optiscaler through dlss inputs, like you probably will be able to in fx alan wake 2",Negative
AMD,I suppose is going to be fixed as soon as Amd Redstone go out. Basically is going to add every tecnology that Path tracing needs to work. Off course the devs would have to implement them in the game too,Neutral
AMD,"The issue is if you try to use path tracing. Which to be fair, you probably shouldn't unless the miracle of them getting Virtuous to implement Ray Regeneration in Cyberpunk happens.",Negative
AMD,yes i tried it ... maybe it is because of the 7800X3D ... i really dont know... i will wait for the next patch ... should come tomorrow 18.11. ... but i have read so many threads and i am not the only one...,Neutral
AMD,Hmm fair. For me on 9070XT if I had raytracing enabled it would crash most regularly on loading back to the menu after extraction which was annoying but at least not game destroying lol. But yeah annoying enough that I turned RT off entirely.   I hope this means I can turn it back on because the game runs well enough for it.,Negative
AMD,"My last two processors are ryzen amd, my last three video cards are amd radeon and next one will be amd also, nvidia has driver issues as well, to be honest.  But yes, some issues are too annoying and updating drivers is lottery at this point. I would advice against updating drivers unless you need it for specific new game or have the latest video cards - rx 9070 \[xt\]  or 9060 xt .  I should have sold the 7700 xt and bought 9060 xt 16gb instead but too late for that now and it has problems as well, so lottery as i said, its a risk.",Negative

AMD,OK I will install it now and test it and get back to you. Give me 10 mins.,Neutral
AMD,Yuppp. It does not work on bf6 but it works on ark survival ascended for me. Seems it might be a bf issue. I saw ppl saying they were getting more fps with this driver in BF6 but I think they didn't realize it's using FSR 3.1 and not 4.,Negative
AMD,Try using DDU to uninstall your current drivers and do a clean install of the 25.10.2 combined drivers if you havent already (you can find it here):  https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-25-10-2.html,Neutral
AMD,"Yup just need to say ""No""",Neutral
AMD,"whew thanks, good think i noticed it first before updating. i have 25.10.2 and 25.9.2 here and they both have windows 10 along their filename so i might as well asked.",Positive
AMD,I don't see how it would work on 23.9.1 lol,Negative
AMD,"Did you use DDU to uninstall the drivers and then reinstall using a driver installer from the AMD website?

AMD,I did it this morning before the new driver and confirm chipset drivers were untouched,Neutral
AMD,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.  More people use HDMI than what people think and those TVs don’t always have a DP connector at all.,Negative
AMD,"ah, that explains it. Thanks. :)",Positive
AMD,"What if one does not check release notes? V25.10.2 point to different packages, for installing both CPU and GPU you had to download the AutoDetect package (named “minimal install”). Obviously I’m referring to AMD driver download page.",Neutral
AMD,"Okay, as long as they have a workaround for that... I was planning to get a 9060XT, but also keep my 6700XT for lossless scaling frame gen, was worried the branching would affect that..",Neutral
AMD,"What a mess. I have rdna2 and 3 on the same PC, so combined driver is the solution for this? Or auto detect is the only way?",Negative
AMD,"Damn, that's a huge relief to hear. Most of the frustration came from not knowing whether the issue was even acknowledged.   Thanks a lot for the update.",Positive
AMD,What about Noise Suppression not working since 25.9.2?,Negative
AMD,Finally. The last driver without pink artifacting was 25.4.1  It has been 7 months. AMD Matt acknowledged the bug on [the amd forums](https://pcforum.amd.com/s/question/0D5KZ000011WpJJ0A0/pink-square-artifacting-chrome-discord-and-steam) 5 months ago.  Please let it be fixed with the next driver update. So many 7000series users are on the verge of swapping to Nvidia.  https://i.redd.it/ywrg9at3lp1g1.gif,Neutral
AMD,"what about whatever changed post 25.3.1 for multi monitors? Any driver 25.3.1 and older i can run my main at 200hz, my side at 165, and my third at 60 without issue. Any driver newer than 25.3.1 and running my main at 200hz then playing a game will cause the second monitor (165hz) to flicker, glitch, and freak out the entire time, until the game on the main monitor is closed. Dropping to 165 on the main monitor down from 200hz \*fixes\* the issue but, i paid for 200hz and would like to be able to actually use it again.  (7700xt system)",Neutral

AMD,"Hi. Sorry, I thought this was pretty common as I've had this issue with two different systems and 3 AMD GPUs across 2 generations. [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1jayump/chrome_full_screen_freezes_after_switching_to_amd/) [Or here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/3890720/parts-of-screen-freezes-when-using-chrome) Chrome (or other Chromium browsers, I've had this happen with Edge too) in fullscreen, with graphics acceleration enabled.   Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",Neutral
AMD,"Keep in mind this only actually matters if one protocol or the other is **actually** limiting bandwidth for the [resolution * FPS] you want to display on your monitor  For instance, DP 1.4 can do ~25Gbits/s, which translates to roughly 1440p @ 240fps, or 4k @ 120fps  If you have proper cable into HDMI 2.1, it should be able to do ~42Gbits/s, which would instead be 4k @ 190fps  Read up the wikipedia tables for bandwidth specs and resolution / fps / bit depth rates for more",Neutral

AMD,"Could be it, nothing hardware wise at all and just software too.     Yeah, you're not the 1st I've read that says they have issues on the game.     If you're crashing and the system reboots it does make me think of some stability issues and not really just GPU, but I'm guessing you've already tried stability tests and using the system without OC+A-XMP/EXPO disabled.     Once upon a time I remember reading some people, on other instances and other games, having crashes like that (complete reboot) due to PSU instability as well.     Good luck!",Neutral
AMD,That's strange. My game defaulted to everything maxed out including running ray tracing and I haven't noticed any issues. The game runs incredibly well.  I've got a 5800X3D & 9070XT as well.,Positive
AMD,"Fair enough, and yeah sooner the better for all of us",Positive
AMD,It absolutely could be.  Europe has some pretty good consumer law and promising features that could impact your purchase decision are part of this law.  It can fall under misleading advertisement,Neutral
AMD,"It's not freezing, it's just that the GPU usage is practically at 100% all the time, even with V-Sync enabled. With the 25.9 drivers, this doesn't happen, and the clock speed varies normally, increasing and decreasing as needed when V-Sync is enabled. These 25.10 drivers are causing the GPU to consume more energy unnecessarily.",Neutral

AMD,"Yeah, I'm facing the same issue on RX 9060 XT   Is it a GPU driver issue, or a Windows issue that Microsoft needs to fix?",Negative
AMD,"That's not how it works. Small print won't save you from stuff like this, you think that they can stop releasing this software for 2-3 years because some small print said 'Subject to change'?

AMD,"Praise the lord. I've been hoping they would drop one of these for some time. Getting one with an X3D CCD would be insane, but likely not possible with the current Strix Halo packaging design.",Positive
AMD,Honestly would be pretty neat. I’ve seen the full strip halo and it looks nice but for a gaming APU a bit overpowered(?),Positive
AMD,Took so long to see strix halo come out...  Hopefully this variant is quicker.,Negative
AMD,It will take half a year until you see them in actual products. Enjoy your Framework Desktop.,Positive
AMD,The performance is good enough for light AI work in a laptop.  This especially with max RAM.,Positive
AMD,Best they can do is sell to mini PC manufacturers the 99% of strix halo supply,Neutral
AMD,Honestly this. It’s not like for the purpose of gaming there’s anything that will run well on the 8060S but be bottlenecked by 5060’s 8GB vram after DLSS.,Negative
AMD,"Well, I guess there is one use, if you're into Linux mobile gaming it is pretty much your only reasonable option. NVIDIA drivers are kind of shitty on Linux. That's why I would consider this option in a mobile platform. It's got a very mature driver stack and AMD is generally plug and play on Linux.   You're usually talking about a single digit performance gap between Windows and Linux on a mature AMD GPU versus solid double digit gap on NVIDIA hardware.",Neutral
AMD,"Not really, optiscaler is REALLY good imho. It's definitely breathing new life into RDNA2 and RDNA3",Positive
AMD,Why would anyone pair a 9950X3D or 9800X3D with a a 4060?!  V-cache makes zero sense for an APU.,Neutral
AMD,"It's strix halo, the plus seems to mean it has the full 8060s iGPU.",Neutral
AMD,Huh?  The use of AI  hardware will transform gaming!,Neutral
AMD,"If you take out 8060S it would just become an I/O die without which the CCDs won't be able to function. So it's indeed an iGPU. Besides, aren't pretty much all 'CPUs' and 'APUs' are SoCs anyway these days. The difference lies in how they are being marketed towards potential buyers.",Negative
AMD,X3D cpu is an overkill anyways with what’s effectively a 5060 mobile in gaming.,Neutral
AMD,I wish they'd go further and make a 6/40 SKU. Strix halo does better when CPU's aren't eating the TPD.,Neutral
AMD,"this will cost like 90% of the full one while being purely a gaming chip, I don't see much point there",Negative
AMD,"Definitely has too many CPU cores, unless you’re buying it to play Factorio or Cities Skylines lol",Neutral
AMD,It should as the 388 is literally just a 395 with one 8 core chiplet instead of two but it will depend on when OEMs want to release laptops with them ultimately.,Neutral
AMD,…if ever. It will only have uptick if it’s meaningfully more economical for oems to adopt because 16 cores is a good marketing point for the high end config.,Positive
AMD,Niche* mini pc manufacturers to be specific with the sole exception of one HP model. Nothing from dell or the main Lenovo brand.,Neutral
AMD,"This, some people don't seem to realize even the 9070 XT has literally zero difference between a 9700X and a 9800X3D based on HUB's benchmarks.  Tragic note, I have a 9070 XT and a 9800X3D. Had I known I would've just gotten a 5800X3D instead and stayed on AM4.  People base 9800X3D performance based on non-GPU bottlenecked benchmarks like those HUB and Nexus were putting out on launch, which means with a 4090/5090. Incidentally, anything short of a 5080 desktop does not see any discernible benefit on most titles, and even that is miniscule. Less so at 1080p.",Negative
AMD,"I second this, I love the 8060s but it’s not super beefy and the resolutions that it will dominate at still wouldn’t need x3d,",Positive
AMD,"An x3d has better ipc so it would allow for lower cpu clocks, lower voltage (hence lower power), allowing the gpu to draw more power, and get more performance.",Positive
AMD,Nuh uh it ain't. Don't dissuade them!,Negative
AMD,"It wouldn't be worth it to put a fully unlocked large chiplet with a cut down much smaller chiplet though, it wouldn't make sense as the cost to produce 6 core + 8060s would be almost the same as 8 core + 8060s.",Negative
AMD,"I thought all Paradox games are still mega single-core quatters, no?",Neutral
AMD,"If it comes out in a laptop for about $1000 it wouldn’t matter, would be massive especially if it can come with 64gb of ram",Positive
AMD,"Yeah.  395 devices are so damn expensive, most of what we've seen outside of 2 handhelds are mini-pcs and that ASUS tablet.",Negative
AMD,No amount of power in the world would make 8060S faster than a 5060. It’s been tested to death even pushed to 140w in the few strix halo desktops.,Negative
AMD,Real life buyers would prefer their money to go to meaningful upgrade. And in a laptop it means always prioritising the gpu for the common 2560x1600 resolution.,Neutral
AMD,It would be a purely gaming focused product. 6c vs 8c is no difference especially at the GPU level of 40CU. Would be good sense to use bin-failed cpu dies to reach price points the market will actually pay.,Neutral
AMD,"IDK. If it's better for gaming like he says, they could literally sell it at the same price.",Neutral
AMD,"Cities Skylines 1, yes. Cities Skylines 2 can use at least 16 CPU cores though (I believe you do get bottlenecked by single core at some point).",Neutral
AMD,"Sure, but that doesnt mean people wouldnt be interested in a part that is more performant and power efficient.",Neutral
AMD,"X3D CPU means that more bandwidth can be reserved to the GPU whithout using any MALL cache, not to mention that the saved power can be allocated to the GPU it would improve the graphics situation as well.  What I'm not sure about is if it's possible on the custom chiplets AMD uses on Strix Halo.",Positive
AMD,TIL I'm fake.,Negative
AMD,"I get that but I think it's far more likely we would see a 6c + 8050s as it just makes no sense for them to make a 6c + 8060s as their 8060s yeilds would be better off going to a Ryzen AI 392 12c + 8060s or 395 16c + 8060s as the CPU yeilds aren't the problem, the iGPU yeilds are.",Negative
AMD,I think it scales up to 64 or 128,Neutral
AMD,"agree, they share ram, so x3d would help more than on desktop in bandwidth saturated scenarios i think.",Neutral
AMD,The MALL on strix halo is already off die on another chiplet. The cpu accessing it for the cpu would airway incur an extreme latency penalty. All ryzen L3 cache is on the same CCD as the cpu die. Why do you think MALL was remotely relevant to the cpu?,Neutral
AMD,I’m sure you can find at least one user in the whole world that wants a 9955HX3D paired with a 5050.   That doesn’t mean it’s not an extremely unbalanced combo for gaming and the lack of such real world product proves it.,Negative
AMD,"Strix Halo doesn't use the standard Zen 5 chiplets, it uses a custom version with a better interconnett, that's why the CCDs are right to the side of the IOD instead of far away like on desktop part, so no, there wouldn't be the usual latency penalty if AMD were to set MALL cache as usable by the CPU.",Neutral
AMD,"Most eSports and MMO games would run just fine on such a GPU while benefiting massively from the extra CPU horsepower. It doesn't exist because the product doesn't exist. Strix Halo as it is, is a niche product and a novelty. If strix halo can exist at all, I wouldn't rule out a future iteration with support for x3d.",Neutral
AMD,Yeah Wow and FFXIV players seek configs like these. Though a 9800X3D is enough.,Positive
AMD,"The CCDs themselves are architecturally the same and only the interconnects are different. And not being as bad as on desktop Ryzen doesn’t mean it’s usable, cross CCX latency is bad enough even on the same die (Zen 2 CCD’s divided L3 cache and literally all of their monolithic APUs come to mind, all have horrid latency across CCX).",Negative
AMD,>It doesn't exist because the product doesn't exist.  It doesn't exist because there is no demand. There is absolutely nothing technically infeasible to pair 9955HX3D with 5050.,Negative
AMD,"Well, that's a 16 core CPU though. AFAICT, there's no 8-core x3d SKU for laptops. We're discussing an 8 core strix halo CPU aren't we?",Neutral
AMD,"You heard of motherboard, now get ready for mommyboard",Neutral
AMD,And for some reason has fewer USB-C ports than my current gen motherboard,Neutral

AMD,At $269.  Better off with 7600x3d or 7800x3d,Neutral
AMD,"This is great, more choices, and more stuff to go on sale cheap when it doesn't sell because upgrading is a better choice!",Positive
AMD,Same Price as 7800x3d here in scandinavia. No point in doing it. Got a 14600k for 120 dollar with bf6 included for my girlfriends pc. Once amd throws out proper budget cpus her pc will be an intel,Negative
AMD,At what point does it make sense to move on from a 5800x3d? Ram prices are so astronomical I feel like I will be chilling here forever. Still doesn’t bottleneck my GPU…,Negative

AMD,Got a 7800x3d for less 2 years back lmao.,Neutral
AMD,The 5 people who want this must be so happy.,Positive
AMD,Will still never beat a 110$ 7800x3d lol.,Neutral
AMD,Yeah only $30 cheaper then a 7600X3D seems really weird. Feel like it needed to be around $229 to make sense.,Negative
AMD,i just bought on amazon entirely new Boxed ( not tray ) versions of a 7800X3D for 273€ each make it kinda pointless honestly.  saw the 7800X3D also for 303€ recently.,Negative
AMD,I just bought a 7800x3d price matched at Best Buy for $279,Neutral
AMD,It’s gonna be used to keep 7800x3d prices high.,Neutral
AMD,"The prices are a bit different in the UK, 7600X3D is £280 (only one reseller as far as I could see), and the 7500X3d is £240, it is a meaningful change.  Though that said I did pick up a 7800X3D for £177 on Tuesday from a UK warehoused Aliexpress seller. Somaybe right now due to Black Friday deals, this doesn't look like the best priced CPU.",Neutral
AMD,"Certainly not right now with these prices.  Wait 6 months to a year and then ask the same question again.  Right now, the AI bubble is screwing everything up, just like crypto did.",Negative
AMD,£120 5700X3D was my killer deal. Gonna ride that till AM6 hopefully.,Positive
AMD,Gonna ride this thing until it dies. At this point the 5800X3D is gonna be the 1080TI of CPUs.,Negative
AMD,I also have this CPU and I don't see any reason to upgrade in forseeable future.,Negative
AMD,Yes it does.  You're snoozing.,Neutral
AMD,7500X3D is not US exclusive. I can buy it right now in Poland from local shops.,Neutral
AMD,Read that as “buy an American friend”,Neutral
AMD,"Usually these last second old gen x3d chips are targeted for other countries with poor pc component prices (5500x3d for example, the targeted consumer base was central-south america)",Neutral

AMD,When was that and which retailer?,Neutral
AMD,It's ~$375.,Neutral
AMD,If it’s available in places other than just Microcenter then it makes sense imo,Neutral
AMD,It's more than 10% cheaper for a less than 10% drop in performance. Seems very fair?,Neutral
AMD,"I mean, it’s better price to performance than a 7600X3D.   I don’t understand this weird bias people have when analyzing low end parts. The best price to performance is usually near the bottom, “stretching” to get the slightly better component (say, the 9070 vs the 9060XT) makes your PC. **worse** value. You’d do better off upgrading more frequently and getting these low end value options, heck, you’ll often have better performance.",Negative
AMD,£177 for a 7800X3D is a bangin price.  Are there any left?,Neutral
AMD,Share it!,Neutral
AMD,"I mean it does make sense when you think about it.  At some point I had a US friend who, for a year, travelled to Europe and back like 3 times a month for work. I can't for the life of me remember which state he lives in, but he's got super low sales tax, and his work would always get him either an eco+ seat or business class, so he had AMPLE amounts of luggage to bring tons of shit with him.  I basically used the guy as a mule (I wasn't the only one and he was fully willing lol) except instead of drugs it was clothing, food and drinks, and PC hardware. That year I saved thousands of euros because I could get cheap shit with little to no tax, no import fee and no VAT.  Oh and also those AMAZING Microcenter deals. When you combine those package deals with very low sales tax, no VAT, no nothing, I got extremely cheap hardware, prices yet unseen on the European continent.",Neutral
AMD,"Check their post history, they got lucky with a weird deal on a 7800x3D a year ago, and they've been riding that high ever since lol.  I still don't get how them getting a good deal though means this is a normal thing for kther people to expect",Negative
AMD,never,Neutral
AMD,Might be an OEM seller,Neutral
AMD,"makes you wonder why it even exists. one of them. that's not meaningful performance difference  also 7500f/7600/7600x/9500f  it's like same thing. any 'real' performance gain is only between 7400f and 9600x, and it's not even that big of a difference.  [https://www.techspot.com/articles-info/3051/bench/Average-p.webp](https://www.techspot.com/articles-info/3051/bench/Average-p.webp) just.. why  i find 9070/9070xt and 5070ti / 5080 also kinda confusing. they're so close in performance, even same memory. why not make meaningfully faster product instead?  5080 is most infuriating here, price difference is ridiculous for card that's essentially 5070TI super. and gap's huge between it and 5090, both performance and price. if you cant afford 5090 and want something better than 5070ti for 4k, you're shit out of luck",Negative
AMD,"Not necessarily the case. In Australia there always seems to be amazing deals for the 9070/9070xt vs the 9060xt which makes it more price to performance (799 for 9070 rn vs 569 for 9060xt 16gb). Besides, with you already paying a fixed cost with some components like the case and ram, losing a bit of value on price to performance doesn't necessarily translate to the total system being less value. Also in the US, the 9060xt 16gb price to performance is pretty much proportional to the 9070xt rn. I find the sweetspot for gpus has usually been in the ""70 tier"".  This is more true for CPUs tbh where increasing price doesn't add much unless you need to push very high frame rates in competitive games. This means people can often get a ""budget option"" like a 7500f and pair it with a midrange gpu like a 5070/5070ti and be fine at 1440p which is the intended resolution for these cards.",Positive
AMD,"Not at £177, but currently gone down to £195, if you pay via paypal and use code GB2294, not sure how long that will last though.",Neutral

AMD,Wow  That is awesome value,Positive
AMD,"9070 and 9070XT has the extremely simple explanation that it's binning, XTs that aren't quite up to par to be confidently sold as XTs just get the undervolt/underclock treatment and get to be base 9070s. Which tbh the base 9070 is high key really good on temps and power consumption while also just outright beating the 5070, just a shame the on paper and in practice price jump to the XT makes it a hard sell.",Neutral
AMD,"5080 is a joke, imo. NV more or less did an arch tweak and a power increase on the 4080 and called it a day. Die is literally the same size. It's a perfectly reasonable graphics card but I can't be impressed by a refresh for a grand that is slower than the XTX tune I've been running for over two years. 16GB has been midrange since Vega Frontier in 2017 if we want to be honest.",Negative
AMD,I’m pretty sure it’s part binning. Some chips just come out that don’t reach the required clock speeds so they tune them down and sell them cheaper  Sometimes there aren’t many of these chips so they restrict supply to certain regions  At least this is what I understand,Neutral

AMD,Valve will port FSR 4 to RDNA 3 and 2 (Deck and Machine) before AMD does.,Neutral
AMD,Shows that AMD are a bit naff in their driver support. If they did better they'd get more sales revenue in their GFX department. Makes one wonder what they are doing with all the profits.,Negative
AMD,Fuck yes!,Negative
AMD,"Well this will likely use the INT8 version of FSR4 on older RDNA GPUs. The only reason AMD is not bringing FSR 4 to older rdna GPUs is because they lack FP8 suppprt that RDNA 4 has. The FP8 units are very important for ML based upscalars that DLSS and now FSR 4 use.   Thats the reason older FSR versions which used INT8 worked on a lot of older GPUs as they all already had INT8.  The INT8 Version of FSR 4 is better than the FSR 3.1 but not as good as the FP8 version.   I am guessing AMD is afraid that if they launched a INT8 Version of FSR4 even though it would be better than FSR 3.1, it would bring the overall perceived quality upgrade of FSR 4 below what the original FP8 version can do.  This is still not a good reason to keep it from older cards and I am in no way defending them, just trying to put my perspective of why they might be doing this other than $$",Neutral
AMD,Yes! How does this work? Proton will now automatically translate FSR 3.1 calls to FSR 4?    Next can we please get Radeon Image Sharpening 2 on Linux??,Positive
AMD,Is this available now?,Neutral

AMD,Need more companies in the circlejerk it's not big enough.,Neutral
AMD,"True, but having it as a launch command supported by proton, without needing optiscaler, would be great.",Positive
AMD,"No, other way around. It used to work, now after intervention by someone higher up (likely AMD) it doesnt.  Somewhat complicated due to the structure of Proton and the way FSR4 had to be reverse engineered to work on Linux at all, meaning that AMD were not involved (their own fault entirely I might add) but fundamentally a maintainer of a sub-tool within Proton has disabled the FP8 emulation pathways of their codebase at the request of someone ""above my pay grade"".",Negative

Most of the reason a laptop is “slow” is bloatware and has nothing to do with the cpu choice anyway.  And Intel is already “beating” AMD in laptop cpu sales, by a substantial margin. People incorrectly assume AMD has most of the market share in all segments because of the very noisy and super-biased gaming reviewers, who mostly focus on $3000+ gaming desktop builds. Yes AMD is handily winning there.",Neutral
AMD,"I have a T14s Gen 5 Core Ultra 5 135U and recently I saw \~9h of battery life, browsing websites. It's quite nice piece of hardware so with Lunar Lake it would be just perfect.

AMD,"AMD is held back in laptops by some shady deals of laptop manufacturers with Intel. It's impossible to get a 4k AMD laptop with 5090 for example, all of those are Intel (I found literally one AMD laptop like that compared to 25 from Intel). That's utterly ridiculous.",Negative
AMD,">The most important characteristics of a laptop are battery life ( power efficiency) and screen quality. That is what sells ( non apple ) clamshells.  I fully agree with what you said and this makes me wonder what in the genuine fuck was going through Lenovo's head when pricing their Thinkpad line of laptops. They're all wildly, and I mean WILDLY overpriced for what they offer, speaking as objectively as possible.  For the average Joe there's still no beating getting a refurbished Snapdragon X Elite laptop with 16 or 32GB or RAM at a €800 pricepoint. Nothing comes close in battery life, and these laptops come with decent OLED.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, so much of laptop performance is dictated by things other than the cpu. Its kinda wild.   Intel does a way better job getting good laptop designs. Amd historically has just been a cpu seller, telling oems to go wild and do whatever . . . And it always ends very badly.   The biggest sign amd is taking share is not cpu benchmarks, but will be things like having premium screens, good thermals, lack of bloatware, dual channel memory, good SSDs, good colors, etc etc. and . . . ACTUAL AVAILABILITY. I dunno how many reviews i see where they review and intel and amd parts. Usually there is some way intel has a better premium finish.

AMD,"But haven't you heard, AMD beats Nvidia slightly at linux gaming benchmarks.  That means AMD has the best software support.",Positive
AMD,"I miss the times when laptops were far more upgradeable. I got a budget laptop for college with a low-end dual core, a spinning HDD, and 1 stick of 2GB RAM.

AMD,All the more reason to make it upgradable,Neutral
AMD,Lunar Lake isn’t how Intel beats Amd lol. Panther lake will stop a lot of the bleeding for sure. AMD is so far making mostly good moves and Intel is as well with LBT. The goal for Intel over the next 3 years is stop losing customers base. I will point out Intel still has about 75% of all x86 customers.,Neutral

AMD,I guess the point Intel is trying to make is that it's great for gaming and much better for content creation (aka work). It's also cheaper.  X3d CPU's are only better for gaming (and not in all games). Doesn't mean they are crap but you pay a premium for x3d.,Positive
AMD,"if you think you're 100% correct - go out and buy an x3d and run the tests, post a video with the results, and put an amazon affiliate link in the comments for a 14700k build that overall is better than an x3d.  there's nothing wrong with the 14700k, it's a beast. i think there's a few select games where it even beats the 7800x3d. but there's a reason that you can find hundreds of youtube channels with sub counts up and down the spectrum from 0 subs to 10M subs showing hardware side by sides with the x3d's beating the 14700k - and most of them don't have advertisers to please.  in my opinion, you're getting downvoted because you don't want to provide proof, you're out here saying it's tech tubers fault that you have no proof. you can also find a good amount of open source benchmark data at openbenchmarking.org, it's not pretty - but there's useful data there as well.  but hey - you're only hurting yourself by not breaking open the youtube techfluencer conspiracy around AMD processors. go buy an x3d, do all the testing, and use it as a springboard to free us from the lies of big tech. i'd love for you to be correct, but until you can provide proof, it honestly just looks like you have buyers remorse with your 14700k.",Neutral

Plus, 14900K is not a CPU for gaming, it's a CPU for production workloads plus gaming, which makes it noticeably more expensive than 9700X, so realistically we should compare 9700X to 14600K/14700K.",Neutral

AMD,"I sell PC hardware and get to test a wide range of components. I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance. I’ve shown full system specs and game settings every time, and provided more evidence than any tech site or tech YouTuber ever has, yet some people are still in denial. I want just one tech site or YouTuber to show benchmark screenshots or disclose full system specs before testing. None of them do, and people keep trusting charts with zero evidence.",Positive

AMD,"Intel still trying to sell their already abandoned platform, they should learn something good from AMD and provide support for three generations per socket (and yes, Zen 6 will use AM5, already confirmed by AMD).",Neutral
AMD,"Two things can be true at the same time. Arrow lake has legitimately improved since it launched last year, and Intel is portraying it in the best, most optimal light they can that is probably not representative of a broad spectrum of games reviewed by a third party.   It would be interesting to get a retest of arrow lake now, but I dunno if it is worth the time investment for some reviewer like TPU or HWUB to re-review a relatively poor platform that’s already halfway out the door.",Positive
AMD,"Arrow Lake performs quite well at general compute and power efficiency compared to prior generatons ans even against AMD.  Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU. Ironically the 9070 performance was identical with a 9700X and a 9800X3D.  So it's actually kind of the reverse, gaming reviewers painted Arrow Lake in the worst possible light.",Neutral
AMD,What do you mean by gaslighting in this case?,Neutral
AMD,"The answer depends on whether or not you're a ""next-gen AI gamer"" (apparently that means 1080p avg fps with a RTX 5090).",Neutral
AMD,I doubt they would give false numbers. Those are probably what you get with the setup they list in fine print. Also they pretty clearly show the 3dx parts are faster in gaming. But they have probably picked examples that show them in a good light.   There is nothing wrong per se in the arrow lake lineup. In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all. The issue that destroyed the image of arrow lake is that the previous generation was often faster in gaming. That made every reviewer give it bad overall reviews.,Neutral
AMD,Wait till refresh comes out in December... Memory latency lower and performance boosted. Price also lower... Wish it could come to the old chips but it architecturally cant. :(,Negative
AMD,"generally they cherry pick, so maybe the demo they use is process heavy with minimal I/O (arrow's biggest performance hit is memory movement). if you manage to keep memory movement low core performance is actually really good on arrow lake. it just gets massacred by d2d and NGU latency, which they don't get a pass for but its unfortunate that decent core designs are held back severely by packaging.",Negative
AMD,"there is just no way dude lol  even their comparisons make no sense, 265K = 9800X3D / 265KF = 9700X? lol? how would that even be possible",Negative

AMD,"As a real world example, I upgraded my primary system from a 14700k to a 265k recently. My other desktop is a ryzen 7900 (non x, 65 watt tdp)  Compiling my os takes 6 minutes on the 7900, 10 minutes on the 265k, 10 minutes on a 3950x, and 16 minutes on the 14700k.   That is not in windows, but my os which does not have thread director or custom scheduling for e cores. (So going to be worse than windows or Linux)   All the numbers except the 7900 are with the same ssd, psu, custom water loop.  The motherboard and cpu changed between Intel builds and the 3950x was the previous build before the 14700k.   The e core performance significantly improved in arrow lake.  It’s now keeping up with 16 core am4 parts in the worst possible scenario for it.  If the scheduler was smarter, I think it would be very close to the 7900.   In windows, it’s pretty close in games I play on frame rate to the old chip. A few are actually faster.",Neutral
AMD,"> And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  Yeah, 10% less performance when frequency matched is quite a lot.",Neutral
AMD,Telling people that its performance is better than it actually is?,Positive
AMD,The ones with similar pricing not performance,Negative
AMD,"True, except AM5 supported all cpus 7000, 9000 and will support the newest one. So not exactly true per se, because you need a new motherboard every time and those on AM5 can upgrade cpu without buying a board. Imagine if someone was on 13400F and wanted to buy lets say 285K? Well, you need a new board. So it depends what “cheaper” is seen as.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep. We all see the patterns here. Gamers nexus, HUB, LTT and most big name they all keep mocking Intel, even when Intel did good job to bring improvements to their products like fixing Arrow Lake gaming performance but those ""tech reviewer"" decided to be blind, they don't even want to revisit Intel chip and benchmark it, they don't even want to educate their viewers.    At the same time they keep overhyping Amd products to the moon like they own the stock, it's obvious now who is the real reviewer and who is fraud reviewer using their own popularity and big headline to spread their propaganda for their own benefits. They are just as worse as shady company!",Negative
AMD,"Platform longevity isn't stupid lol. There's a reason why am4 is one of the best selling and one of the best platforms of all time. The fact that you can go from a 1700x to a 5800x3d on the same mobo for 85% more performance is crazy good value. You can say that all you want but there's a reason why in the diy market everyone is buying amd over intel. People know arrow lake is doa where as am5 actually has a future, which is why everyone is flocking to the 9800x3d in droves.  Zen 7 is rumored to be on am5 as well. Meaning that am6 would come out in 2030/2031. If that's true am5 lived for around 8/9 years.  That's insane value to get out of one socket.",Positive
AMD,Quite common for AM4 in my experience.,Neutral
AMD,"My brother went from 1700X to 3700X to 5800X3D on AM4, so 10 years next year?

Kinda want better 1% lows tbh, but maybe I’ll just wait for next ones unsure.",Neutral
AMD,"How is it stupid? On one hand, intel sockets used only 3 gens from 12th-14th while on the other hand amd has not only used 7000-9000 but will also be using zen 6. I don't think you realize just how big of a hassle changing motherboards are",Negative

AMD,I originally had a Ryzen 5 3600 and am now on a 5700x3d so it’s pretty relevant I’d say. Of course it’s anecdotal but I don’t think it’s too uncommon,Neutral
AMD,"I agree with you, it’s daft, no doubt about it. But you’ve got to factor in that people can be daft too. Most tend to skimp, only to end up buying another middling CPU the following year, and then again after that. And so the cycle trundles on.  When I buy PC parts, I usually go for the best available. Provided the price is reasonably sane. I picked up a 9900K seven years ago and it’s still holding its own. Is it on par with the 9800X3D? Of course not. But it’s still a very capable bit of kit. Next time I upgrade, I’ll go top shelf again.",Neutral
AMD,"They frequently revisit products and test old hardware, but naturally that's not going to be their focus. Channels with that focus like RandomGaminginHD fill that niche.",Neutral
AMD,Sooo they are in the YouTube space for the money not for the love of tech,Positive
AMD,"So true. After all they are reviewer, it's their job to revisit something if it's worth to benchmark due to improvements.   Didn't they said they want to educate their viewers? If so then why being lazy? This is obvious they just care about making big headline which makes more money for them. It's BS!",Negative
AMD,"If only the Arc B770 can beat the RX 9070XT with performance and features, then I definitely stay on Intel's side, but RN I doubt it",Neutral
AMD,"Even accepting that as true, I don’t think it changes the main point I was making. Arrow Lake has probably improved versus a year ago. It’s probably not as good as intel is making out. A good third party reviewer would be needed to determine by how much, yet it’s probably not worth their money and time to test it.   So the truth is probably in between what Intel is saying here and what the state of things was 6 months ago.",Negative

AMD,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Neutral

AMD,"u/triptoasturias Your concern is related to **port and bandwidth limitations**. Most Inspiron models only support **HDMI 1.4**, which is limited to 4K at 30Hz or 2560×1440 at 60Hz. Ultra-wide resolutions like 3440×1440 often aren’t exposed because they’re outside the standard HDMI 1.4 spec. **USB-C to DisplayPort**: This works because DisplayPort has much higher bandwidth and supports ultra-wide resolutions natively. HDMI-to-DisplayPort Adapter, Unfortunately, **passive adapters won’t work** because HDMI and DisplayPort use different signaling. You’d need an **active HDMI-to-DisplayPort converter**, but even then It will still be limited by the HDMI 1.4 bandwidth from your laptop.

Nvidia wants some custom SKUs of server chips to pair with its data center GPUs, and Intel wanted a better solution for pc parts for the GPU tiles.   NVIDIA is NOT getting an x86 license, nor do they want one. In case you haven’t noticed, Nvidia is a $4T company largely on sales of data center GPUs, sales of which were 10x the gaming segment. Profit/earnings ratio of data center is even higher than the 10x.   In my opinion, the only reason for Intel to use RTX chiplets on pc parts is so they can have a few skus for mobile gaming. Lower end laptop chips would still use Xe cores.  This solves NONE of intel’s structural issues - they need, in this order  1. Major foundry customers  2. Regain server market share 3.

AMD,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive. I know they have a lot of tricks up their sleeves still, like designing HBM memory onto the die (how Vega was supposed to be originally) and unified memory (soldered down, see the new AI branded chips).",Negative
AMD,Ohh noooerrrrrrrrr,Neutral
AMD,"Actually this may be good for AMD and I will tell you why: Open source drivers. Nvidia if they had a say in intels graphics division would make the intel GPU stuff proprietary and locked down and when support ends its gonna hurt. Meanwhile AMD has open source drivers and in the age that linux is gaining popularity will make it the preferred platform for anyone interested in the growing linux ecosystem. Nvidia will NEED to change how they handle things or intel may not be as attractive as they once were, intel has already suffered a massive knock on thier reputation and this may be the mortal wound that can work in AMD's favor.",Neutral
AMD,"I don't see how this means anything at all for AMD in desktop. This is borderline irrelevant for desktop gaming. Most users pick up an Intel or AMD CPU and an NVIDIA dGPU.  APUs don't really exist in desktop gaming.  In mobile? I think most people won't care much. Intel and AMD APUs both offer compelling and reasonable alternatives for everyday usage. Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.

AMD,Theres no way that nvidia is gonna let intel keep producing entry level gpus that directly compete with their own. I know their deals are in regards to apus and to compete with strix halo but nvidia is not gonna invest into a company with a competitor to their gpus.

AMD,"3D cache will eventually become full of assets and dip, if and onlyif IMC is bottlenecked by random memory access.  - the ability for cache to transfer data from memory, to IMC, to cache has a FPS hit (cache hit-rate). This is due to the bottleneck of a chiplet-based IOD: compromising memory latency with cache hit-rate. Eventually the cache fills and relying on IMC to feed the cores anyway.  You can easily test this by monitoring 1% lows and increasing memory latency (lowering DDR4 B-die clocks/DDR5 hynix and increasing timings) to see how Cache holds up when full of assets while memory is being bottlenecked-   What games need is 10-12 P-Cores and an IMC capable of high speeds.

Its a give to compare you will need to match the clocks.  Funny you you should mention latencies, considering that core to core (even accross clusters), latencies of Skymont are better than Lion Cove? So if latency is the issue, it has nothing to do with Skymont and everything to do with the trash uncore they have based on the Meteorlake SOC. Even workstation Crestmont on a different package performs better. Furthermore skymont IPC is measured based on Arrowlake. Arrowlake is worse latency than Raptorlake and Zen already.

For the i9 they can have 4 such solitary E-cores that have their own cache and hence do not touch the L3 cache.

AMD,"It's capable of a few things, but the main mechanism from what I've seen is that it temporarily disables three out of four cores in each E-core cluster by forcing them into the lowest power state. The result is that the remaining active core has access to each cluster's full L2 cache (2MB on 12th-gen, 4MB on 13th/14th-gen). L2 cache isn't shared with P-cores (L3 is global), so this can really minimize E-core cache evictions before they're forced into slower memory, and games do love themselves some cache.  It's a genuinely clever way of maximizing available resources and I really wish they'd allow user control over its features, but it seems to be pretty tightly leashed to/by the team that developed it. It obviously wouldn't benefit every situation, such as particularly low/high thread occupancy situations, but it's pretty rough to have the option tied to quarterly updates for one or two specific games.",Neutral

Intel was doing way more precession without having to round so earlier on a consumer FPU while the Alpha CPU was a Mainframe one.

They just had the hardware for it from the get go so they could implement it quicker.  They did make Xess though which is miles ahead of FSR 3 even on AMD systems (on average.

When I was testing some stuff out (trying to see how close I could get my Deck to the Switch 2 build) I found Xess to be a unsuitable. Even on the lightest Xess mode, the performance hit was a bit too noticeable. FSR doesn't look as good as Xess but it runs better and you can get away with a bit more upscaling artifacting on the Decks relatively small screen. Just rendering at a lower res and letting the screen upscale was also a solid option in that scenario.  As I say though, that's an edge case where you really just need outright speed. If your GPU doesn't support DLSS or FSR4 then using Xess makes sense in the vast majority of cases.",Neutral

AMD,"Videocardz is wrong      This chip will likely be called ""Core Ultra 5 445k"" it's an 8+16 die with bLLC + 4LPe   (Not sure what suffix Intel will use to denote bLLC SKU maybe ""L"")    Ultra 3 has 4P + 4E + 4LPe  Ultra 5 has the 1x 8+16 tile + 4LPE   Ultra 7 has 8+6 P-Cores and 16+8 E-Cores +4LPe   Ultra 9 had 2x 8+16 tiles + 4LPe tile   Ultra 300 series will be reserved for mobile only Panther Lake and/or Arrow Lake Refresh   Ultra 400 will almost certainly be Nova Lake.",Neutral
AMD,I think this competition will tight up alot in the next gen for both intel and AMD.  Intel has had a superior memory controller for awhile now and AMD will finally address this in Zen 6.  AMD has better cache setup with VCache which Intel will finally address in NL.  May the superior arch win!,Positive
AMD,This is pat's work,Neutral
AMD,This is normal Nova Lake or the bLLC version? I heard the bLLC version has separate SKUs.,Neutral
AMD,8 Big cores with loads of cache and then a couple of E cores with their own cache for background tasks would be great.,Positive

AMD,"Like I commented before, hope (but really don't believe) this is NOT the product that is only 10% faster than arrowlake because liquidation awaits them otherwise",Negative
AMD,Will it be available in fall of this year or 26Q1?,Neutral
AMD,So it only took them like 5 years to come up with a luke-warm response. cool cool. It's especially bad as Intel actually introduced something similar (eDRAM LLC) into the x86 space many years ago.,Negative

AMD,Only Core i3 can have 65watt ? no more i5 at 65Watt ?,Neutral
AMD,"For some reason it seems to me that all these new different micro cores are cores from ten years ago at the level of Broadwell or Lynnfield, but made on thin nm to fit everything under one lid lmao",Neutral
AMD,Cool.  I have said for a while now that is want both the extra cache AND a few lesser cores to offload stuff to.  The only alternative that has this atm is the 9900x3d and the 9950x3d.  Next gen when im buying new stuff then perhaps intel will have an alternative to those then.,Positive
AMD,"The 52 cores is exciting, but I would probably use Linux as my main OS and run Windows in a VM. Plenty of cores and plenty of RAM and it would be a great machine.  A 52 core desktop beast with an Intel graphics card with 128 GB VRAM would be a killer machine. LLMs would run like lightening.",Positive
AMD,"Intel mocking the chiplet design, describing it as gluing processors together and then doing it themselves - this screams that energy once again.",Negative
AMD,So Nova Lake IS happening? This talk about skipping to next node had me anxious..,Negative
AMD,"So alder lake on cache steroids ?  If the heavier core count chips don’t have the LLc cache, and if this chip is faster at gaming than the heavier core count chips, how will Intel market it?   If they call it a core ultra 5 or 7, then that will make the core ultra 9 seem less of a halo product.  Will be interesting to see how they market it.",Neutral

The CPU’s clearly starting to bottleneck a bit, but it’s not super noticeable yet.  Is it worth waiting for Nova Lake, or better to just go with Arrow Lake Refresh when it drops?",Neutral
AMD,NVL will definitely be the 400 series. PTL is 300.,Neutral
AMD,"Naming can be changed, but the most important thing is, this isn't the upcoming arrow lake refresh  I hope arrow lake refresh fix the memory controller latency tho",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, I expect the 300 series to be Arrow Lake refresh and Panther Lake.",Neutral

AMD,Why not 8 P cores with HT + even more cache and no e cores at all,Neutral
AMD,"A large L3 will help a ton with latency. It's why AMD has so much success with it using chiplets which have a ton of extra latency. Reduces all those higher latency trips out to RAM. Intel's Nova Lake processors are expected to feature the memory controller integrated back into the CPU tile and if that's the case this L3 might be a really big hit for gaming, etc.",Positive
AMD,If latency slightly increases or stays the same due to adopting Pantherlake optimizations and the newer Foveros then that might be enough to narrow the gap,Neutral
AMD,I assume the cache is based on Lunar Lake's memory side cache which doesn't bring much if any noticeable latency over Arrowlake H,Neutral
AMD,"Also done with them. Changing socket every \~3 years was also bad, but this is disgusting.",Negative
AMD,"Not sure how it could be, given all the extra cores.  That said, for lower core count workloads, like gaming, I doubt gains of more than 10% are achievable by anyone, at this point.  I expect NVL to be a big power/thermals/multithreading win, than anything else.",Neutral
AMD,Nova lake? More like 26Q4.,Neutral
AMD,Only Pantherlake for mobile,Neutral
AMD,"It doesn’t matter so long as all major vendors will automatically ship with whatever Intel puts out.

AMD,"Since when they are ""mocking chiplet design""? Have you forgot Intel is the first when it comes to gluing chip together? Intel did this with Core 2 Quad. Meanwhile Amd copying that with ryzen but sadly people don't want to admit it.",Neutral
AMD,It is really happening. The only question is when? Or can they release it on the next year without delay?,Neutral
AMD,"Core Ultra 9 has 48 cores (and 4 LPE cores). It slaps you in the face as halo SKU (unless it becomes entry level threadripper target?).  Currently rumored:  (8+16E+BLLC, 8+16E)  8+16E+BLLC  8+12E+BLLC",Neutral
AMD,The i9 sku is rumored to be two 8+16 tiles. So slotting in an extra bLLC 8+16 tile instead of a normal 8+16 one for the top sku doesn't sound impossible.,Neutral
AMD,Probably same way AMD did the 5800X3D 8 core which was slower than the 5800X at productivity and had less cores than the 12 core 5900X and 16 core 5950X.,Neutral
AMD,"E cores are the future, P cores days are numbered.",Neutral
AMD,ARL refresh is not worth it. Go AMD or wait for NVL if you want.,Neutral

AMD,"You just missed some pretty killer deals around Prime Day; that would have been the ideal time to go with Arrow Lake.  The 'refresh' will offer better performance, but I highly doubt the value difference will be significant.     You can definitely wait a bit.",Neutral
AMD,"I would like the naming with suffix ""C"" for cache at the end or maybe ""G"" for gaming.",Neutral
AMD,"W11 has (mostly) fixed the scheduling issues, in fact the scheduler was already pretty good by the time Raptor Lake launched. Sometimes it can mess things up but it's quite rare nowadays. The only time I have seen some small issues is with legacy single threaded software.",Neutral
AMD,"Why would it be butchered? the issues with big/little are long gone now - but I guess to your type none of that matters - getting upvotes for blind anti-MS zealotry is all that matters.  but given that this is an intel sub, i am surprised its not merely blind anti intel zealotry instead.",Negative

AMD,"Raichu has repeatedly talked about BLLC ""variants"", so I wouldn't assume that all skus have the large L3.   Plus, it seems extremely wasteful to have all the skus have BLLC.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, Skymont are more like space efficient P cores that are down clocked and don't have all of the features. IPC is really good.",Positive
AMD,This is wrong. Arrow Lake already uses E cores for gaming to no performance hit.   12-14th Gen sure. But not with the new E cores and no HT. You’re using dated info.,Negative
AMD,"A number of public tests have shown that, even with all the P-cores disabled, ARL is still pretty good in gaming.  It's not the E-cores.",Positive
AMD,No different to 12-14th gen then.,Neutral
AMD,"windows pretty much gave up on this and just allows you to set to performance mode, which always tries to grab a P core first.",Neutral
AMD,"Or that I forgot they don't have HT on the newer chips.   To be honest I was meaning 14th gen P and E cores with more cache not the new gen stuff. We know the IPC, memory controller and core speed is enough it's just the cache that makes it fall behind AMD in gaming.",Neutral
AMD,E core is 30% faster than hyper threading,Neutral
AMD,HT is worse than E cores,Negative
AMD,>Intel's Nova Lake processors are expected to feature the memory controller integrated back into the CPU tile  They aren't,Neutral
AMD,It will enlarge the ontile L3 cache most likely with a cache only tile with high performance die to die connect. No 3d stacking until 18A-PT is available for production which will likely be well after Nova Lake tapeout which should be done now or with in the next few months in order to ramp up production in early 2026 and be on the market by late 2026.,Neutral
AMD,">That said, for lower core count workloads, like gaming, I doubt gains of more than 10% are achievable by anyone, at this point.  If you are in the lead, maybe this argument is valid. However Intel is behind Apple in ST and behind AMD in gaming. They have plenty of room to improve.",Neutral

AMD,ARM chips regularly do this sometimes on a yearly basis.,Neutral
AMD,A lot of gamers have no clue that Intel is actually doing well with ARL for OEM laptops/dekstops as ARL is basically a laptop design warmed over for desktop chip usage.,Neutral
AMD,Core 2 quads and Ryzen chiplets are totally different ways of doing MCMs  C2Q didnt have an IO die and it pretty much worked like having a 2 socket motherboard      IO die is what enabled much lower latency and the ability to connect much more CPU dies together (EPYC 9005 got 16 CCDs),Neutral

AMD,"> They stopped trying to sell capacity to external customers and they will try again with 14a. It's not like they had a lot of capacity to spare. It's not even enough for themselves  Intel claims they can double to 1.5x their EUV capacity in arizona and ireland, if customers asked for it, in 1-2 years.   They built out all they needed for their own internal 18A demand too.",Neutral
AMD,"It shouldn't become an entry level workstation part since the Ryzen 9 will have 24c/48t to go against it.   48 cores (plus the 4 LPe, but those shouldn't factor in too much) should handily beat 48 threads, but not by enough to reach Threadripper territory.",Neutral
AMD,Most likely the bLLC variant wil be single compute tile and single cache tile as this would be cheaper for now than putting bLLC cache in base tile like Amd did. They can do that when 18A-PT is avaliable which will probably be after Nova Lake goes into production with 18A or maybe 18A-P,Neutral
AMD,"Lmao, some of my games still runs on e cores",Neutral
AMD,People are still disabling e cores for more performance.,Neutral
AMD,"Varients because there are two tiles. One with BLLV, one without. Full chip had 1 BLLC chip and 1 without. No actual SKU (not tile) without BLLC in some way so far",Neutral
AMD,"They are nothing like P-core as designed with no hyperthreading, area/space efficienct and integrated into clusters of 4 e-cores with shared L2 cache",Neutral
AMD,fym no different they're 50% faster,Neutral
AMD,No. ARL architecture is definitely not optimized for latency but hiding memory access which favours multithreading instead of gaming. Hopefully Nova Lake will optimize all the latecy issues with ARL arch and decrease latency to L3 considerably aswell,Negative
AMD,"Yes, but in games, it's the P-cores that are meant to be utilized. Also, more than eight cores or 16 threads aren't really necessary for gaming. The 9950x3d isn't faster, than the 9900x3d.  My point is that the space taken up by the E-cores could instead be used for additional cache, not?",Neutral
AMD,I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it. Anyhow if that's true the large L3 should be even more helpful for things like gaming as it will keep those higher latency hits down. AMD has always had higher latency due to the same kind of design with a separate memory controller so we have pretty good data on how extra cache can help.,Neutral
AMD,"As a advice, Nova Lake will further increase memory latency.",Neutral
AMD,In which gen iteration?,Neutral
AMD,Editorialized. But its funny because said quote is attributed to AMD when Intel made Core2Duo (or Quad?),Neutral
AMD,"If its is with 10% of threadripper 9960x at half the price, it will definitely hurt the low end threadripper cpus a lot for productivity/creator types who would love a more reasonable priced high performance entry level workstaion. Low end workstation is probably bigger market than high end gaming desktops anyways.",Negative
AMD,"Another factor is that Apple has booked out all the N2 capacity for the better part of a year before AMD can touch it.  Nova Lake will have been out for a while, before AMD shows up",Neutral
AMD,Process lasso can let you just designate by task so the E cores can do background and side jobs. People use process lasso on the 7950x3d to make the X3D chiplet run games with those 8 cores and the other 8 core chiplet for everything else.,Neutral
AMD,What issue did you run into with a 9800x3d? It has one CCD and no small cores,Neutral
AMD,"Nowadays there are very few cases where disabling E cores is extremely beneficial, sometimes they are a detriment to performance but more often than not they are useful. Not to mention the E core design team is more competent than the P core team and are quickly catching up in performance.    The E cores in Alder Lake had relatively poor ST performance but in Arrow Lake they are much faster and closer to the P cores in raw performance. Every new generation the gap keeps shrinking and it will make the disabling of E cores less and less relevant.    Sometimes the Windows scheduler will wrongly assign an E core to a ST bound task, even if a P core is available, but it doesn't happen often enough to be a serious issue.",Neutral
AMD,"yes, but not because of windows scheduling - its because you can OC higher with them off - better temps and easier stability - some people disable HT for the same.",Neutral
AMD,They don't pay attention,Negative
AMD,"No. Intel needs to do what Amd did and add seperate bLLC just for gaming. As long as latency is reduced to the L3 cache including bLLC, gaming performance will definitely increase as 285K and 9950x have similar performance in both gaming and productivity with small lead going to Amd. But x3d totally dominates ARL beacsue of the obvious huge cache difference and lower overall latency to their cache implementation.",Neutral
AMD,That is more so bc the 9950x3d isn’t really a 16 core cpu it is two 8 cores,Neutral
AMD,"There was one article a while back that reported something like ""intel goes back to integrated mc"", not understanding that panther lake is a fundamentally different product than the tile based desktop products.",Neutral
AMD,How do you think they're doing 2 compute tiles if the memory controller is on one?,Neutral
AMD,">I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it.  I'm curious, which leakers have said otherwise?   You could still have mem latency improvements without the mem controller being on the compute tile too, so the situation there can improve either way.   >AMD has always had higher latency due to the same kind of design with a separate memory controller so we have pretty good data on how extra cache can help  Yup, and ARL has higher mem latency than AMD even, so obviously there is room to improve even without having to move the mem controller back.",Neutral
AMD,"Intel will definitely decrease latency with Nova lake and as long as they add a bigger L3 cache variant, gaming performance will increase further to challenge AMD",Positive
AMD,"If you go straight to the source, the quote they used is directly on Intel's slides. Intel literally wrote that, regardless of who said it first.   [https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pPtQr2PKSemDqkhahtz8VN.jpg](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pPtQr2PKSemDqkhahtz8VN.jpg)",Neutral

It's very possible Zen 6 DT is out before NVL-S, and it's very likely that NVL-S and Zen 6 launch within a few months of each other, if that even.   Also, if AMD wants to pay for TSMC N2 capacity, TSMC will build it out. Just a couple days ago we had a [report](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250724PD213/tsmc-2nm-capacity-2028-3nm.html) about TSMC being very aggressive with N2 scale out, and the reasoning here is two fold- first of all, 2026 is technically the 2nd year of N2 HVM, and also because a *lot* of major SOCs, other than just Apple and AMD, will be on N2- demand for N2 is high, and build out will be too.",Neutral

AMD stacks the cache directly on top (9000 Series) or under (9000 series) the CPU cores, right?",Neutral
AMD,"Yes but IF Intel decides to do quad channel for AI nonsense at least for flagship model, Amd threadripper will be stomped over as I will definitely buy the Nova Lake part just for the price/performance compared to 9960x threadripper. The motherboard selection alone for Z890 is absolutely amazing and RDIMM prices aretwice as expensive for the same amount of memory. I expect with CAMM2 that max ram capaciity will go for 512GB and maybe 1TB for Nova Lake aswell. Even with 2 channel, cudimm will go above 10,000 MTS and maybe 12000 if we are lucky on CAMM2 modules by 2027 as CAMM2 definitely being used for DDR6   I do feel Intel has I/O advantage beyong gaming and that market is getting bigger than hardcore gamers all the time!! A decked out 256GB Arrow Lake z890 based computer is way cheaper than same memory sized threadripper 9960x.",Positive
AMD,"I don't recall Intel stating that NVL core chips would be at TSMC, only that some of the eventual package would be... which implies iGPU, to me, and that wouldn't be N2 (possibly N4, since Battlemage is N5, and N4 would be open and cheaper than N3 nodes).  Do you have a source, where they directly claim the NVL cores are coming from TSMC?",Neutral
AMD,"The game is a dumpster fire when it comes to CPU utilization, it hammers even top tier gaming chips like the 9800X3D. I'm not surprised if the E cores can bottleneck the performance even further, most likely some of the game's heaviest threads get (wrongly) assigned to the E cores.    The scheduling in W11 has been significantly improved over the last few years but it's not 100% perfect either. Legacy software in particular, which typically utilizes 1 core, often ends up running in an E core and as a result you can't take advantage of the higher ST performance a P core provides. In that case you need stuff like Process Lasso to fix the problem. It doesn't happen very often but when it does it's very annoying.",Negative

AMD,"That seems really strange, since ARL was designed for both 18A and N3, and they just went with N3 at the time.  Now that 18A is ready, and capacity is reserved for Intel themselves, you'd think NVL would just plain be fabbed there.

AMD,Is anyone left?,Neutral
AMD,"Wonder what node such a product, if it does exist, would use for the iGPU tile.   AFAIK, rumor is that the iGPU tile for the standard parts would be on 18A or an 18A variant. However, if this is a flagship part, I would assume they would be willing to pay the extra cost to use N2...   However that would also presumably involve porting the architecture over to another node, which I don't think Intel has the resources, or wants to go through the effort, to do so.   Also wonder if such a product will finally utilize the ADM cache that has been rumored since like, forever.   And this is a bit of a tangent, but I swear at this point in the leak cycle for a new Intel product, there's always usually a ton of different skus that are leaked that may or may not launch - right now we have NVL bLLC, NVL standard, and now this, and a bunch of them end up not launching (whether they were cut internally, or the leaks were just made up). So it would be pretty interesting to see if any of the more specialized rumored NVL skus end up actually launching.",Neutral

AMD,"The low volume part of that quote is important. If you're making heaps of them, each can take up a little bit of the startup costs for that design. If you only make a few, those costs get concentrated on what you do make.  Low volume also means a single defect is promotionally more of your possible units, and hits the margins harder. You do get more total defects in a larger run, but at sufficiently high quantities of those defects, you start making lower bins to recover some of the defects. If you hardly make the volume to cover one widespread SKU, you aren't likely to have enough to make a cheaper one with any degree of availability. At some point you hit a threshold where it's not worth selling what would be a lower bin because there's not enough of them.",Neutral

AMD,"Intel has had plans for big ass L4 cache for almost a decade now, just that it never made it past the design board.  Supposed to be marketed as Adamantium. But it got ZBB’d every time I suppose due to cost.  For Intel to implement Adamantium, regular manufacturing yield has to be good enough I.e cost is low so they can splurge on L4.  Of course now they are forced to go this way irrespective of cost. I’d love 16p + L4 CPU.",Negative

Not to mention they did shady business like keep doing rebranding old chip as the new series to fools people into thinking it was new architecture when it wasn't and sell it with higher price compared to chip on the same architecture in old gen.  Intel surely needed to kick Amd ass because Amd keep milking people with the same 6 and 8 cores CPU over and over with price increases too!

But truth to be told, your downvote won't change anything!!",Negative
AMD,"Even though it's not stacked, I believe it's still going to fix the last level cache latency issue MTL and ARL have.   Ryzen CPUs have lower L3 latency than Intel because each CCX gets their own independent L3, unlike Intel's shared L3. Now in NVL, the BLLC configuration will replace half of the P-core and E-core tiles with L3, so possibly giving the existing cores/tiles their own independent L3, improving latency and bandwidth over shared L3.  But one thing intrigues me. If this cache level has lower latency than shared L3, wouldn't this more properly be called L2.5 or something below L3 rather than last level cache? Will NVL even still have shared L3 like the previous Intel CPUs? I know the rumor that it will have shared L2 per two cores, but we know nothing of the L3 configuration.",Neutral
AMD,"> On one hand, this shouldn't cause any thermal and Fmax implications like 3D stacking has created for AMD's chips, however doing this would prob also make the latency hit of increasing L3 capacity worse too.

AMD,Intel managed to run Sandy Bridge's ring bus clock speeds at core clocks which resulted in 30 cycles of L3 latency.   Haswell disaggreated core and ring clocks allowing for additional power savings.   Arrow Lake's L3 latency is 80 cycles with a ring speed of 3.8ghz,Neutral
AMD,"I'd like to see the HEDT X-series come back too, but Intel would have to come up with something that would be competitive in that area.  It's not hard to see why Intel dropped the series when you take a look at the Sapphire Rapids Xeon-W lineup they would have likely been based off of.  I think AMD would also do well to offer something that's a step above the Ryzen lineup, rather than a leap above it like the current Threadrippers.",Neutral

AMD,Maybe that is your experience.  Neverthelesss if you compare most gamers who switched to 9800x3D they report a significantly noticeable uplift in fps and 0.1 fps. Maybe a negligible few reported a decrease. And this has very likely nothing to do with the x3D CPU but other causes.,Neutral
AMD,"Ah you’re missing the final piece. As far as i’m aware this pretty much requires controlling the OS as well (or at least solid OS support). Consoles get their own custom operating system, Apple built a new version of MacOS for M chips. Intel and AMD though don’t control windows.",Neutral

AMD,"Intel needs something decent because AMD has taken a page out of intel (up to gen7) playbook, same cores no changes. Intel now provides more cores but it's the 100% core increase Vs AMD 50% and bLLC that should shake things up, hopefully they keep the temperature down as I don't want to have to replace case and get a 360mm rad just to not throttle, and not ever again do a 13th and 14th gen degradation show.

Hopefully intel i5 has 12P cores and i7 18-20P cores that would be nice to have",Neutral
AMD,"bLLC is just a big-ass L3$ and since Intel does equal L3 slices per coherent ring stop, it'll be 6\*12 or 12\*12 with each slice doubling or quadrupling. The rumor is 144MB so quadrupled per slice, probably 2x ways and 2x sets to keep L3 latency under control.",Neutral

AMD,It is a massive issue for amd. You're voltage limited like crazy as electron migration kills the 3D cache really fucking fast. 1.3V is already dangerous voltage for the cache.,Negative
AMD,"I still think there's a slight impact (the 9800x3d only boosts up to 5.2GHz vs the 5.5GHz of the 9700x), but compared to Zen 4, the issue does seem to have been lessened, yes.   And even with Zen 4, the Fmax benefit from not using 3D V-cache using comparable skus was also only single digits anyways.",Neutral
AMD,"Adamantium was always rumored to be an additional L4 cache IIRC, and what Intel appears to be doing with NVL is just adding more L3 (even though ig Intel is calling their old L3 the new L4 cache? lol).   I don't think Intel can also build out Foveros-Direct at scale just yet, considering they are having problems launching it for just CLF too.",Neutral
AMD,Zen6 is the last AMD CPU using its socket anyway,Neutral
AMD,"I'm an e-core hater but arrow lake e-cores are really performant and make up for the loss of HT. arl/nvl 4+8 would wildly beat 6c12t adl/rpl.  HT was always a fallacy anyway. If you load up every thread, your best possible performance is ~60% of a core for a games main-thread.  I would much rather pin main-thread to best p-core in a dedicated fashion and let the other cores handle sub threads. Much better 1% lows if we optimize for arrow lake properly (still doesn't hold a candle to 9800X3D with HT disabled though).",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, I somewhat agree with this. I suppose it depends if Intel’s latency problem with their P+E core design is at all a fixable one - 4c/8t is still shockingly serviceable for gaming, but 4c/4t absolutely is not.",Neutral

AMD,"Sooo a few months ago, I helped a buddy of mine troubleshoot a black screen issue on his newly built 9800X3D and RTX 5090 rig, a fairly common issue with Nvidia’s latest GPUs.  While working on his PC, I'd notice a series of odd and random hiccups. For example, double clicking a window to maximize it would cause micro freezes. His monitor runs at 240Hz, and the cursor moves very smoothly, but dragging a window around felt like it was refreshing at 60Hz. Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.  I did my due diligence on his AMD setup: updated the BIOS and chipset drivers, enabled EXPO profile, made sure Game Bar was enabled, set the power mode to Balanced. Basically, all the little things you need to do to get the X3D chip to play nice and left.  But man... I do not want to ever be on an AMD system.",Neutral

AMD,"Now both AMD and Intel chips are “disaggregated “ which means between cpu and other agents like memory controllers, pcie, and storage there is higher latency than the 12/13/14th gen parts. AMD has higher latency due to the larger distances involved on the package.  Also Intel is not really improving the CPU core much. There won’t be a compelling reason to upgrade from a 14700 until DDR6 comes out. At least not in desktop. Nova lake high cache parts will cost $600 or more so value/dollar will be low.",Negative

AMD,"As a long time AMD user I know that Intel needs to be tuned to perform best. So when you tune the 14900K or even 285K you get like 20% performance uplift vs stock. X3D just performs great out of the box because of the huge L3 Cache. At the very least if you do not like microstutters or frame drops and want consistent gaming performance Intel 14th gen is superior vs current AMD's offering. Anyone with a specific board like Apex, Lightning, Tachyon, or even Gigabyte Refresh boards + i7/i9 13-14th gen with decent memory controller can achieve similar gaming experience.

Seems that was sorted on 9000,    Let's wait and see on nova lake and zen6, like I said, brand loyalty is stupid, bought into AM5, so it's cheaper for me to go for zen6 with 244Mb of L3, but no am6-7 that will be intel.",Negative

AMD,"That channel has a lot of videos and even on this specific video it would help if you point the specific time you're referring to.  Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.  So by virtue of their fast memory Macs are easily 3x to 8x faster than PC on LLMs.  The rest is quite different though which is why what benchmark is important.",Neutral

I'm a dev, I want my code to be the fastest on all platforms  I have: - M4 Max so I can optimize on ARM and MacOS - Ryzen 9950X so I can optimize with AVX512 - in the process of buying an Intel 265K so I can tune multithreaded code to heterogeneous architecture.  The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough. So I expect the next-gen CPUs (Zen 6 and Nova Lake) to be quad-channel by default (~200GB/s with DDR5) so they are at least in the same ballpark as M4 chip (but still 2x slower than M4 Pro and Max).  I also expect more soldered LPDDR5 builds in the coming year.",Neutral
