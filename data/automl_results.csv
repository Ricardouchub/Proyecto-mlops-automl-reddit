Intel,"that amt of hair in a clean room, steve should wear a hooded rain coat lol.",Neutral
Intel,I thought that was Denis lol,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah this is a really surprisingly open factory tour, at least compared to when Sapphire took Linus and Alex along. It feels unprecedented to see this much access and insight, but that's the goodwill nurtured by Steve paying off in spades. The lament about AMD and Nvidia ditching the sub-250 side is real, so having Arc actually be a usable option down here is going to be significant later on.",Positive
Intel,"Pretty good video with a lot of detail I haven't seen in previous factory tours. I probably still won't use an Intel GPU for gaming, but for a media server it's probably sufficient.  Side note: It's funny how whenever a GN video gets posted, the same cast of characters comes out and writes essays criticizing the video, apparently without watching it. I guess that's what it means to ""make it"".",Positive

Intel,"Woah, a GN video that is actually interesting and informative for once instead of just ranting about the fact hardware companies exist to make money, not please gamers.",Positive
Intel,That hat is so useful,Positive
Intel,Making them isn't important selling them is.  The reality is that this segment doesn't actually exist it has no buyers in it.  Seems intel is truly doomed trying to win segments that if they even exist aren't big enough to pay back their R&D even if the dominate them.,Negative
Intel,"To be fair this is not a clean room, just SMT assembly. Basically, soldering components. A lose hair might be a bit of a problem (kind of like in any factory), but his hair is tied and doesn't seem to be an issue.  At an actual clean room (where the actual silicon is processed and etched), the standards can become very crazy.

Intel,"It’s crazy. I think Steve and GN are doing the lords work with their nonstop, accurate coverage of the absolute shit state of the computer component markets and the megacorps that perpetuate it.

Probably the same mfs that bought MKBHD’s wallpaper app lmfao",Negative
Intel,"Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket. To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of similar performance or even outperforming the cards in those brackets.

Intel,"They're talking about the A310 and A380, of which Nvidia doesn't have anything made in this decade to compete with and AMD has the 6400 that came out 5 years ago.  The only cards with modern features in that price segment that consumers can directly buy are the A310 and A380.",Neutral
Intel,He(Lucas) stated $100 was the market that was abandoned.  10:37  > Steve: So why still making A310?  > Lucas: Because what's the competitor have? Nvidia? like... GT710? GT1030? (laughs) No way. So literally Nvidia AMD already give up the segment of this like... $100 price card.,Neutral
Intel,This guy was talking about the A310 which is a $100 GPU. Basically said that the only other options at that price bracket are either a GT 710 or a GT 1030. And from AMD you can still get an old RX 550. The A310 may be slow but it beats those two gpu's by a mile.,Neutral

Intel,Now do SR-IOV and 16GB RAM for under $400.,Neutral
Intel,B580 has 12gb of vram though,Neutral
Intel,"Sad that all of those are 8gb cards. Even if comparable or faster than the B580 aside from that, the lack of vram makes them far inferior products imo.",Negative
Intel,I just wish all of those options were more compelling tbh. I think what Steve was trying to say was that AMD and Nvidia have just half assed that market segment at the expense of the consumer. All these being 8gb cards for $250-$300 is kinda ridiculous in 2026. I’ll take a b580 over a 9060xt 8gb or 5060 any day of the week.,Negative
Intel,Go to r/PCMasterrace and they will downvote you into oblivion for even MENTIONING the possibility of gaming on a 5060 let alone 5050 XD,Negative
Intel,The title is just playing the YouTube algorithm game. It's stupid but they have to do it.,Negative
Intel,"> Love how 5050 is actually at msrp now cheapest b580 is $349+  Just an FYI but B&H has the [Acer Nitro B580 for $249.99](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1874395-REG/acer_dp_z4bww_p01_nitro_oc_arc_b580.html) and the [Intel Limited Edition model for $259.99](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1869297-REG/intel_31p06hb0ba_arc_b580_limited_edition.html). So you can get B580 for MSRP, but for how long who knows.",Positive
Intel,"die area is not the only cost indicator. B580 actually uses N5 fab, which is likely cheaper than N4, used by 5050. In reality, B580 only has about ~15% more transistors and if we assume N5 is cheaper per transistor and N5 has higher yields (by being more mature) i'd say their die cost might be very similar.  While yes, it has wider memory, the chips are clocked lower, so they can buy slower bins, reducing per chip cost.   B580 has more power draw, which in turn costs more for power delivery and cooling.  All in all, AIB manufacturer likely has lower margin per card as it stands, so i wouldn't be surprised if intel is taking a lower margin on the gpu/gddr combo to get more market share.  Nvidia on the other hand optimized their cost REALLY well, as they have been doing GPUs for almost 30 years.",Neutral
Intel,"Nvidia is getting such good performance out of such a small die because they're the best. Simple as. They've been doing GPU's for decades. It's not unexpected that at this stage Intel needs to use a larger die to match the performance - it would be incredibly surprising if that wasn't the case.  But a small *part* of that die size advantage comes from that narrow 128bit bus, and *part* of B580's appeal is its wider bus and subsequently more VRAM.",Positive
Intel,"I see b580 for € 260. That's VAT included. rtx5050 is similarly priced.     And i found $300 lot on US amazon.  Considering other post, maybe search better than 1 place or something.",Neutral

Intel,I do not know if the numbering scheme from my workplace is common across the industry but the smt assembly would be in a class 5 or 6 clean room and the fabrication itself would be a 1 or 2 class clean room,Neutral
Intel,"I think it still matters to a certain point, thats why everyone in the factory is wearing a hat. The Factory boss decided to roll RNG dice and say *""Fck it, that small hat is fine, even tho wearing it is pointless now; I'll just pray nothing bad happen*"". lol  What hilarious is when you think about what going through uninformed factory-employee's head, after they saw some guy(Steve) walk-into the factory like that. Definitely a lot of ""WTF"" moment going through their mind lmao.",Neutral

Intel,This sub is genuinely weird. They complain about PCMR when the level of discourse here is much worse and a lot more mean spirited.,Negative
Intel,"They are truly rage baiting drama mongers sadly. The fact that the causes they support happen to be semi legit and consumer friendly in nature does not take away from the fact that they are essentially drama and negativity for profit at this point, and often out of touch with reality. You can be positive, polite, and have reporting standards while still calling out shitty behavior and ripping bad practices to pieces.   Companies are not your friend. That includes GN. They stoke hardware enthusiast anger for their own gain. Personally i think the harm they do to the space/peoples mentality is farm more than the amount of good most (key word most, fire risks and stuff deserve prompt drama) of their coverage does.   Even this title takes a topic and very educational opportunity to provide actual hardware coverage and immediatly try’s to stoke negative furry about some aspect of the hardware industry. Its just non stop with them. I dont think its healthy for anyone to watch then honestly, which is sad as i used to enjoy their review/news. I hope for their sake they are not actually so perpetually angry and they are doing what they do to knowingly manipulate their audience for increased views/engagement. I cant imagine living life so constantly angry at every possible point over computer hardware, as much as i am saddened by the current state hardware and love gaming.   As tough as it is with rising prices and such and sad to think of what we could have instead, modern hardware, gaming, and such is in a nearly historic good state (realistic cost to perf is probably lowest in history other than brief periods such as the 30 series launch), and is a very cost effective hobby compared with other ones for the time you get out of it. Many great games launch all the time (even if big name traditional games have largely went to trash). They are easier to run with hardware (like the ARC gpu) being quite cheap and capable. People, like GN, need to temper their overexagerated frustration with a dose of real world perspective and objectivity.",Negative
Intel,"Might be just the thing for older machines and a GNU Linux (or BSD like) migration. Or as a pass through GPU to Jellyfin, Emby, or Plex for media transcoding. Edit: or Small form computing tied together with a iGPU enhancing game performance...",Neutral
Intel,yeah there is a reason the a310 cards they are making are 4 hdmi out.  Gotta know your market,Neutral
Intel,I assume those are being marketed to OEMs who make digital billboard systems or something. No idea why else you would want 4 HDMI ports on a card.,Neutral
Intel,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310. Almost anything these days is better than an A310.  >  Like the GT710 make no sense nowadays (their last attempt was what, the GeForce GTX 1630?), even though they sold like hotcakes for offices and for people who just wanted HDMI outs.  GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered. GTX 1630 was okay but it was supposed to be $149 USD MSRP and it came out for like $200 USD in most stores due to GPU shortage at the time, not much NVIDIA could really do about that.",Neutral

Intel,"Compared to my 890M based laptop, the 890M numbers here are about 15-20% lower than what I'm seeing at the same settings.  This is likely due to power targets?  Even if the uplift is just 60% instead of 80%, that's still an impressive achievement for the B390M.  It's a shame that AMD appears to have dropped the iGPU ball in 2026.  Relying on the Strix Halo is not an option here.  It's pretty much impossible to find a good laptops that use it.  The upcoming HX470, and still without FSR4, isn't going to close the apparent large gap.  It seems that AMD forgot to stay hungry and they'll end up losing whatever ground that they'd gained in the last few years.  Mind you, Intel is known to play pressure games with laptop makers too in order to limit AMD adoption, which just makes it even crazier that AMD isn't doing what's required to keep the pressure on.",Negative
Intel,"I think the B390 could be faster than even an RTX 5050 35W (As it could beat an RTX 4050 at 60W).       These thin and light laptops that Panther Lake is built for use way underpowered GPUs. Honestly, it makes sense why the Dell XPS 14 only has the B390 graphics. Before it used an RTX 4050, but it ran at just 30W of power.       Now that Integrated Graphics have beat the -50 Tier of GPUs I don't think we'll even see an RTX 6050 or RX 9050",Positive

Compared to AMD, client and DCAI is doing well, for client CPUs and GPUs are doing well, putting no pressure in mobile, in fact their strategy has remained the same in the past couple the years and even if marginally their % share is sufficient for them. Intel pushes a lot of supply for mobile, while AMD is smaller, it is all relative in the necessary investments they need to make in order to supply demand. Do I wish AMD stop stagnating in designs, yeah, RDNA3 needs to go, but these companies have motives in what they do.",Neutral
Intel,"We all saw it coming a mile away, when it came out in 2025 it was competing against discounted 4060 laptops as low as just $1000. Too little, too late, too expensive, dated on arrival with RDNA3.5, etc. But for some reason this sub and r / amd always have such a hard on at the concept of a ""big APU"" that in practice would never be economically sensible.",Negative
Intel,Arc 140T is already on par with the 890m for most tasks excluding games.,Neutral
Intel,Commercial failure indeed. Laptop with dGPUs at same price perform better. Laptops with solid CPU perf are much cheaper.,Neutral
Intel,AMD gave Strix Halo zero chance to compete by barely selling any of the lower end models. An 8 core with 32 CUs would be a great mini PC.,Negative
Intel,"I dunno Battlemage was a big step forward on driver compatibility and every month Intel improves all their Arc compatibility. I'd be honestly surprised if Xe3 was worse than their current offerings. I'm sure it still has shortcomings as all Intel GPUs will because they're simply starting fresh, but even my A750 is pretty good right now at playing anything I throw at it.  The only aspect Intel kind of messed up that annoys me is their video encoder, once it gets pegged to 100%, it absolutely tanks your performance on the capture to the point where it skips frames and lags. It never used to do that and the driver also used to include capture software, now they just offload it to people having to download OBS and removed the capture aspect of the driver. Kind of dumb when both NVIDIA and AMD include it as a driver option.",Negative
Intel,Driver support is better than ever and will continue to get better now that Intel has found its footing in the gaming GPU business (yes that includes igpus),Positive
Intel,"If TSMC does raise price on their node, Nvidia doesn't find another node for their lower-end bins and Intel can keep the price on their own node down low, we could see Nvidia simply slowly phasing out the -50 series like they used to do with the MX series.",Neutral
Intel,"The 4050 still has a sizeable memory bandwidth advantage, so it's still very surprising that the B390 comes so close.",Neutral
Intel,"oh damn, this should be a lot higher up! Most laptops have them clocked much higher so expecting 4050mobile performance is kinof a lie...",Negative
Intel,"I get the feeling everybody is still unsure where these PTL chips slot in to and what to compare these against actually. Once we get more info on pricing, power consumption, CPU performance etc. we will get some actually useful comparisons.",Neutral

Intel,The new MSI Prestige 16 looks nice.  They all seem to lack Thunderbolt 5 though.,Positive
Intel,"It seems the revived Dell XPS 16 will have the “B390” and no dGPU, as another option.

Intel,"$1100 for a little MSI 13"" laptop with one. there are also quite a few CPU SKUs that have the B390.",Neutral
Intel,"Those 16 cores are 4 performance cores, 8 efficiency cores and 4 “Low Power” efficiency cores. This is only doubling the core count of Lunar Lake, by adding the two plain efficiency core clusters. Or keeping the same core count as ArrowLake mobile’s 285H (not HX!), trading 2 performance cores for 2 “Low Power” efficiency cores.  I’m not 100% on this but I don’t think Stryx Halo used AMD’s C cores, so it basically had an entire 9950x attached to the iGPU.  Prices should be more normal, as this is more part of Intel’s normal lineup.",Neutral
Intel,There's an Ultra 5 chip with the B370 (10 Xe cores instead of the 12). Shouldn't be too costly,Neutral
Intel,It's 16 cores but it's only comparable to Strix Point 12 cores and not Strix Halo.      The highest end Intel chip here only matches the number of P cores in the M5,Neutral

Intel,Well unified core is supposed to be happening in the next couple of gens. Frequencies also seem to have taken a hit on 18A but I'd expect that to improve with time as usual,Neutral
Intel,Not really. They just need to not completely bungle gaming and latency sensitive performance like with Arrow.,Neutral
Intel,"This is about mobile devices, and since a high performing IGPU is included, the question is no longer how well the CPU performs in a system with a 5090 (what most cpu benchmarks focus on) but how well this IGPU/CPU combination performs compared to other IGPU/CPU combinations. I am positive the CPU is not the limiting factor in this IGPU performance tier, so ""leading edge CPU performance"" is not really relevant.",Neutral
Intel,"Don't think it's completely absurd. Should get some efficiencies from less interconnect overhead and lower power memory, so not quite 1:1 with a dGPU. If we were to budget, say, 40W for the iGPU in gaming and 20W for the rest, should be perfectly in line with the higher end laptop SKUs.",Neutral
Intel,Intel Arrow Lake already uses 80W just on the CPU side in multicore,Neutral
Intel,"It would be viable if AMD released their own small PCs with it to cut the MSRP of products, but they aren't interested.",Neutral
Intel,And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Of course we don't know the cost breakdown there as far as PS5 pricing goes.,Neutral
Intel,They just need to make the next iteration cost less. Most of strix halo's issues were the sky high price.,Negative

Intel,Too much listening to MLiD who has a boner for APUs,Negative
Intel,"Idk one can easily flip your statement. Panther lake coming in **2026** competing against continuing discounted 4050s prob less than 4060s. I don't dislike Panther Lake nor am I defending Strix Halo, but I wouldn't say your argument is a rather good one.",Neutral
Intel,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ymoiWv9BF7Q   It's already at least on par for reasonable power profiles unless you play stuck to the wall.,Neutral

Intel,Nvidia will find another cheap node to use. Samsung will gladly oblige,Positive
Intel,"153 GB/s vs 192 GB/s is not that ""sizeable""  And the comparison against ""HP OmniStudio X 32-c0077ng"" is weird, even in the linked test they have GPU-Z screenshot displaying 1375Mhz memory speed instead of 2000 Mhz on most other RTX 4050 Laptop Review.  I don't understand this comparison against an All-in-One, and I'll wait for more in depth reviews to draw some conclusion.",Negative
Intel,"PC World had power consumption tests under gaming loads. It pulled 60W through USBC with Cyberpunk, so probably 35-40W for the gpu. When they unplugged it, the benchmark numbers stayed the same. So it also pulls 60W on battery.  Unless the manufacturer actually configured the device to simultaneously pull energy from the cord and battery under full load.",Neutral
Intel,About as much as we have PTL laptops,Neutral
Intel,"TB5 isn't a big deal, although I don't like that they have a numpad keyboard, and usually MSI speakers are terrible.",Negative

Intel,"> I’m not 100% on this but I don’t think Stryx Halo used AMD’s C cores, so it basically had an entire 9950x attached to the iGPU.  I have a Strix Halo.  What you wrote is exactly what it is.  It's essentially a 9950x (so all P-cores) with a fat iGPU attached, and with a 4 channel memory controller instead of 2-channel.",Neutral
Intel,"The biggest difference between the P and E cores is fMax. The larger the core count becomes, the lower the all core clocks become, the smaller the gap between P and E core performance becomes.   The IPC difference between the two is like ~10%  At a certain point along the wattage curve, given a certain number of cores, there will be a point where E core performance can potentially meet or exceed what you would've gotten has you had too many P cores.    Its also more than just trading 2 P cores for 2 lpE cores. The lpE cores in ARL-H were *so* weak, they were functionally useless. In practice, it'll be more like trading 2 P cores for 4 lpE cores  edit: to be more specific, In ARL-H, below 5W per core, E cores outperform P cores. If you have 16 cores and are running all core workloads, then at 60W, each core is receiving less than 4W.",Neutral
Intel,No it's firmly ahead of strix its right in between. Strix point uses 8 ecores too and it gets demolished in multithread benchmarks as expected,Neutral
Intel,"It affects their margins. The more competitive and better QC is, the less Intel can charge OEMs for their CPUs.     AMD made them lower margins for laptop chips because they weren't very competitive. If they want fat margins, they need to be the best",Neutral
Intel,Single Core is very important when Intel is doing these designs that lack P cores throughout. The cheapest X2 Elite has the same amount of P cores as the most expensive Panther Lake SKU,Neutral
Intel,"Qualcomm is already super close with Oryon V3...  Perf/Watt for that single thread isn't close I guess, but absolute performance is breathing down Apple's neck for sure.  Also, don't compare Geekbench scores on windows vs Linux/Apple/Android... Windows just does something negatively about it and the difference is 5-7% vs non-windows.",Neutral
Intel,>Well unified core is supposed to be happening in the next couple of gens.  I would be shocked if this has much to do with a large performance uplift. I imagine it would have to do more with rightsizing core area and power draw.,Negative
Intel,Chasing above 5Ghz is stupid on laptops. It only matters for desktops,Negative
Intel,You are overly focusing on gaming. I mean general CPU performance,Neutral
Intel,Rtx 5050 is 61% faster than B390. I doubt if they change the wattage configuration and stick to 60W they'll match it. Unless the 5050 is capped to more reasonable wattages like 60-80W. Plus the 60W budget for Intel/amd will be used for other compotents and the apu budget reduces.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm talking out of my knowledge base, but I think the switch from heat pipes to custom vapor chambers means we are less bottlenecked at power density / pulling heat from the chip and more constrained at what the radiator/fan system can push out of the system.",Neutral
Intel,"They announced a first party Strix Halo PC at CES, but it'll probably be really expensive.",Neutral
Intel,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips. But if you want true performance, just go out and buy an RTX X060 series laptop it's far better price to perf each generation.",Neutral
Intel,"What is possible? PS5 uses GDDR6 instead of DRAM. And consoles are heavily subsidized by digital purchases. I bet AMD makes good money on PS5 (and Xbox X/S), Sony & Microsoft just subsidize the shit out of it with their 30% cut from selling games. Even the Steam Deck is barely profitable for Valve. High-end APU is just a waste of sillicon.",Negative

Intel,"It is probably because the AIO was one of their most, if not the most recent RTX 4050 tested (March 17th 2025) which probably enabled them to compare in newer title like F1 25 in the article, as it has already been around for like 3 years while RTX 5050 was released last year and received more attention in its place overall. From their database, the next most recent thing with RTX 4050 they reviewed was the Yoga Pro 7 in January 2025 with a 60W RTX 4050 (45 watts + 15 watts Dynamic Boost), which scored 50.8fps in Cyberpunk 2077 at the same setting and thus a bit lower than the AIO, so I would say the AIO is at an okay spot for a RTX 4050 to be compared to this Arc B390.",Neutral

If QC captures market share and reaches 10-15%, then Intel will start to sweat and then margins will be hit. I don't think QC gets anywhere near that till like 2028/2029.

Arrow lake (Desktop) at least closed on efficiency, but lacks a bit of gaming performance still, hopefully Nova Lake will be the step required to push more competition.   On GPU the same, AMD does not compete with NVIDIA in higher segments while NVIDIA is fairly comfortable with their setup and increases prices because they want to milk customers to increase their ridiculious margins (up to 70%) that they are used to from AI-Chips.   And now Intel also provides Multi-Frame generation, while a niche for me still, starting to compete with AMD and closes up to NVIDIA in terms of Software support, which they lacked the most and fixes a lot of problems.

This directly threatens Nvidia's consumer laptop volume in the entry segment. Intel is claiming close to 4050 performance at this lower TDP, and that's certainly good enough for many to not have the tradeoffs of having a dGPU in their laptop.  If the new market is moving towards putting GPUs on the CPU package instead of discretely on the board, Nvidia doesn't want to place all of their hopes on WoA becoming better, and are hedging by doing both their own SoC *and* an x86 APU with Intel.  The XPS line dropping Nvidia discrete all together is proof of this. In these sub 70W total laptop power markets, a discrete GPU is just eats into the power budget too much.",Neutral

Intel,The relative proportion of the die isn't as important as the die size itself and the node ofc.   Lunar lake for example has an estimated die size smaller than the hx370 so even if they did make the die bigger I don't think that is going to massively raise the price. Not to mention intel owns the foundry unlike AMD who are outsourcing to TSMC. This isn't in the realm of a strix halo competitor with a 300 mm\^2 + die size.

Intel,"They are using 9600mt/s lpddr5x, could also have a lot of cache, (iirc 890m configs were nerfed in cache because they wanted to put a npu instead), and also could be a synthetic benchmark or specific game that isn't very bandwidth heavy.",Neutral
Intel,Panther Lake still has a 128 bit memory bus so only models with 9600 mt/s will get slightly faster shared memory bandwidth than Lunar Lake.   I wonder how this will manifest in games as the only performance leaks have been from Geekbench and 3DMark which may not be as bandwidth intensive as real games and applications.,Neutral
Intel,"This seems to be correct, since checking NotebookCheck for the 30 watt 4050 shows that it’s around 70% faster than the HX370 in games, which is roughly where Intel places their iGPU.

Intel,The thing about that... what sort of tile are we expecting them to package up? As you say if we can get 4050ish performance from an Intel iGPU then they really can't be far off 5050M... and maybe even 5060M performance in future.  Do you think they'll offer something like a 5070 tile? that almost seems excessive (and difficult to actually package from a thermal point of view in a laptop) but it seems like the 5050/5060 sort of tier is going to be pretty well covered as a traditional iGPU soon.,Neutral

The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins. For all purposes it's an accounting trick to hide CCG's and DCAI's 5-15% operating margins if you divide the foundry losses per group revenue.",Neutral

Intel,"even if you exclude the CPU CCDs the graphics die alone is bigger than a RTX 5070Ti mobile GPU, which also retails for \~$2000-$3000, same as Strix Halo laptop",Neutral
Intel,"This is slightly splitting hairs but the 8c CCDs in Strix Halo is actually NOT the same chiplet as the ones in desktop zen 5 parts. It iirc is produced on a smaller node, slimmed down, and has different ( or no) TSVs.  It is similar to design and cache sizes to desktop however, but the changes to the CCDs were done to improve low power performance characteristics. They are likely a bit more expensive than Desktop CCDs.  I believe it is discussed in a chips&cheese deep dive.",Neutral
Intel,"AMD have largely been ""winning by doing nothing"" due to their better driver support stack for gaming on iGPUs, rather than actually throwing superior hardware at it.  It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.  Given how effective DLSS is on the Switch2, one could only imagine how kickass a Nvidia chip in a handheld PC could be with the far more ubiquitous DLSS support.",Neutral
Intel,Now they are not. The panther lake igpus are undisputed winners (excluding the 395+ from amd since it's just not gonna be mainstream). You can get a 358H or 368H and you'll have solid laptop for igpu gaming far cheaper than the 395+,Positive

Intel,"Well you said it, it's TSMC capacity, meaning also a priority issue. They prioritize AI over consumers and then increase the price by reducing availability, meaning the same chip costs more, meaning more margin.

A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.  Sorry for the rambling.",Neutral

Intel,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW? But yeah high end perf scaling falls apart at sub 4K internal res.",Negative

Intel,"Intel already talked about this a couple months ago. It's not an announcement here, but it seems people are more interested in AMD and Nvidia news so those threads don't get as much traction.",Neutral
Intel,I feel like more people paying more attention since the market’s grown a lot.   I remember old games I played in the early 2000s having micro and regular stuttering depending on the game. I chalked it up to “huh guess it’s loading in data as I play” when I didn’t know much.,Neutral
Intel,We are paying more attention to it but I suspect as we push higher frames with new engines and techniques the micro stutter is getting worse. It just starts becoming less perceptible to people than say the micro stutter from SLI and other stuff that caused issues in the past.,Negative
Intel,"I think digital foundry answered that question on their podcast. Compared to 15 years ago the frame rate is higher on average for most gamers, but it also stutters more. So it's huge fps with huge drops and hangs.",Neutral
Intel,"Worth remembering no one even gave a shit about stuttering enough to measure it until someone at I think it was anandtech back in the late 00s was so fed up with shitty perf on his crossfire system he started doing 1% lows on benchmarks.   Back in the 90s people would run like 6x SLI voodoos and not even care that the game hitched every 10 seconds down to sub 30s fps lol...  Edit: it's also key to remember that a lot of the games that stutter on PC these days stutter in the exact same places for the exact same reasons, and worse considering the lack of CPU power, on consoles. Console gamers just don't give a fuck lol....   DF did a good video showing this truth with the Silent Hill 2 remake.",Negative
Intel,"With a lot of PS3 games dipping to 20s, I guess we are just paying more attention to it now",Neutral
Intel,There was DF Clip of this exact question.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxsfT4c-F-Q,Neutral
Intel,They're more surgery stuttery.,Negative
Intel,Everyone hates MLID,Negative
Intel,Funny piece of lore. Why so?,Positive
Intel,Who's MLID?,Neutral
Intel,If the end visuals are better who cares. we already did a lot of such things in engine just didnt tell the players about it. One in four frames actually rendering shadows is a thing for example. Heck some games go as bad as once a second shadow updates.,Negative
Intel,"Well, I think that most people (myself included) don't really care how it's done if the end result is looking good and feel good to play, off course something like 30fps based with MFG to 120 is bs, but I quite regularly use 60 -> 120 using frame gen because It feels okay input wise to me at 60, and the added visual smoothness is quite nice. So it all depends how it's implemented and talked about.",Neutral
Intel,"yeah i had to tap out a couple months back. it's a shame, they did great work, but i refuse to support ragebait.",Negative
Intel,"Doesn't help that there isn't any particular new hardware to review or anything new besides AI, the PC industry has hit stagnation in the consumer market.",Negative
Intel,"In other news, guy who is being served turds at restaurant loudly complains about receiving fat dooks instead of food.     *""man that guy is such a whiner""*",Negative
Intel,"No it didn’t sound like they were going to use the MS shader delivery program. Or no, they said they want to, but they have their own solution that they’ll launch before that.   And I also don’t think the MS solution is ready. The ROG ALLY XBOX also doesn’t have this feature already as far as I know",Negative
Intel,"> The Shader delivery program was launched on an AMD handheld  i assume you're referring to the steamdeck, which to my understanding was done by valve... so the point kinda stands, you just add valve to the preamble.",Neutral
Intel,"I dunno I remember many games, especially based on Quake engine, being buttery smooth if you could get to reasonable FPS",Neutral
Intel,also more cause for stutering. Back then we could compile shaders real time with no siginficant issues because they were small. Now we have to compile shaders real time that are huge to the point where we pre-compile half of them before we even start the game.,Neutral
Intel,Console gamers *of certain genres* care.   The FGC rejected the idea of playing Street Fighter IV & MvC3  on PS3 because the Xbox 360 port had better input latency.   Even the PS4 port of USFIV wasn't liked.     Part of why I stopped going to tournaments is because SFV & Tekken 7 on PS4 always felt *off* compared to PC.,Negative
Intel,"Not really. In many cases, console versions of games just don't stutter whereas PC games do because modern games are mainly designed for consoles and then ported to PC.  A couple of good recent examples are Wukong and Outer Words 2. Neither of those games on consoles have the horrid stutters that are prevalent on PC.",Neutral
Intel,MLID more like MID,Neutral
Intel,He’s been calling Tom a “snake oil salesman” for performance claims on Alchemist,Neutral
Intel,"Moore's Law is dead, he's a YouTuber who makes predictions and purports to have insider information from Nvidia/Intel/AMD but in reality he is better described as FanFiction for PC enthusiasts.",Negative
Intel,"I worry about things like latency.  Or what happens when you move suddenly, or fire, and the whole image falls apart.  If the hardware can't do it all yet, then wait a few years instead of using these... methods.  And just to be clear, I think very highly of  Mr. Tom 'TAP' Petersen; I'm just not liking where this is all heading.  Are you happy with Borderlands 4 or Outer Worlds 2?  If you are then we live in two different worlds.",Negative
Intel,"There's plenty of old stuff he needs to review. I've said it before but I will say it again and beat it like a drum: He STILL has not reviewed the 9060 XT 8GB for instance. Plenty of content he could have farmed off that, especially BEFORE the RAM shortage where having an 8GB card was some sort of sin in his eyes (except for some reason he ignored it but raile roaded the cheaper RTX 5050, lol did someone say bias?). Instead, he just tore the 9060 XT 8GB down and never touched it again after that teardown. I'm sorry but there's GENUINELY stuff he could be doing instead of farming clicks about 'NVIDIA bad' and 'Intel pathetic', but that won't get him views from drama farming NVIDIA which is what he craves these days. So sad to see a big channel like his who got big off doing solid technical content become a drama-hype ""news"" channel.",Negative
Intel,No wonder that strategy has proved successful. There are a lot of people that only care about complaining and bitching. Which I get up to a point but it starts to feel childish and pathetic quickly.,Negative
Intel,"I love how reddit down votes you,  reddit posts all day complaining about the industry, GN does a video on it   Redditors ""whiney cry baby engagement farmers """,Negative
Intel,"Valve does have one on Steam, but Microsoft announced a store agnostic, eventually hardware vendor agnostic one launched with the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X last year.  It was supposed to be working already but there's no sign of it just like everything else Microsoft releases about gaming half-baked like their gaming UI, their attempt to unify upscaling, and Directstorage.   So I imagine they're referring to what Microsoft called ""Advanced Shader Delivery"" that they've done little with but name and announce to sell more Asus Pretend-Xbox's.",Neutral
Intel,I’m talking about the Xbox Ally as the other commented said,Neutral
Intel,We considered solid 60 or 75 smooth back then. Now at least I complain as soon as I can't stay above 100.,Negative
Intel,"Shader compilation stutter is a PC problem that’s been especially bad in UE4 and 5 since the transition to DX12. Other types of stutter and bad frame rates used to be equally bad on consoles, or even worse in the 360/PS3 era.",Negative
Intel,Outer Worlds 2 is fairly consistent for a UE5 game. To me its just very heavy,Neutral
Intel,"funny coming from MLID, notorious snake oil salesman",Negative
Intel,"Eeeegh, considering MLID overall story - can see that, can see that.  OTOH usage of such terminology - snake oil salesman - reminds me of that very infamous Intel presentation...",Negative
Intel,You say that as if we will reduce our base frame rate. But the direction of travel is to use MFG to drive the 480Hz and above monitors that will become more and more common in the future.,Neutral
Intel,I dont like borderlands franchise and i havent played Outer Worlds 2 yet so i cannot comment on them from personal experience. However things like Reflex/Reflex2 has actually decreased latency for me.,Negative
Intel,"I havent really seen it as some sort of drama farm, I think a lot of GN's videos do show how bad the current computer hardware hobby is doing and Im glad someone is focusing on that",Negative
Intel,Whata wrong with calling companies out? Like redditors cry all day but stop at GN when the channel brings up issues within an industry.  Sorry a person isn't running their channel the way the reddit collective wants.,Negative
Intel,"honestly, i had completely forgotten that was a thing.   i wish i had more faith in microsoft to pull this off, but i remain skeptical in basically anything they try until proven otherwise.",Negative
Intel,"People on gaming forums used to go around insisting the human eye could not distinguish greater than 60fps.  It was accepted as gospel in many places/by many people.  Granted, that was in the age of CRTs and almost no one had actually seen >60, but funny to think back on.",Neutral
Intel,snake oil salesmen dont like competition.,Negative
Intel,"MLID aka ""RTX 50 super will be released november 2025""",Neutral
Intel,this just makes me like tom more,Positive
Intel,"Replace that 60 with 30. Yes, people insisted we could not see more than 30 even while playing on 85hz CRTs.",Neutral
Intel,"Meanwhile quake players kept dropping resolution to hit triple digit refresh rates :) But yeah, it's wild that 30 was the norm for so long on console",Neutral
Intel,That's far from the worst prediction he's missed.  Remember SMT4 for future Zen architectures? 24 and 32 cores on desktop Zen4? L4 cache for Zen 4?,Neutral
Intel,Which Tom?,Neutral
Intel,"console used to lock at 60, dont know why they choose to drop down to 30.",Negative
Intel,"Because when the hardware cant handle all the sprites, it slows everything down including game logic which was tied to frame rate back then. It happens in plenty of hardware from snes to arcade cabinet.",Negative
Intel,"also happened the other way round, older games would run faster than they should because they tied it to framerate rather than delta time. This bad practice was so common you can still find studios like bethesda do this.",Negative
Intel,"for context, this G14 was the one that gave us [the first ever Geekbench scores for Panther Lake](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1ocaslx/panther_lake_geekbench_leak_its_good/) over on r/hardware",Positive
Intel,"The price probably wasn't going to be low enough compared with other SKUs.  In the past, Intel skuss with Iris HD etc were so expensive and were only included in $2000 ultrabooks. This is probably going to be same.",Negative
Intel,When I first learned about I was confused why it existed. Not surprised Asus decided to cancel it.,Negative
Intel,"It makes sense, a B390 only G14 kind of defeats the whole purpose of the Zephyrus, even as a base model.     Basically brings the GPU performance down to 3060 levels (actually a little worse than that), which is roughly 4 years ago at this point.",Negative

Intel,"It would have made _some_ sense, but the Arc B390 must’ve been real good. But as you say, with the raise in RAM prices, you can forget about it.  I wonder whether Intel themselves would pair a mid-range Panther Lake with a top-notch iGPU… It would make sense, since the high-end CPUs tend to have dGPUs.",Neutral
Intel,"For the Zephyrus you can also just disable the dGPU to game only on the iGPU, and the customers of the Zephyrus are minimum looking for a decently powerful dGPU",Neutral
Intel,I hope their plugged out power scheme is permanent and doesn't vary based on application,Neutral
Intel,"> so what's the point of having a powerful GPU on a laptop if I got to plug in all the time  I have a laptop for travelling. I travel to places that have plugs, and I don't need to use a laptop while I am actually in transit.",Neutral

Intel,"Useable, yes, but what customers of the Zephyrus are looking for, no.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, and it gets pretty good battery life on that and in power saving mode/60fps screen mode. Like 8 hours. Best I've had on a gaming laptop- not a high bar, but it's nice to be able to take it into the living room and use it light a normal laptop instead of it dying instantly.",Positive
Intel,Still better than 45 minutes  Also it can obviously be put in a lower power mode to save battery while not hurting performance too drastically.,Positive

Intel,"The B580 has 200W TDP, in a perfect world and TDP scales linearly, the B770 would be 50% faster, that would put it around the 5060Ti/9060XT.  If the price also scales linearly, that would be around 375€, seeing that the 9060XT is going for 350€ now, it's gonna be tough competition.",Neutral
Intel,Im really looking forward to panther lake X. 4-4-4 core configuration and Xe3 iGPU with sr-iov is perfect for running a Linux-Windows mixed vm environment without having to get a gaming laptop with a dedicated GPU for virtualisation.,Positive
Intel,I hope the Linux driver support and performance is good in these,Positive
Intel,"Intel ARC needs to maintain their momentum. They have an excellent pricing strategy and genuinely compelling features, it's time they released a card that competes in the midrange. And no, I don't count the A770. As a B580 owner, increased ARC adoption rates will be sure to benefit all cards in the range, so I really hope that intel is committed for the long-haul here.

Intel,"Scaling by TDP is not a good metric as they can pack more cores ect. and run them at lower, more efficient speeds. That however will mean a bigger die and viability might be questionable (considering they're already massive for the performance).",Negative
Intel,"Price doesn't scale linearly because die sizes make defects scale quadratically. so pricing is the same, 2 50mm\^2 dies are cheaper than 1 100mm\^2 die     However in GPUs there is a fixed cost for every GPU so there is a sweet spot",Neutral

Unless Battlemage is seriously memory bandwidth-limited, it should be almost 50% more performant.  The only question is die size.

Intel,"The B50 is not a gaming GPU and actually underperforms in gaming tasks compared the the B580. They need to have an actual range of cards, not just a budget option, and even more budget option, and a server/workstation GPU. The B770 is essential to compete in the midrange",Negative

Intel,"> Scaling by TDP is not a good metric as they can pack more cores ect. and run them at lower, more efficient speeds.

They can't really afford not to use every bit of die space they have for all that its worth.",Negative
Intel,"Battlemage doesn't have the ability to add more Xe cores per render slice, this is something Intel has changed for Xe3. The BMG-G31 will have 128 ROPs, the same as an RX 9070 XT, or more than an RTX 5080.",Neutral

Intel,"Geekbench’s scaling has always been problematic, and the differences between architectures are huge. The benchmark is very friendly to ARM and least favorable to AMD. Even a random Apple M5 chip can easily score close to 20,000.  Therefore, cross-architecture comparisons using Geekbench scores have little real meaning. The only valid reference is **same-generation, same-architecture comparisons**, such as between the 285H and 388H.  Based on the actual results, the improvements are about **9% in single-core** and **21% in multi-core**. Given that the 285H scores around **22,500** in Cinebench, I estimate that the 388H should be able to reach roughly **24,000**.  But the key point is **power efficiency at lower power limits**. For example, if the 285H needs around **80W** to reach 22,500, then the real question is:  * How much power does the 388H need to reach 22,500? * How many watts does it take to exceed 20,000?  This is what really matters. If the 388H can achieve 2**0,000 at 35W**, **22,500 at 60W**, and **24,000 at 80W**, then that would represent massive progress.

Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake are *not* using some outdated process — they use TSMC’s then-most-advanced N3B node, Intel’s first time adopting it. Meanwhile, Panther Lake uses Intel’s own **18A** process.  Based on the current benchmark results, Intel’s 18A appears to outperform TSMC’s N3B by at least the same margin that **Intel 4** trailed behind N3B — which is an astonishing result.  Every day you hear people saying how much TSMC has advanced, how far ahead its processes are, how “outdated” Intel’s nodes are, how AMD’s processors using TSMC have excellent efficiency.

Intel,"For the use cases of PTL, Geekbench (which is mostly consumer focused) is a good indicator.  It doesn't assume that its workloads are perfectly parallel, it assumes some threads are used more heavily than others, so its value in nT is influenced by its 1T.

It would also strongly indicate that Intel’s 18A node indeed offers significantly better energy efficiency than TSMC's N3B.",Negative

Intel,"Couple of subtests leverage some new arm vector instructions and get huge scores, but those have limited influence to the overall score.

One difference is that since geekbench is distributed as binary it’s compiled more directly for apple architectures specifically while others use more generic targets. But that has very limited effect.",Neutral
Intel,But they have a gpu compute test too,Neutral
Intel,"Geekbench claims it's much more realistic than those multicore tests that scale nearly perfectly with tons of cores, and I think that's a fair take. It's not as if they didn't know how to create a benchmark that scales like other nT tests do, geekbench 5 nT does that.   I wouldn't call it worse, just different.",Positive
Intel,Geekbench runs common workloads as they are commonly implemented. It gives you a score on how well a multi core implementation of that workload would actually run in that CPU.   I think that is far more useful than some perfectly parallel workload measuring max power and core count.,Positive
Intel,"I have carefully compared the various models across Geekbench, PassMark, and the differences between Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake. If my judgment is correct, the theoretical peak performance of the 484 in Cinebench R23 should reach around **24,500**; the 285H scores **22,500**. Compared with the 285H, it should be easier for the 484 to achieve high scores because its power requirements are significantly lower than the previous generation built on TSMC N3B.  Its peak performance will not be extremely strong because the frequency is not high. IPC is likely improved by around **10–11%**, but clock speeds drop by about **6%**. Overall, that means single-core performance should only rise by **4–5%**.  The improvement will be most noticeable in Geekbench. Since PassMark single-core also shows gains, the IPC uplift and resulting single-core increase should be quite certain. If Geekbench were the only source, it would still be questionable, but PassMark is more solid and has higher reference value.  Overall, in terms of peak performance, the uplift is average—around **10%**, close to that figure.  However, the real key is the **efficiency gains**. I believe they will be excellent. Compared with the 285H, which requires **65 W** to reach **20,000** points in Cinebench R23, I estimate that the **388H** may only need **40–45 W**.  I also estimate that the Cinebench R24 score should fall around **1300–1400**. Compared with Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 at **1950**, there is still a significant gap—but the two products differ drastically in scale.  Overall, Panther Lake’s greatest achievements lie in several aspects:  1. **Energy efficiency** — likely the best among all x86 products. 2. **Performance per mm²** — excellent. For example, the 484: if you look at its die shot, the total area of the CPU (including the CPU tile’s 4P and 4 LPE cores and all caches) is essentially equal to the die area of a traditional monolithic 8-core design. That means the 484 uses the same silicon resources as past 8-core chips, yet **no AMD mobile 8-core processor surpasses it**, either in raw performance or efficiency. 3. It also offers better performance-per-area than Qualcomm’s processors. The X Elite 2 has **18 cores**, including **12 “very large” cores**—similar in size to Intel P-cores—and **6 large cores**, each larger than Intel’s E-cores. The die area of this chip is **2.5× larger** than Panther Lake 484’s.",Neutral

Second is the memory itself, they need something with higher bandwidth (but that might be addressed with LPDDR6).  To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.  Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.

Intel,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.  EDIT: 8060S (Strix Halo) is \~18,000 for reference.  EDIT 2: 890M (strix point's top end) about 8,100, so the PTL 12Xe chip will smoke that.

Well, we already had rumors of Intel struggling to hit actual intended frequency-goals, no?  Though especially the actual performance-metrics of the node will be quite sobering I think.  The power-draw of these SKUs is supposed to be a TDP of *officially* 25W – In reality, these parts are allowed to draw as much as 55W (2+0+4 or 4+0+4) and 65/80W (4+4+4 and 4+8+4) respectively.  So it must be seen, if these parts are any more efficient in daily usage, or just a side-grade to Lunar Lake.",Negative
Intel,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power. A 10-15% frequency advantage would go a long, long way towards closing gaps if it comes as a relatively small power cost.",Neutral

Intel,">I can't say I'm entirely sold on the idea of having three core clusters humming inside my laptop.  From a user's perspective, CPU's are a blackbox and the inner-working details are irrelevant. What matters is results. They want, typically, a balance of performance, battery life, heat / fan noise, and cost, placing greater emphasis on one of these categories over the others.  The idea is that P cores = performance optizied  E cores = Area optimized  LP-E Cores = power optimized.  The theory being to have different core types focus on different parts of PPA.  E cores and LP-E cores are the same microarchitecture. Just LP-E cores are off-ring so the ring (and rest of the cores) can be powered down in light-load scenarios.  Intel's biggest problem is that looking at each of the cores, the P cores perform their designated role the worst. 200% larger than E cores for \~10% more IPC and \~15% more clockspeed is a pretty rough trade off - and by the time you've loaded all P cores and need to load E cores too, that clockspeed difference diminishes hard.

With fewer thermal constraints and much higher power budgets, they should be able to push well past the perf/W peak, where it should continue to scale well and for a long time before it starts hitting severely diminishing returns.  I'm not talking 300W monster CPUs, but the scaling between a 65W and 105W 18A CPU should be more significant than on current nodes, where you might gain like 10-15% additional performance from that 50% power bump.

For that you'd want to look ahead to 14A where the CFO mentioned on the earnings call (and he was somewhat realistic in other areas so it's more believable here) that 14A has been a positive surprise and they're actually pretty excited about it.

They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them.

Steam HW survey shows the most popular GPUs are still mid-range gaming cards, showing that discrete GPUs remain central to the PC ecosystem.  And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",Neutral

Intel,Fair. If your on a tight budget. Consider some of the RDNA3 AMD cards as well. I mean if your looking at a 3 generation old 3060 anyway. Something like the 7600 XT 16gb might be on the market where you are at a good price. Its probably 20% or so faster then a 3060.,Positive
Intel,"Check your GPU utilization in the game. If it's near 100%, then a GPU upgrade is the best option. But, I encourage you not to buy the RTX 3050. Try to get at least a 3060.",Neutral
Intel,Intel has GPUs for a while they got a pretty good budget option too (just some problems with it though) called the Intel arc b580. Anyways upgrading to AM5 is not viable as its Ramageddon so ram prices are horrendous rn. I recommend checking out the 5600xt or 5800XT CPU. As for the GPU try looking for a 9060xt 8gb or 16gb it's a pretty budget option that'll do you well. If you have a budget of around 200-300 get rtx 3060. Before all this though what's your PSU wattage,Neutral
Intel,"If you're open to getting used, might be able to upgrade both. Ryzen 5600 are ~100-120 USD used on Ebay or on Aliexpress (or look around for a local seller on Facebook Marketplace or /r/hardwareswap) and it drops right into your board to replace the 2600.

So it might actually be the last time you can snag a cheap used GPU.  Forget the 3050, a 3060Ti is an excellent value under $200. If you can find a 12GB version, you’ll be especially glad you did. I’d recommend a 4060 for the same price range, but your motherboard is most likely PCI gen 3, so a 30-series card is your best bet.

Intel,"The 9060XT is the stronger card. At 1080p don't even think about the 16Gb. Traditionally, AMD updates their cards and the performance grows more and more over time. Personally, I'd get the AMD card. The ""benefits"" you get from Nvidia cards are useless at a 5060 level of performance. The pure raster advantage of the 9060XT will last you longer",Positive
Intel,Arc Raiders came out 3 months ago. You're going to own that GPU for years. Buying a GPU for one specific game seems like a bad idea.,Negative
Intel,You will massively regret buying an 8gb card if you ever want to use a higher resolution than 1080p. The 9060xt 16gb is worth it. Better to save up and put off the purchase than to buy something you will be disappointed with.,Negative

The 5060 Ti is around 15-16% faster than the 5060 but if you can afford the 5060 Ti 16GB then I would suggest you to surely get it as it will be relevant for much longer in the future and Nvidia is going to stop production of the 16gb 5060 ti this year going from the rumours!,Positive
Intel,No AMD drivers are still buggy!

Intel,"Yeah i also moved to nvidia even though it is not allways the best price for performance because my last 2 AMD cards ( 5700xt and 6650xt ) could not run God Of War at all no matter the video settings or resolution, the game kept dropping to 30 fps, and it is a common issue with Amd and god of war games and they still have not fixed it.  There are more issues like this, some are fixable if you google the solution, some are not and after the thing with god of war i decided to give up on amd for now, they also didnt add FSR4 to previous gen GPU s ( like the 7000 series) , while Nvidia gave DLSS 4.5 even to the first RTX cards.",Negative

Intel,You are welcome to make your assumptions and share your own experience but I can only speak based on my experience with them and what I observe from my reddit scrolls! I switched to the Green Side and won't be going for a new Radeon GPU anytime soon.,Neutral
Intel,"You can play Arc Raider at max settings and you wont run out of Vram, personally  i never ran out of vram because i dont allways play the latest games ( i play at 1080p )  In the Game Indiana Jones ( which is a very bad optimised game )you have to set the settings to medium to not run out of vram and i think in the new Doom you have to use high, thats it, in some future released games you might have to use high/medium instead of ultra.  When you run out of vram the game gets very bad frame drops.  I play Cyberpunk on a mix of high and very high i think and i dont have any issues with vram for example, same for BF6.  At 4k resolution the vram issues appear in newer titles",Neutral
Intel,At 1080p you will almost never run into a VRAM issue and Nvidia cards are also more efficient in VRAM utilisation! They are also much more power efficient i.e. they will consume less power for the same level of performance which saves some electricity while also giving your power supply more headroom!,Positive
Intel,Can you go find a 5700xt and run that until you've saved for a  16GB card?  If you ever wanna move to the TV or even a better monitor 8GB is gonna be out gunned real fast.,Neutral
Intel,"Oh right yeah 😅  I don’t even own a TV, that wouldn’t cross my mind.",Neutral

Start with 253/253 standard Intel would be 125/253/304A and keep lowering that until there is no more thermal throttling. After that you can fine tune with undervolt etc.  And ofcourse check AIO mounting, pump, fluid.",Neutral
Intel,For both 12th and 13th gen you can do the following:  - turn hyperthreading off - enable only 8 ecores - Set a negative voltage offset of - 0.050  Play games for a couple of hours if no crashes then decrease offset by another 0.025 (I.e. 0.075). And keep going till you find the lowest voltage without crashes. This will increase 1% lows tremendously in games too.   Once you're stable and if temps are still too high (thermal throttle) then you can reduce clock speed by 100hz and keep doing it till you're happy. Reducing by 200mhz doesn't hurt gaming performance.  Benchmark a CPU limited game (or make it CPU limited by lowering the resolution) before you start so you can see the gains.,Neutral

Intel,Sadly it costs $350 here. I considered that too but it's out of the budget. Btw thanks!,Negative
Intel,"The 225F is a very current CPU, there are many people who will try to pair this with something like an i3-6100 or Ryzen 1400.",Neutral
Intel,Used rtx 3060ti for 250 or less. Fantastic value card now a days.,Positive
Intel,"So the 9th gen is a bit of a weird CPU right now, you do have a couple of decent upgrade options, but also you cannot go past the 9th gen without a new motherboard. Also the 9th gen is quickly coming up on 6 years old now as well.   My affordable advice would be to grab a 9700k and a better CPU cooler, then you can start to worry about the GPU which is very PSU dependent anyways. Without knowing the PSU I cant really make a suggestion anyways.   But the truth is, I would almost start fresh. New mobo, cpu, PSU and GPU. It would be more pricy, but also a far better use of your money than dumping it into a system that will be too slow to run new games in just a year or two.",Neutral
Intel,"I mean, really both kinda. 6500 XT is a notorious shite GPU but the games you play are CPU bound so a new CPU would do wonders. Budget is needed here.",Negative
Intel,"I have the ASRock H310CM-HDV with an i5-9400. The beta BIOS will add Smart Access Memory (a.k.a., resizable bar). This may improve GPU performance...depending on game.  An i9-9900 is in the $200+ range. An i7-9700 is in the $100+ range. The i9-9900's \~24% performance gain is questionable for \~100% increase in price. There are other options between your i3-9100f and the i7-9700...  Before dropping Benjamins on a new GPU, consider an overclock and undervolt of your 6500 XT:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxSLrvoejhg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxSLrvoejhg)  If the OC/UV yields ""good enough"" improvements, then you might be able to bypass the premiums being demanded in the current PC component market.",Neutral
Intel,"All the games you play avoid the problem of having a weak but modern gpu very well. Assuming you dont suddenly decide to play something more graphically intensive i reccomend upgrading your cpu seeing how it feels, then upgrading your gpu. The immediate option that comes to mind is the i5 9400f. It should be an approximate 25%-30% improvement in most of the games like cs2 due to the added cores, threads and clock speed compared to that fairly weak i3 cpu. Then you could do something like an RX 6600 for $120 if findable, if not I usually reccomend the 3060 12gb as a braindead midrange option still able to play anything, it's about 200.",Neutral
Intel,Get a 12th or 13th Intel i5 CPU and a decent GPU like the 5060 Ti or the 9060XT,Neutral
Intel,"What is your budget for upgrades?  Your GPU is currently being held back by your platform. The 6500XT only has PCIe x4, and LGA 1151 only has PCIe 3.0. 3.0x4 bottlenecks the card pretty badly, going from on par with an RX 580 to worse than an RX 570. Getting onto a newer platform with PCIe 4.0 would improve both your CPU and GPU.",Negative
Intel,"What you could/should upgrade depends entirely on budget. The CPU is nearly the slowest 9th gen Intel chip, so an upgrade there would help a lot. The ""Best In Slot"" CPU is the i9-9900K but those go for nearly $200 on eBay. You can find an i7-9700 for half that and while it's 50% faster multicore, it's only 10% faster single core and most games just use one or two cores, but there are exceptions: research which games you play to check. Fortnite and Arc Raiders can be CPU bound, so the i7-9700/K might help you out a lot with those games, or really any open world, multi-player type game. The GPU is also the slowest of the 6000 series. As far as new GPUs go, the Intel Arc B580 12GB at $250-$300 or the Radeon RX 9060XT 16GB at $380-$400 are best bang for the buck on the cheaper side, your options really open up on the used market. Go to the [Techpowerup specs page](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-6500-xt.c3850) and check out the Relative Performance of your card with faster ones. I would upgrade to something at least 200% relative performance or higher if you can afford it. Between the GPU and CPU, I'd say the GPU upgrade should take priority over CPU. While a much newer GPU might be bottlenecked by the 9100F, its vastly superior performance will leave the 6500XT in the dust. GTX 1080ti (\~$150) RTX 2080ti (\~240) RTX 3060ti (\~$220-250) RX 6750XT ($280-350) RX 6800 (\~$300) RTX 3080 (\~$350) all examples of decent used options that are considerably more powerful than the 6500.",Neutral
Intel,Adding a 9700K isn’t gonna fix the fact the GPUs being bottlenecked by PCIe 3.0.  An R5 3600 and a cheap B550 board would probably cost not much more than an 9700K and improve the GPUs performance quite a bit. It would still work with the 16GB DDR4 they already have.,Negative
Intel,I have seen many videos on how it is a bad card I haven’t had no problems so far but definitely on my list,Neutral
Intel,LGA 1700 isn’t worth recommending at all. DDR4 performance has aged terribly because newer games are more memory demanding. DDR4 boards have also gone up in price a lot.   HUB revisited the Ryzen 5000 series last week and included a 12400F on DDR4 and DDR5 for comparison (https://youtu.be/RijAyVshtok?si=NbuCRlSV4uhHOzlv) - the 12400F on DDR4 performs closer to an R5 5500 nowadays than the R5 5600 it used to compete with.,Negative
Intel,"I have not seen anywhere near that level of bottleneck from even this level of pcie mismatch. Cool you have pet issues, but this is about the cheapest possible options for the platform (and use case) at hand.

Intel,https://www.tomshardware.com/news/rx-6500-xt-pcie-gen3-gen4-tested,Neutral
Intel,"What? A lot of the review coverage for the 6500XT was about how bad the PCIe bottleneck is. The 6400 and 6500XT are unique in that they’re PCIe x4, even current lower-end cards like the Arc B570 and RTX 5050 are PCIe x8  https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-pci-express-scaling/28.html TPU saw a 24% drop from 4.0 to 3.0 at 1080p  https://www.techspot.com/review/2398-amd-radeon-6500-xt/ Techspot saw a 22% drop in averages and 25% drop in lows from 4.0 to 3.0 at 1080p   I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s even worse nowadays, games demand more VRAM now than they did 4 years ago. More VRAM the card doesn’t have = higher PCIe bandwidth need = more bottleneck when you don’t have bandwidth  A cheap upgrade like an R5 3600 + B550 board would not only improve CPU performance substantially coming from an old 4c4t CPU, but give the GPU the PCIe 4.0 it needs.  If you don’t know what you’re talking about, don’t comment lol",Negative
Intel,"Yes, I’m not stupid.  You are far better off going for Zen 3 over anything on LGA 1700.   The R5 5600(X) performs as well with DDR4 as the 12400(F) does with DDR5.  Used they both go for ~$100-120, new both are ~$170 right now. AM4 boards tend to be cheaper and the RAM is the exact same.  Why would you spend more on LGA 1700 to get worse performance?",Neutral
Intel,"My real-world experience with low-end cpu power and this mismatch on those titles is 10%. It isnt worse than having that i3 does to cpu-bound situations. Upgrading a bad platform is probabaly not his best price to dollar, but it is the nuanced situation he's in. if he can sell what he has for the price it goes for, going ryzen is always correct. However his cpu and all the others here are bad. If he can simply get a better part price on a single chip, he can get equivalent value from the upgrade compared to going ryzen.",Negative
Intel,You can get an i5 13600k with better performance than a 5800x. Also it is difficult to find the AM4 X3D CPUs these days so the intel route makes sense. He can later upgrade to a 14900k even which no AM4 CPU can match in terms of performance,Positive
Intel,"Weren’t you recommending upgrading to a 9400F?  Sure, the 9100F might be the limiting factor right now, but you’re still gonna hit the same PCIe bottleneck. It’s just gonna be more pronounced.",Neutral
Intel,"13th gen pricing is crap so I’ll use 14th gen for comparison, it’s basically the same  14600KF is $245 new and $180-200 used. It has a 181W PL2 so you need a board with good power delivery to not throttle it, especially if you want an upgrade path. The cheapest DDR4 boards you can get right now that fit the bill are $140.  5800XT is $219 new and $150-170 used. AM4 boards are still cheap, there’s plenty of quality B550s for $100.  Going Intel over AMD would cost at least $60 extra and most of the performance gains you would see using DDR5 on the 14600KF would be wiped out using DDR4",Negative
Intel,"It'll then axtually be the bottleneck. When you get something with a normal pcie layout, possible even the same value as his current card, that utterly disappears. A 6600 would be a great upgrade from that position...",Neutral
Intel,"There is a high-end bias with this platform, like any. It helps a lot to understand that budget systems fall within their spec, it is only the highest-end and lowest-end options of this era that stretch the pcie issue... there are cycles of alarmist narritives in all media. That one is old news that likely shouldnt have been printed imo.",Neutral
Intel,You’re going to hit the large PCIe bottleneck the moment the CPU isn’t terrible. It’s not gonna take much of a CPU upgrade for a GPU worse than an RX 570 to become the issue.,Negative
Intel,Im pretty sure a 9400f isnt gonna cause an issue here man... ive used this platform before. Then his pc is worth something...,Neutral
Intel,Youre giving me nothing against the clear narritives youre following over substance of experience with this shitty level of cpu performance.,Negative
Intel,"Do you respect at all the starting position he is in or are u just an advice salesman? Both of our ideas coexist. selling his current pc for more than its worth and just buying a dirt cheap 2nd gen ryzen with a sane gpu for the same money, then upgrading from there is also perfectly correct. That is a similar level of effort to a platform swap, or whatever you would prefer, which is also correct. The only bad advice here wastes more time and money than his original choice of platform already sealed. Also ur just wrong about pcie bottlenecks im pretty sure",Neutral
Intel,"I’m making the reasonable assumption that the person running a 9100F + 6500XT in 2026 doesn’t have a ton of money to spend on upgrades lol  Upgrading the current platform makes no sense without also upgrading the GPU. You can’t get very far with CPU upgrades on an H310 board, anything higher than an i5 is gonna be throttled.   Swapping in a cheap PCIe 4.0 CPU + board like an R5 3600 + B550 will improve both the CPU and GPU performance while not spending a ton of money. It also opens the door to future upgrades to something like an R7 5800XT which will hold up far better with a GPU upgrade.   I gave you multiple reviews showing 20+% losses on PCIe 3.0. That’s not opinion, that’s fact. That loss is going to be the same regardless of how good or bad your CPU is as long as the CPU isn’t the bottleneck.",Negative
Intel,I genuinely wonder what u get living in the idealized world where pcie 3.0 sucks ass below the highest-end 4.0 products and visa-versa. My dad was rly into the ideas of mearsheimer and I luckily biocontained his ass before that fkers gone and made the meme rounds again. You listen to Armand Hammer?,Negative
Intel,"Yea. Your advice is fine and wasnt the target of my statements, I added the last comment as proof I agree a platform swap is a totally good option. He doesnt even need to change his cooler for a 9400f and can then get a normal gpu for a similar value to his current one. This process is much simpler and has the potential to grant equal value if the chip is recieved for a low enough bargain, increasing the chances of finding a dreal given limited time. Do we disagree that we are both good at selling advice? I am still completely debating the validity of your sicituational understanding of pcie bottlenecks in relation to low cpu power circumstances, partially because of ur choice of sources, and ur disintrest in confronting that statement. His pc can gain value whilst spending little, my option is simply the lowest I coukd imagine.",Positive

Intel,Get yourself a GTX 650,Neutral
Intel,"Honestly there’s no “wrong” GPU to slot in with the rest of your build (although getting something lower tier than the options you stated would probably be a bit of a waste)  The 9800X3D gives you so much headroom that unless you’re going for crazy high FPS @ 1080p (which you’re not), it will be more than enough to pair with any GPU.   I think the 5070 Ti and 9070 XT are the most common “sweet spot” for value/performance atm, but if you ever see a good deal on a 5080 then that’ll obviously be a bit better.   My main word of advice would be, don’t stretch your GPU budget too far at the expense of the monitor. You don’t have to go crazy or anything, but a quality monitor will improve your experience quite a bit more than a few % better performance from the GPU imo",Neutral
Intel,"Without productivity needs, it'll come down to how long you plan on keeping it. If you plan on keeping it for 5 years or less, the 9070 XT if the price is cheaper. If you plan on keeping it for more than 5 years, I'd lean towards the 5070 TI since Nvidia seems to have better long term support.",Neutral
Intel,Nvidia way overpriced get the 9070xt,Negative
Intel,5070ti or 5800 if budget is 1k ish.,Neutral
Intel,"With a 9800X3D, anything less than a 5080 is just a waste of CPU speed.  Edit: for the people downvoting, here's the proof: https://www.techspot.com/review/3017-ryzen-9800x3d-vs-7600x-cpu-scaling/",Negative
Intel,I would suggest a 7800x3d with the money saved go 5070 ti or even 5080.  The new DLSS 4.5 for Nvidia cards is fantastic.,Positive
Intel,"At 1440p definitely the 9070 XT is definitely the choice.  I mean maybe even consider the 5070 non ti...  The 5070ti though with Nvidia's DLSS and multiple Framegen offer a better 4k upgrade path though, and probably longer term viability at 1440p...6-8yrs would be my guess....if you can find an msrp 5080 also another option.   Screen size you want to go with is probably most important, anything bigger than 27"" 4k is a must imo.   The DPI is more noticeable than the graphics settings being highest imo.  That said I'm running 9070 XT/9800x3D currently playing 90% Arc Raiders at 4k with FSR3 quality and Framegen I get 210-240 fps.   That said this was stop gap for me, I really wanted a 5090 but not at $3k+.    So I will upgrade in 2027 or whenever next gen mid/high tier cards come out.   Right now the 9070 XT is doing what I need.     This has youtube compression so not the best judge of quality but you can get an idea of what the 9070 XT can do at 4k.  Also has the performance metrics in upper right.

Intel,"My only gripe with the 9070xt is that it's DDR6 vs the DDR7 on the 5000 series gpu. It upsets me because even my 3080 (5+ years old now) used GDDR6X. Though the AMD is more primed to save during the ram crisis, I would always want the fastest possible clock speeds to future proof (will help with the AI models of DLSS/FSR).  You probably will be fine with either, but that's what turned me off from AMD. Performance wise, AMD is a much better value, but this graph for CS2 also turned me off from getting AMD (note that most other games are comparable between 5070 ti and 9070 xt):  https://www.techpowerup.com/review/sapphire-radeon-rx-9070-xt-nitro/11.html",Negative

So yea in most circumstances you won’t be stretching it to the limit, but that means you don’t have to think about upgrading it for a longgggg time - and every build always has some limiting factor.

Intel,"Basically the Nvidia feature suite. FSR4 is good but not as good as DLSS4 and now we have DLSS 4.5 which is another step up.   DLSS frame generation is also better than the counterpart from FSR but many people may not want to use frame generation at all.  If you play any ray traced title, although 9079XT does run these games pretty much as fast as 5070TI, the image quality will be worse than 5070TI because AMD just has way worse ray reconstruction (even the new FSR ray construction exclusive to the new CoD game is still a lot worse than the Nvidia counterpart). 9070XT also performs worse than 5070TI in path traced game.  But I am not sure about things like driver stability. I know it is something AMD had been accused a lot in the past but from my own experience the driver for GeForce 50 series at June/July last year was downright horrible, like games literally freeze at unacceptable occurrences. It has been largely fixed at this point but some of the issue remains. Like forcing anisotropic filtering on still causes artifacts in many games",Neutral
Intel,"I don’t know a ton about the current market but I just got a 5070ti a week ago at microcenter and both were at msrp but my understanding is for the extra 150$ (at msrp) you’re paying the nvidia tax ofcourse but other than that slightly better dlss support in games and driver support over the years based off what I’ve read, then frame gen which you certainly don’t need but for me it means I can stretch the life of the card for 2-3 years longer and jump up to 4k if I want to. Native performance is basically identical so really you can’t go wrong between saving money and frame gen I’d say it depends how long and how hard you’re going to be pushing the card.",Neutral

Intel,"Not worth getting a 14600K / KF and a 5070 Ti? The 5080 tends not to be worth it for price to performance when compared to the 5070 Ti.  There were some 5070 Ti models for £750 last week, but looks like they’re going up in price now, but that CPU and GPU combo total price should be about the same price as a 5080",Negative
Intel,"I'm using a i5 12400f with a 5070ti so almost the same as you, i did overclock and undervolt mine so might be even somewhat closer in performance 3075mhz with 0.925mv to you.   I do have 2k and 4k texture mods installed and multiple other mods so maybe the fps i get may not be what you see on vanilla cyberpunk and even slightly higher for vanilla.   Yes you will still be cpu limited in cyberpunk for me 1440p no ray tracing or PT i get 70-100fps the 70fps is the extreme dips and this is with every setting maxed except for crowd density at low   I also pulled up intel present mon and took a look at cpu busy and gpu busy this tells me how quickly one is sending information to the other, generally you want the cpu busy and gpu busy to be the same so that one is sending and completing the instructions at the same time and speed.   So with my hardware/mods and settings my cpu busy was 8ms and gpu busy was 6.5ms so my gpu was definitely waiting on my cpu for a bit.   With pathtracing on i dropped down to about 50-60fps.   Keep in mind though this is with quite a few texture mods and them being either 2k or 4k and also this is with preset M.   I'm currently getting the i5 14600kf arriving in 1-2 days since i want better shader compilation times as well since dear lord it takes a while for some.  Arc raiders while i haven't played the game i'm pretty sure as like any other live service online fps game will be quite cpu intensive rather than gpu intensive based on their style of graphics and how it's done so you should be limited by the i5 12400 as well as for how much sorry i don't have any data for you.",Neutral

Intel,"Hi op, I recently upgraded to a 5070ti and also have a 12400f.  Im on 3200mhz of ddr4 ram and playing at 1440p as well.  In some games like Arc Raiders, God of War, and Control, everything is perfect. GPU utilization is 99%.  However, im seeing a number of issues in several games. For instance, CP2077 has my GPU utilization at 65-70% and at ultra preset, no RT or dlss, im getting 80fps, while I see others with this gpu get 120. I know its a cpu botleneck bec when I leave the city and go to open areas, the utililization jumps to 99% and im getting like 120-130 at times even.  Likewise, several games like Space Marine 2, Outer Worlds 2, Spider Man Remastered, and more all sit at like 70-85% GPU utilization. Delta Force is at 59% (still 144fps tho) , Helldivers 2 sitting at 50% GPU utilization and a terrible 60 fps average. Starfield bounces from 60%-80% in the Jameson area and and gives me 60fps on average. Some drops to 55 fps too.  Whats more, DLSS options make no difference at all because of the bottleneck.  I can go from DLAA to DLSS Ultra performance without gaining any extra fps. This is a massive bad point considering how nice DLSS is these days.  Even among the games that give me 99% gpu utilization, Arc Raiders is the only that gives me DLSS performance gains. That game is just beautiful, giving me 100+ at cinematic settings, native res.   But for the other games, I literally have a 13600kf ready to be opened and installed (waiting on the cooler).  With a 5080, you are def going to see some bottleneck. So def consider a 13600kf/14600kf (they both identical in perf so get whichever is cheaper)",Neutral

Intel,Would you say a 5070ti should also be considered or not?,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah I am looking at my current options of upgrading to something like a 14600kf, which I think would solve my problems? I could always upgrade to that after a few weeks or months if I find the bottleneck too hard. Has the issue with the Intel cpu's later gens been fixed?

Intel,I have the B660 AORUS MASTER Ddr4,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah the 5070ti I was looking at (msi gaming trio) is around £920, compared to like £1240 of the Rtx 5080. I'm just paranoid if I didn't go for that extra bump that I'd regret it later. If I went for the 5070ti, I could definitely afford the new cpu (like a 14700kf or such) in one go too.",Neutral
Intel,"This is a really helpful, thank you so much. Can I ask, with your current combo how is your general performance in whichever games you play please? I am considering dropping to a 5070ti and a cpu upgrade instead.  As for arc raiders performance, on the max settings, it's still capping out my fps with dlss balanced at around 60 (although I'm using fsr 2x fg), as it has global illumination and stuff so I do think while there are moments I'm cpu limited there's also very intense graphical stuff, but if I upgraded gpu it would definitely be held back more by the cpu",Positive
Intel,"Thank you so much, this is incredibly useful. Where I am you actually can't get 13600s (or any 13th gen), so I was thinking to do as you said, and get a 14600k, or 14700k, though the latter is like 50% more for hardly any gain.  But thank you so much, esp for the arc raiders ones as I always felt it might be cpu limiting but it's good to know it's more gpu.  (also this is completely irrelevant, but have you tried the frame gen in anything yet? I've tried things like fsr frame gen and lossless scaling and typically don't experience much issues with them or mind, and I can only imagine how good nvidias one will be)",Positive
Intel,Its the 3rd best GPU on the market with a 4 year old budget CPU. There is absolutely going to be a noticeable bottleneck in many games,Positive
Intel,"So yes, your board would support up to 14th gen Intel CPUs, and looks to have a high quality VRM, so shouldn't struggle at all with even the highest end CPUs.  I'd suggest grabbing the GPU and seeing how it performs in the games you play, and looking into upgrading the CPU if some aren't meeting your expectations.   The 14400 isn't much of an upgrade over the 12400, but you can currently get a a 14600kf for ~$220 US, which is a notable upgrade over both the 12400 and 12600.",Positive
Intel,"Pricey that one, I’ve been using the cheaper Gigabyte Windforce 5070 Ti with no issues, sure there’s no fancy lighting but it seems dead quiet. Running it with a 13900K and never had any performance hiccups with Red Dead 2 and Cyberpunk at 1440p Ultrawide.  Amazon have the MSI GAMING Trio 5070 Ti for £840 atm and some cheaper on their Used Like New option. You’d still be looking at like £400 more for a 15% - 20% performance increase.  I guess if go all out for the 5080 and do end up needing to upgrade your CPU, then you can get a few hundred if you sell your 3080 and use the funds from that.",Neutral
Intel,"Games i play or played, final fantasy 7 rebirth, Expedition 33, kcd2, alan wake 2, the last of us part 1, space marine 2 all of these is with quality setting and preset M   Final fantasy 7 rebirth 66% resolution scaling (this game doesn't have balanced weirdly so you're only able to set 33, 50, 66 and 100%) at 66% i'm roughly at 115-130fps. (Also do note i have some 4k texture mods installed).   E33 is about the same quality setting at 90-100fps no frame gen.   kcd2 unfortunately i haven't had time to play it so i can only give you starting area fps which is about 100-120fps, it'll probably tank like 15-25fps once you get to kuttenberg with the amount of npcs they have.   alan wake 2 is about 80-95fps in the nursing home, i don't have a save to load into the more intensive area which is about the forest area near the start of the game.   The last of us part 1 is 90-105fps.   Space marine 2 is where you will struggle abit with the i5 12400, during small fights and running you will be about 80-90fps but once you start going into the big battles you will drop to about 60-70fps.   Oh for when BF6 was in the testing phase i was getting about 85-100fps during that play session not sure if this helps with anything for you.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, id get the 14600k then. It's more than fine for a 5080/5070ti.  Yes, Arc runs perfectly as is.  And yes, frame gen has been incredible, honestly. While the messaging about how it's useless when you're below 60fps is accurate, it is actually beautiful if you like having high fps.  For example, in Outer Worlds 2, my FPS in the town area drops to 54-57 fps. However, multi frame gen, gives me a very comfortable high refresh experience. Likewise frame gen in arc raiders, space marine 2, and indiana jones feel really good.  I also have the Lossless scaling app and honestly, Nvidia frame gen is several times better. I remember testing out lossless scaling in several games and the only game where it felt nice was in Kingdom Come Deliverance 1. However, in games like helldivers, the input lag was very noticable even if you had 60fps base.  Here's another amazing part about 5000 series. Smooth motion. I discovered it only recently and if you weren't aware, its the driver side implementation of frame gen. With the nvidia app, I can turn it on in almost any game, including old ones like control and games like Enshrouded which dont come with any frame gen.  let me tell you, even this driver level frame gen is so much better than lossless scaling. I was recording benchmarks with my 12400f yesterday just so that I can have a comparison when I make the switch and something funny happened. I was playing helldivers and was wondering why I was getting 120 fps. I had remembered it being 60fps earlier. For a moment, I thought my CPU had become unthrottled or that a mew patch had droppeed with massive fps improvements. However, I suddenly realized that I had simply enabled smooth motion earlier. It's legit like native 120 fps and I didnt even realize it.  Of course, dont' expect it to make 60fps feel nice if you only have 30fps (Thankfully, that will never happen right now with this tier of cards as even Path tracing on cp2077 gives me like 55fps). However, who knows what magic nvidia will cook up next. Dynamic frame gen might be super interesting to try in spring as well.  I was this close to actually getting a 9070xt. However, after experiencing frame gen, both native and driver level, and now the new and improved dlss4.5, im so glad I trusted my gut and went Nvidia. It came at a massive price here in India as well (like $965) but when im dropping big money on a card, Id rather get the best feature set than save what is a negligble amount in the context of the  4-5 years I will be using the card.      I am only envious of the dudes with DDR5 memory because that adds a good 20% extra performance in a ton of games apparently. But I guess it's not good to be too greedy haha.",Positive
Intel,"Thank you so much, after your comment I did come to think that upgrading down the intel line was still an option (I obv didn't do it before because of the issue, and in my mind currently I'd just ruled out cpu upgrades because of the whole ddr5 prices, and forget about 14th gen Intel)  I am in the UK so prices are a little more, but I could definitely go for like a 14600 or such. Is there much difference between the like 4600kf and like 14700? I will be upgrading my cpu so I should probably go for a higher than 850w if I plan to upgrade my cpu given I just saw the 14600kf is a 125w",Positive
Intel,"The ""f"" indicator on the CPUs means that it's a version with the internal graphics chip disabled, which is generally not a problem if you're going to have a dedicated GPU, and shouldn't effect performance.  The ""k"" indicator means that the CPU has a higher max power draw, and that it's unlocked for overclocking. To overclock, you also need a Z-series motherboard. The higher max power draw does mean that even with your B-series board, the ""k"" CPU will be able to run slightly faster than the ""non-k"" variant of the same CPU, usually translating to around ~5% more performance in real world scenarios.   The 14700k(f) is 0-10% faster at most vs the 14600k(f) in gaming workloads, depending on the game, so the 14700 non-k would be even less of a difference vs the 14600k(f). There's generally no reason to go for a non-k variant over the k variant if it's not cheaper, and the same goes for the f CPUs. In the UK, it looks like the 14600 non-k is not available anymore from major retailers, and the 14600kf is about £20 cheaper than the 14600k, so probably worth saving the money with the f model in your case.  I usually use this as a quick reference for power supply requirements with CPU + GPU combinations: https://www.msi.com/blog/recommended-psu-table  You can see that for an Intel i7 CPU with the RTX 5080, they indicate that an 850w PSU should be fine if you aren't looking to overclock, so as long as your PSU is a good quality 850w, I wouldn't worry about the power draw.   On the other hand, the 5080 uses Nvidia's new 12pin HPWR connector, which requires an (included) adapter to be used with older PSUs. This connector has a pretty bad reputation for pulling power unevenly and *melting* if the connections are not secure, so most people advise to use power supplies with native 12pin HPWR connectors if possible, to avoid extra points of failure. If you're careful (or if your PSU has these connectors natively - it's usually indicated on the box as ATX 3.0 or ATX 3.1), then it *shouldn't* be an issue, but these connectors are very finicky, so people are usually quite cautious about them.   The only other thing to note is that DDR4 does tend to effect the performance of these CPUs vs DDR5, which can range quite a bit depending on the game, with a few edge-cases actually running better on good quality DDR4 (games that prefer memory latency vs speed). This also effects 12th and 13th gen CPUs, so the performance differences between CPUs will still be the same in a relative sense, when both are using DDR4.",Neutral
Intel,"Thank you so, so sooo much <3 you are literally the best person ever, thank you  As for F, looking on the sites in the UK they generally seem to be around the same price as non F, so in that case I think I will grab a none F just in case of like, a gpu issue. Similar with K, the K are only marginally more expensive so I would definitely go with that over a none k.  As for 14700k vs 14600k, the 14700k is about £100 more than the 600, does that justify the price enough? The only other thing I can think of is for the 14600k the only version in stock for me is the F version (the others are all out of stock), so it's around £200 for 14600kf and like £320 for the 14700k.  Pins wise, yes I've done alot of very panicked research into the old vs new connectors, the melting and such. I was planning to upgrade my psu with the gpu (I currently have an 850w psu, I was going to get a corsair 850w at 3.1 for like £140) to get the at 3.1 ones with the native cable, and I was going to plug that thing in *very* firmly.

I think the Wraith Prism does the job but is just not the best, there are many better options for cheap.   I had my doubts with this cooler as it has very few reviews and is not a double tower.

I agree with the other reply, if you happen to get this AIO and the stock fans are too noisy for you, just swap them out with something from Arctic.  Also note, that the pump on the Frozen Notte is not PWM, so it runs at 100% at all times, but it's not noisy to me.",Neutral
Intel,"Also wanted to say that, if you want to customize your fan, download the program called FanControl and you should be able to lower the noise level.",Neutral
Intel,"My dual CCD 5800x (which runs about 5+C cooler than single CCD 5800x that have a fairly more warped IHS) wasn't kept in check by the wraith prism at all. Also the minimum RPM was like 1200 and it was loud as hell. While it's certainly the best stock cooler in recent production, it's completely useless against sub 50$ aftermarkets.",Negative
Intel,"I had money to spend so I got the new Corsair link and went ham on RGB. I spent some hours and had fun with different lights and themes.  It filled the itch and curiosity.  On spec, it seemed better than Arctic P12 (literally had P12 ARGB versions previously), but actual execution on cooling has been pretty disappointing. I had mines set to quiet, but course still hear pump noise.  If I ever do a next PC build, I prob go back to doing silent build again or a mini PC. Arctic P12 Pro is a much better design that addresses issues the original P12 had.  Though I am curious about Thermalright TL-12 performing better at lower RPM range than Arctic P12s.",Positive
Intel,"I have the Wraith Prism in one of my systems and I can barely hear the fan unless I really stress the CPU. I moved it into my HTPC to watch movies and play games and it is basically inaudible during quiet movie scenes.    It certainly would lose to any $50 aftermarkets. It would lose out to even a cheap $35-$40 Thermalright. However, it should still be perfectly sufficient to run a 105W cpu like a 2700X or 5800X.   The fact that his 5800X idles at 47'C suggests something is wrong with the cooler, TP, or the installation. A 5800X at idle consumes about the same power and gives off the same heat as the 5600X, 3600X, 5800X3D, 5700X3D, and 5700X. I've had almost every single one of these CPUs and my chips all ran in the high 20s 'C to low 30s 'C idle with ambient temps of around 21-25.5'C (70 to 78'F).",Negative
Intel,What issues did the original P12 have?,Neutral
Intel,"Or maybe it's the case (and it may explain the higher idle temp), there are a few revisions of the prism that had a lower RPM minimum threshold, mine was stuck at an obnoxiously high minimum RPM that made it loud and clear. In fact a few days later the Be Quiet DRP4 finally came and I got rid of the prism, but I'm quite picky with fan noise",Neutral
Intel,"I used P12 in various build for years. It's my go to.  The only problem is bearing noise after a year, even after cleaning.  My last build was strictly be quiet case fans mad had been quiet since then.",Neutral
Intel,Even after they switched to FDB? My P12s have been whisper quiet for a couple years now.,Negative
Intel,"I think your whisper quiet is my ""noisey"" lol.  When I had the P12 ARGB, that one is based on P12 Pro, did not exhibit noise.   Before my full $$$$ Corsair RGB build, I always had what I call ""dead silent"" builds. Like the computer would be 2nd or 3rd noisiest thing in the room even while gaming. Not the fast CPU and GPU, but can still have a high performance.  My haswell build 10 years ago had a large CPU heatsink no fan.  The original P12 has always had a balance issue when standing vertical position. If ran for 4 hours a day daily, after a year, I can hear the noise would increase and be a really faint bearing noise.  This is NOT an issue with P12 ARGB and P12 Pro as they have a revised fan design and I would totally recommend them over the original P12.   As for me thinking about Thermalright and Be Quiet, that is mainly to get the most amount of airflow with least amount of sound possible. I have seen YouTube videos of guys testing these at 800rpm and 1000rpm tests and Arctic is usually behind those fans (not a large margin, but still great on price per performance).",Neutral
Intel,Are you sure those issues persisted after they switched to FDB though? I know there was an annoying high pitched noise on their DBB fans.,Negative
Intel,"You can always get a 5070ti and increase the resolution. A better AM4 x3dCPU will be very hard to find for a proper price at the moment.   If you don't plan to play on 1440p, you're fine with your current setup.",Neutral
Intel,I have a 5600x and a 5070 and in 1440p it pairs very well. Im not 100% sure how well a 5600x would hold a 5070Ti but it should work good as well.  If you do upgrade to a 5070/5070Ti I would exclusively play in 1440p  The CPU usage in arc raiders is normal for our generation of CPU. Yes its bottlenecking but since your GPU is still high (80-95%) its not a hard bottleneck.   Also the difference from a 5600x to a 5800XT is like a 2% difference I would not waste money on a new CPU unless you can find a AM4 X3D for CHEAP.   Id do a 5070 and run it for a few years. Im very happy with how I perform in games.,Positive
Intel,I’ve been playing on 1440p most games except cs2 which I run on 1080p.,Neutral
Intel,I was actually meaning the ryzen 7 5800x3d. Seems like that would be around a 10% ish maybe more improvement over the 5600x. I like your suggestion. Thank you.,Positive

Intel,Yup. Also does media processing very very good.,Positive
Intel,Personally I'd take the 1st one. Performance between the 8700f and 14400f is pretty much the same for games and I'd rather have a cut down 7700xt than a 5060 as it should pull comfortably ahead in most titles and the extra vram is cool. It's in a better position to upgrade once prices stop being fucky as well,Positive
Intel,the B580 oneo,Neutral
Intel,"Usually if the 1st attribute in the list is **windows** , it's a really bad omen to me. 1st it should never be in priority spot, 2nd I suspect they charge extra 50-100$ included in the price for the clean windows (they used 5$ OEM key) and I could purchase the PC laptop way cheaper without the windows,",Negative

Intel,Imagine not even making minimum requirement list,Negative
Intel,"Im not saying this is good, just stating the potential reasons. The game uses UE5, which is already heavy out the gate, and those minimum specs line up with the PS5 and XSX.   So, given that the XSS is a thing lower than minimum, it will be viable for 30 fps at 1080p. I'd imagine.   Either the consoles are 1080p@60, and they're just using that as PC min spec, or they just chucked the equivalents as min spec even if they aren't the minimum to run it.",Neutral

The recommended specs are slightly more generous than the last Lego Batman game: recommended was 4 to 5-year-old GPU's (GTX 480 and Radeon 5850), while the 3080 is nearly 6 years old.   You being uncomfortable with the passage of time has nothing to do with optimization. It's been more than a decade since the last game. Graphics improve. Not just the actual effects, but also the amount of stuff that can be rendered at once in a map.",Neutral
Intel,another unoptimized slop,Negative
Intel,"I have the explanation.  You know how everyone was begging for a return of AA games, right? Everyone was fed up of only AAAs with inflated budgets and indies? People wanted mid-budget ""AA"" games more often?   That's where Unreal Engine 5 comes in. The Monkey's Paw curls a finger.   It allows teams to make games much more quickly, and gives lower budget games the opportunity to have a much greater scope both in terms of graphics and content (e.g. Clair Obscur Expedition 33). Also just because it's Lego doesn't mean it's not going to look gorgeous. If this has Lumen, this is going to look better than Arkham Knight in terms of lighting.   But UE5 is notoriously tougher to run. That's why they don't want to underbelly how intensive the game is. Odds are, it should run fine on a lower end card. But they don't want to be complained at if it doesn't.",Neutral

This ment it needed an Radeon 8500 or GeForce 4 from late 2001/early 2002. Radeon 7000 and GeForce 3 GPUs from 2001 were already outdated.  Those GPUs released at $299 MSRP. Adjusted for inflation, that's almost $550 today. So depending on how you want to compare prices, that's roughly on par with requiring an RTX 4060 or RTX 4070 Super for a game released in 2025.

Intel,"dudes who be yappin about ""games aren't optimized anymore!"" don't know shit about ""unoptimized"" games. GPUs from 3+ years ago are still completely viable today but back then a GPU that's a year old would barely be able to play anything new",Negative
Intel,"I was running a Radeon 9700 when Oblivion dropped, bought it in late 2002. It was the king of the hill, I had it overclocked slightly over 9700 Pro spec.  Oblivion *killed it*. Even on ""Medium"". Even at 1024x768. FPS was below 20 at all times and dropped into single figures when refraction shaders were used.  That'd be like an AAA game today running badly on an RTX 4080 or 4090 from 2022.",Positive
Intel,Gpu improvements have heavily stagnated. The 3080 is still stronger than the 5060ti 16gb and even trails the 4070 from last gen.,Neutral
Intel,you couldnt play games maxed out on $500 graphics cards even in 2005 without framerate dips.  as for now. a $500 5060ti 16gb running dlss 4.5 at balanced 1440p looks good and hits 60+fps.,Neutral
Intel,"It's a LEGO game now set in a larger open world and the visuals absolutely look more detailed than the last Star Wars LEGO game, which was set in smaller linear environments. Open world games just take more to render then closed environments do.   Like, I dunno what else to tell you. The 3080 is almost six years old. It's aging and it's perfectly natural that older GPUs move down into the ""recommended"" spectrum.",Positive
Intel,Thank u i was panicking. Still not great,Negative
Intel,"tbh for real, a lego game shouldn't be demanding this much lol. ue5's wid for this",Negative
Intel,What would you say is closest to a 3080ti?,Neutral
Intel,The 4070 super is about the same,Neutral
Intel,"This isn't something subjective, it's verifiable. According to TPU, the 5060 Ti is only 11% slower while the 5070 is 15% faster.   The requirements talk about the 10gb variant so that's the one I'm considering.   Iceberg Tech also made a video comparing the 3080 12gb and the 5060 Ti and they seemed to be close, so the 10gb variant would be closer.   I'm sure there are more benchmarks you can lookup to verify the performance of the cards and reevaluate your understanding based on the results",Neutral
Intel,thought you were talkin about the Forza Horizon 4 expansion for a sec,Neutral
Intel,Playing Horizon with my son right now and it looks amazing.,Positive
Intel,"Me, personally, have a much better time with ue5 games than I did on the 4070.  Less stuttery",Positive
Intel,UE5 is bad on all cards,Negative
Intel,Arena Breakout Infinite is UE5. It runs in 3440x1440 at over 200fps on my 7900XTX. It's buttery smooth so to say.   UE5 runs fine on AMD cards.,Positive
Intel,"Seriously. When folks do these comparisons of older games vs. newer games, it's always games that at the time they released were technical achievements from some of the biggest studios pushing the boundaries of what was possible at the time.   That often had not only outsized budgets, but development timelines relative to what a smaller team can afford.  It's like uh, yeah, the game looks good because they put an immense amount of time and labor into bespoke assets and toolkits to achieve a specific aesthetic within the boundaries of that period's hardware. (and oftentimes not even within those boundaries, but pushing beyond them like Arkham Knight)",Neutral
Intel,I'm comparing it to that because at lowest settings it runs and looks worse than a game from 2014.,Negative
Intel,Truth. I had no issues when I had a GTX 1080 last year.,Positive
Intel,The fact you can play the majority of modern games on 10 year old hardware seems to say the opposite of the point you're making.,Negative
Intel,Yeah but you need RTX and more CUDA cores to get all the best AI copilot features,Neutral
Intel,Big part of it as well. Everything is UE5 slop nowadays.,Negative

Intel,"RT capable cards have existed for eight years, if your PC rig doesn't have one it might be time for an upgrade ngl",Neutral
Intel,the 9060xt is pretty similar speed as it lacks dlss and fsr3 looks bad (unless the game supports fsr4). 9070 or 5070 are upgrades though,Negative
Intel,"And before Steam and indie games really took off we had a period of publishers dismissing all PC gamers as pirates. That era was full of just *atrocious* ports from consoles, if the publishers even bothered at all.    It was pretty much just Valve and Blizzard holding the PC flag for a while, and Bioware was at least good about adapting their UIs for PC (tactical mode in DAO, for example).",Negative
Intel,"I had ME at the time, and after adding ram to my system, I was soft locking about every 30-45 min.",Neutral
Intel,"Not to mention that a lot of the stutters of the Oblivion remaster are not because of UE5, but because the original Oblivion code still stutters on hardware from over 15 years later.  Asset streaming in open worlds is a hard problem. We live in a blessed time to treat the occasional shader compilation stutter in UE5 games a as a major issue.",Negative
Intel,I had a vanilla GeForce 6800 which I was able to unmask some extra pixel pipelines for extra performance. Not sure if I ever played Oblivion on that though because I played it a couple years after release. I might've played it with my next build with the GeForce 9800 gt.,Neutral
Intel,It doesn’t matter how old the 3080 is. It’s not a weak gpu by any means. It’s like 10% stronger than the 5060ti 16gb and only slightly trails the 4070 for comparison.,Positive
Intel,Eh I blame developers just as much,Negative
Intel,"12gb 3080 and 3080ti are essentially the same performance, so the closest equivalent would be a base 4070 and 4070 super or 5070",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah there are a lot more advantages to the 3080(like its near 2x bus), and there are 2 variants of the 5060ti... don't know ""iceberg tech""... so wont speak to that.  When looking at either. We see that when in RT, the 3080 just smacks the crap out of the 5060ti 8Gb, and makes the 5060ti 16GB do a very good impression of the french. Only winning when it can leverage the 16GB Vram buffer, which is predominantly 4k, which is not a great res for that GPU anyway.",Neutral
Intel,"Tech power up isn’t accurate down to the perctanges like that, it’s more of a rough idea on where the perf of a card stacks up.   In real world benchmarks and game testing at 1440p/4K the 3080 is much closer to the 5070.   You even said that the 3080ti is closest to the 4070 super, which is correct. The 12gb 3080 is essentially the same thing as a 3080ti in perf, and a 4070 super is around 5070 perf too, so you basically agree with me already.",Neutral
Intel,haha. Lego Horizon Adventures to fully clarify!,Positive
Intel,"Probably able to just brute force it a bit more, I found I had a better time when I went with the x3d chip from my 12th gen i5. The stutters hit less frequently recovered much faster than the gpu upgrade",Positive
Intel,bad developers are bad on all cards* ftfy,Negative
Intel,I mean 7900 XTX is still tied for like 8th best amongst non-commercial cards.  Its kind of a beast.,Positive
Intel,"There are definitely examples of ue5 that run fine on amd cards, but there are a lot that don’t.",Neutral
Intel,Worse than a game at max settings? Well yeah. A game from 2014 at lowest also looked worse than a maxed out 2004 game. Maxed out 1440p half life 2 vs lowest settings 720p shadow of Mordor (which was considered a good looking game on release…not so much later). Half life 2 clears.  It’s been like that for a very long time. Basically ever since graphics settings.,Negative
Intel,I think we're saying the same thing? Only a small number of recent games require RT.,Neutral
Intel,"I tired RT only once on my 6800XT and that was Control. Never bothered again.   Also I play a lot on my Steamdeck a lot. Because I do not need glasses using that. Game streaming never worked for me.   I got two reasons not to get it. Both not very strong, but forced RT was an immediate turn-off so I immediately forgot about it. Maybe when it is dirt-cheap on GOG.",Negative
Intel,"And the physical hardware was so low quality.  GPU didn't even need a 12VHWPR connector to frequently fail within 2-3 years, because capacitors, coolers, PSUs, and the general build quality were so bad. [This thing was a $299 card in 2002](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce4-ti-4400.c180), and it's not like high-end cards were built much better. Even on a purely physical level, it's awesome how much better built a [modern equivalent like the 5060 is.](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-5060.c4219)  I lost 2 GPUs to those dreaded flickering polygons (afaik indicating that some memory cell or data channel had broken) just in the 3-4 or so years I was playing World of Warcraft.  Not to mention the buzzing audio because most cables and speakers broke easily. I had to weigh down the cable of my speakers to make up for a partial cable break constantly, and had buzzy sound every summer when temperatures went up.",Negative
Intel,Whoever said it's *weak*? It's now a mid-range GPU. It is *literally the recommended GPU* for this game.,Neutral
Intel,Thank you for the insight 🤝,Positive
Intel,Is HUB a big enough channel for ya? Their review puts the the 5060 Ti 11.5% behind the 3080 12gb at 1440p so within 10% of a 3080 10gb. I would not call that a smacking.   I'm not saying that the 5060 Ti is a good card or that the 3080 10gb is bad. All the comparisons I'm saying indicate that they're reasonably close to each other and that's about it,Neutral
Intel,"The post specifically mentions the 10gb variant of the 3080 though. HUB's 5060 Ti puts it 10% slower than a 4070/3080 12gb at 1440p as well, and the 10gb variant is a few percent slower. Am I missing something?  https://preview.redd.it/pvqh1o7aoleg1.png?width=1763&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed5bda7f6f8891119c5126bc371b1930bca8bf04",Neutral
Intel,"Makes sense, I have a fairly mid range CPU, maybe I'll upgrade it, but to be honest, I don't want to till the next generation of CPUs hit",Neutral
Intel,"Oh yeh it usually runs bad, but this is Id's engine which runs amazing on amd cards generally. They did black magic to get it running smoothly. Obviously I couldn't use the path tracing mode but who cares.",Positive
Intel,"That's funny, because of course both Indiana Jones and Doom TDA at max settings run *much* better on your GPU than Control does. Because they have 'forced RT' so the games are actually built to *properly utilize* it, unlike Control which has the nice non-forced RT everyone loves - because it's bolted onto the existing engine and runs like crap. Just like *every* game that has RT bolted on runs like crap when it's enabled.",Positive
Intel,"I had one of the earlier fan cooled GPUs, and it had the bearing in the fan fail. It rattled for a bit, then the card died.   I remember all the issues with audio drivers, and it being generally recommended to have a separate sound card to get better stability for games",Negative
Intel,What I meant was the guy I was replying to says it’s perfectly natural for a 6 year old gpu to be seen in the recommended. Kinda insinuating that the 3080 is an older less powerful card that should be relegated to this status. Despite it being stronger than the less than a year old 5060ti,Neutral
Intel,"Again, what 5060ti...  You used a source. I used the exact same source. When you actually dive into the specific results, the ""12%"" average. Turns out its a lot more than 12% but occasionally the 3080 didn't run a vram parasite. You just have to open up the techpowerup results to see the details.",Neutral
Intel,Where my bro the 3070 ti? He falls right above the 7700 XT in 1080p.,Neutral
Intel,9800s only recently came out and honestly even the 5800x3d is still a premium chip. You wouldn’t be putting yourself in a bad position if you grabbed any x3d chip,Neutral
Intel,"Sure, but also it *is* an older less powerful card. It's simply relegated from a flagship status to midrange - while 5060Ti although more recent was of course midrange to begin with.",Neutral
Intel,You can't just grab a CPU and call it a day. Moving from LGA 1700 to AM4 would be monumentally stupid. He can already upgrade to CPUs equal to the 5800X3D on the existing platform.,Negative
Intel,"Of course he can, I was just on the same train of thought of I upgraded to an x3d chip.",Neutral
Intel,You upgraded to AM5 which makes sense. The 5800X3D isn't an upgrade over the best Intel CPUs.,Neutral

Intel,Do ARC GPUs work well on Linux? I didn't know.,Neutral
Intel,"More VRAM than you need is better than running out of VRAM. The GPU itself is somewhere in the neighborhood of 4060/4060Ti territory, so it's certainly capable of outrunning 8GB, which would result in a horrible, stuttery mess",Positive
Intel,Feel like it's probably the best option at that price if you're scared of used GPUs at least (not that there much competition),Positive
Intel,The opposite of everything you just said is true. Drivers are stable now. It saturates 12 GB of VRAM if playing at higher resolutions. And it actually is not great for Linux if you intend to game.

It is generally better now than before, but getting Nvidia drivers is still a pain in the ass if you want legacy drivers.   Arc and Radeon run great on Linux but game compatability is still not perfect. But that is not a driver issue but a game issue.

Intel,"I play vanilla and don't play with mods lmao. I have some DLC's that's all.  I have 32GB 6400MT/s RAM, when playing I noticed I was using around 12gb of RAM. Windows idling uses around 8gb.",Neutral
Intel,Since i play on 1080p and i don t have access to dlss i don t use any kind of upscaling but i have to say that for anti aliasing xess is far better than fsr and especially tsr,Positive
Intel,"You want it to max the 12GB? I can't just tell it to do that, I need to load enough stuff in the game so it maxes the VRAM.  I don't understand your logic. VRAM is like RAM, more chrome tabs, more RAM. So more of the map being rendered/more stuff in the game, more VRAM. Where did you hear otherwise?",Negative
Intel,"Most graphics cards go from 8 GB of VRAM to 12 GB, with very few offering an intermediate amount. If he is using 9.7 GB, that means that an 8 GB card would be too little, making the upgrade to 12 GB necessary.",Neutral
Intel,"Cause I didn't load enough game at once. Holy shit it's like saying ""ah your pc is too weak and cannot use all 64 gigs at once"" while you just started windows. Like ofc you didn't open anything that will take up RAM. If I loaded up a city with 100 000 population I might max the VRAM because I am loading even more things up. Omg this has to be ragebait",Negative
Intel,Yeah but they still used more than 8gbs of vram which is most likely how much would have been put in the card if not 12gbs,Neutral
Intel,No. Read my other comments I'm not saying this for  a 82736th time.,Negative
Intel,"Well, and also the mobile Intel parts aren’t great for Linux performance from what I’ve heard. Certainly not particularly relevant to this discussion but just good to know.",Negative

Intel,"Yeah but they're irrelevant, haven't seen many gpus like the 4070 or something anyways because they are a generation older and weren't very transcendental",Negative
Intel,"I mean, you're not entirely wrong. We researchers have been working in the field for quite a long time. I've been doing machine learning since mid 2010s. I still remember trying to run early artificial neural networks on a GTX 960 4GB edition. For better and worse, we developed the mathematics and the software frameworks for this.  The use of GPUs in high performance computation is much older than most PC users/gamers realise",Neutral

Intel,"Don't sleep on xess 2, as I said it's been very good in terms of quality for me  I guess at 1080 you don't need it, but if some game can't write reach 60 or whatever your target is, definitely try it on ultra quality",Positive

Intel,"Ok but your comment is still missing the point. Say someone said ""this car can't go faster than 120km/hr"" your reply is basically ""wdym it can't go over 120km/hr? I literally drive mine on the autobahn. I get 100km/hr"". See the issue?",Negative
Intel,"Well that is mostly because their are mobile parts, so it will always be unfair to compare them to desktop parts.",Negative
Intel,"That's was I was saying, the availability is bad. It was bad even at launch",Negative
Intel,"Wasn't the GeForce 8000 series the first to come out with CUDA support?  At least as far as gaming cards, I'm not real familiar with Quadro stuff.  I had an 8800GT back in '07 and I remember talk about how GPUs would one day be useful for so much more than just gaming.",Neutral

Intel,"Honestly, my mind went Computer Science, then Counter Strike, then I re-added the context of the previous comments and got it.",Neutral
Intel,Ok I'll give it a look thanks!,Positive
Intel,"I'm getting ragebaited rn 😭  VRAM works just like RAM.  If you have a computer that has 32 gigs of RAM, maybe you need to open 1000 chrome tabs to use all 32 gigs of RAM.  If I have a game where more population of the city means more things to be loaded. It means that more population eats up more VRAM. I had a city with 60K pop, means it eats up 9.7gigs of VRAM when I am loading up that size city. If the city was let's say 100K, it's gonna be bigger which means more things to load which means more VRAM used which means potentially maxxing out the VRAM of my GPU.  Also if you didn't know this, maxxing out the VRAM of a GPU is not preferable as it brings stutters. That's why 8gigs of VRAM is not seen as enough these days. Because if I played my game on a 5050, it would start stuttering because I am maxxing the VRAM on that GPU.  Sigh",Negative
Intel,"Bait or mental retardation, call it",Negative
Intel,But he didn’t say it utilizes 12 GB of VRAM.,Neutral
Intel,"Sure but they don't sell 9.7gb cards, as far as I know it currently goes 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 3.5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 32, 48.",Neutral
Intel,"The game uses 9.7 GB which is more than 8 GB, am I correct? How many graphics cards with 9.7 GB of VRAM do you know,? Asking that, because 9 GB in this case is too little and 10 GB would be underutilized according to your impeccable logic🤣",Neutral
Intel,"Dont overthink it, its just classic internet people confidently asserting stuff they have no understanding of",Negative
Intel,"Not necessarily. While it's not common, there are games and settings that will appreciate the additional 2 GB of VRAM the B580 offers, and the B580 will have enough power play at these settings at 60+ FPS.  TLOU2 at 1080p Very High is an example of this. It needs [at least 11 to run smoothly](https://youtu.be/1miEsftnFI4?t=447) (the 1080 Ti has stable but slow frametimes), and the B580 can get an [average of 80 FPS natively.](https://youtu.be/lLe5AP6igjw?t=611)",Positive
Intel,Out of all the comments you chose that one?? I understand that the GPU has to be strong because I can't be just using 12gb VRAM at 5fps. But guess what? I use 10gb VRAM at 30fps and I have some breathing room of 2gb because if you didn't know if you max out the VRAM in a GPU then your game starts stuttering. Like bro the b580 has a great amount of vram. The RTX 5060 is stronger but it would perform worse in my game since it only has 8 GB so idk what your end goal is here. To prove that the b580 only needs 8?,Negative
Intel,"Well, yes, but comparatively to other mobile parts like Z2 extreme chips they have performance issues on Linux.  That’s kind of unfortunate I think because Intel makes some really killer mobile chips that I would love to use but I don’t want to use Windows on these mobile devices preferably.",Negative
Intel,"Still who would buy them? I prefer the 9060xt for just a bit more to get something far better, I just don't see the appeal",Negative
Intel,"I'm not sure which one is the first one to come out with CUDA support, but the GTX580 was the first one people actually managed to run deep learning models on successfully  It's worth bearing in mind that pre 2012, the mathematics, datasets and architectures of neural networks hadn't really developed enough to take full advantage of GPUs  The software frameworks were also very limited back then. It's not just CUDA you need. It's a bunch of CUDA accelerated frameworks like CuBLAS, CuRand. CuDNN etc.  Nvidia has put a lot of work into developing all of those frameworks over the last decade and a half",Neutral
Intel,"I guess it even longer. It's actually ""XFX SPEEDSTER SWFT 210 AMD Radeon RX 7600 Core Edition"" Holy shit",Positive
Intel,"The point is that the actual speed of a B580 is more likely to be the bottleneck than its amount of VRAM.   Let say I have a big car. The car's trunk has room for 1000 bricks but the car's engine can only do 100 HP. The car can indeed carry 1000 bricks at once but it won't be able to drive very fast with 1000 bricks in the trunk. If you are very patient in trafic you could tolerate driving with all 1000 bricks at once, but most of us would rather carry fewer bricks and drive faster.  That it the same situation as with the B580 (but depends on the game). You could have a very large world with many building and people all loaded at once, but the GPU is not fast enough to also get you above 60 FPS.  If you can tolerate driving a big car very slowly, then good for you. Patience is a virtue after all.",Neutral
Intel,"The original comment says that the card has issues with utilizing the full 12 GB of VRAM, then this guy commented on it saying ""what do you mean it's not fast enough to use the 12 GB of VRAM?"" Then proceeded to provide an example if it only using 9.7 GB of VRAM... He could have easily provided an example of another game that uses the full 12 GB of VRAM.... Instead he provided an example of it using 9.7gb VRAM. Maybe I'm confused but it sounded like he was trying to provide an example to counter the original claim of it not using the full 12 GB of VRAM. Which he should have provided an example that used closer to the full 12 GB of VRAM, he could have used a different game that was more graphically intense to do so",Negative
Intel,"holy moly its like 9.7 is the theoretical limit the game can use. No, it will use more the more I play. Thats why having 12GB is great cause you have a bit of breathing rooom.",Positive
Intel,"One skill I'm really proud of in myself is my IRL ability to admit when I don't know something. Although I rarely actually say that on the Internet, because if I don't know something, I just don't leave a comment.",Positive
Intel,"My point is you made a dumb comment. I would say 10gb would probably be best to make it a bit cheaper, since 95% of people getting such a budget card are not running 4k games that will utilise 12gb. also  >Out of all the comments you chose that one??  yeah. I chose that one, because it was the first one you made in the chain, and the one I first specifically replied to. Am I supposed to dig up random ones instead?",Negative
Intel,"I wanted an A310 for an old PC that I have, way better than a Radeon RX 550. Sadly, that won't happen",Negative
Intel,"wowie this is the second car analogy. But actually damn your analogy is so much better than the last guy's. Yes this makes a lot of sense I understand!!! And yes I can tolerate driving a big car slowly, just like how I said, 20-60 FPS while using 9.7GB in 4K which is still impressive imo. But if it was a 5050 and I maxxed the VRAM, then my game would have bad 1% lows and start stuttering a lot, forcing me to turn down the graphics or resolution. So I think 12GB VRAM is perfect for the B580, 8GB is too little in my opinion. As well because I do use more than 8GB.",Positive
Intel,mmmm maybe the secret is using premium instead of regular maybe thatll make my VRAM go up! :D,Positive
Intel,“Maybe I’m confused”  Yes.,Neutral
Intel,"I was just playing into their comment, obviously having a buffer is nice but even if 9.7gb was the maximum the game could use, there isn't a card that exists with that configuration it's either 8gb or 12gb",Neutral
Intel,"Ok and if I played my game for a bit longer than I would use even more than 9.7gb and my game will stutter if I had 10gb VRAM. But what's nice is the B580 has 12GB and I still have a decent amount of breathing headroom. Btw cities Skylines came out in 2015, what if I want to play an even more modern and unoptimized game? That 12gb VRAM is amazing for that situation. I really don't understand what you want, I personally bought mine for 300 euros and you can't get 12gb VRAM anywhere else for that price. Also outside of gaming, productivity work eats up a lot of VRAM and this makes the b580 a good option for people who build a pc for work.",Neutral
Intel,Maybe look for something similar that's used (with some luck) idk what else you could do on that situation,Neutral
Intel,Like I said maybe I'm confused,Neutral
Intel,My main point here is that your original comment was poorly worded and pretty dumb.,Negative
Intel,"Is a PC that has ocasional use, not the main. I wanted it low power too to not have to change the PSU, the Arc A310 was perfect for it.",Positive
Intel,You can look up compatibility on the PC builder site.   I got a Z790 for 125$   I got the I5-14600Kf for 150$   It holds up really nice.  BE REALLY CAREFUL the Intel GPUs need REBAR so keep your eyes peeled for that.,Positive
Intel,"Must be nice to have a MC, my closest is a few thousand miles away.",Positive
Intel,intel 13th and 14th gen have cpu failures so only buy if you are willing to risk that,Negative
Intel,Totally forgot about the rebar. Thanks for the reminder. My current cpu and mobo support rebar and I have it activated. Definitely something I’ll have to consider when I upgrade to ddr5,Positive
Intel,Would 12600kf for 100 be good?,Neutral
Intel,A few thousand miles? Sorry that sucks. Their bundles/combos on parts are better than sex sometimes.,Negative
Intel,I mean.. CPUs are pretty far ahead of GPUs at least in terms of gaming.   Unless you planned on running 1440 with everything on ultra the B580 is great on most games. You’ll never feel like you are forced to run a game on low graphics.,Positive
Intel,If you plan on investing in Intel GPUs I would press you to get the newest gen.   Intel ARC B580 which is an entry Intel GPU didn’t play nice with older Intel Chips   12600 would hold up just fine.,Positive
Intel,Thanks there’s also the brand new core ultra 5 225f with bf6 for 150 on amazon. Would ultra core be a better fit?,Positive
Intel,If you don’t plan on upgrading it’s fine but if Intel releases a newer card that more powerful it might get bottlenecked.,Neutral
Intel,Dang maybe am5 cpu is better,Positive
Intel,I’d say to go AMD.   Intel royally fucked up in that race but since they did have a major price drop because of it I scooped one up cheap.,Negative
Intel,It doesn’t look built. It’s still in boxes,Negative
Intel,"Better to use two ram sticks, for dual channel, supposed to be faster. But should work fine like this too.",Positive
Intel,"This is blue! Proud to see how far you've come in the pc world Quick question, I thought you were going with the 6600",Positive
Intel,"Oh, these are just my parts, I did not put a pic of it being built, sorry",Neutral
Intel,I wouldn't be surprised if people start doing this for the shortage lmao,Neutral
Intel,"Micro Center bundle, only 1 stick... I asked for 2 8s but they said it would ruin the deal...",Negative
Intel,"Then, I found the Arc B570 for cheaper + its a newer and faster GPU",Positive
Intel,"Intel doesn't have the most stable drivers compared to the AMD and Nvidia, and their dx12 support for flight sims might actually make it worse than the 6600",Negative
Intel,"Intel Arc drivers + CS is a rough combo. Arc has gotten better, but esports titles are still hit or miss. FPS swings are kinda expected",Negative
Intel,"Monitor?  A bog standard (cheap) 1080p monitor may not go over 60 hz,",Neutral
Intel,yeah might as well sell the whole pc and try to build a different one idk if the cpus bottlenecking or if its the gpu,Negative
Intel,i think he has a 180hz acer monitor,Neutral
Intel,That's about what you can expect in that game,Neutral
Intel,"you are playing at fhd on a 4k gpu, up the resolution and shift more of the work onto the gpu, not the cpu. at fhd its ur cpu doing most of the work. you need to match ur monitor to ur rig.",Neutral
Intel,Playing at 1080p with a 5080 is kinda strange. You're gonna be CPU bottlenecked and only using 2/3 of your GPU. Would be better off with 5070 and beefier CPU at that resolution.,Negative
Intel,"In warzone that’s just your cpu limit. Don’t know about arc raiders but 200fps sounds realistic on a 14700k. The NVIDIA drivers and DLSS overhead is a real issue in cpu limited scenarios and games, often resulting in a 5-10% additional performance hit compared to similar performaning amd cards. (One of the reasons why a 9070xt matches a 5080 in battlefield 6 when tested correctly)   You likely can’t do much besides increasing visual settings. This won’t make your fps go higher but at 1080p you’ll be cpu bound anyways so you can at least enjoy better visuals xD   Or get a 9800x3d for a nice 30-40% gaming performance improvement",Negative
Intel,What resolution are you playing at?,Neutral
Intel,Play on 1440p instead of 1080p.  That processor is not for 1080p gaming.,Negative
Intel,Why do you use dlss performance on a fullhd? Just render game in native...,Negative
Intel,if you cant hold 200 set it to 180 capped or 165 set monitor hz rate to 165 sweet spot is 165,Neutral
Intel,i have drops down to 200 on rebirth with a tuned 14700k and a 5090 since the last update lmao. same fps on 2k and 4k.,Neutral
Intel,I get 100 fps on a 5600x 7700 xt....,Neutral
Intel,Yes BIOs is to newest available Fw.,Neutral
Intel,You need an X3D CPU if you want 200+ fps in 1080p. Your CPU is more suited for singleplayer games with RT at high resolutions.  Intel CPUs are garbage for competitive games.,Negative
Intel,If you want more go x3d,Positive
Intel,FULL HD,Neutral
Intel,"That's not how it works. Increasing resolution doesn't inherently take load off the CPU. What actually reduces CPU load is lowering the number of frames the system is trying to produce. When you raise the resolution and the GPU can't render as many frames, CPU load will drop as a side effect, but that's due to the reduced framerate, not the resolution increase itself.  If you cap the FPS to, say, 60 at both 1080p and 4K (assuming the GPU can handle both), the CPU workload will be the same. The CPU's job is tied to how many frames it has to prepare, not the resolution those frames are rendered at. When you're CPU limited, it means the processor is already producing as many frames as it can. Raising the resolution won't magically allow it to produce more frames, it just risks shifting you into a GPU bottleneck instead. That can make utilisation graphs look ""healthier"", but it's impossible for it to increase FPS, since you were already at the limit.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah that looks about right, at least for arc raiders that's right where it should be with dlss, sitting a bit below 200",Neutral
Intel,"Do you need performance out of the card, or is it literally there just for driving monitors? Afaik Kdenlive is not GPU accelerated except during rendering, and Minecraft definitely isn't graphics heavy unless the mods you're talking about are heavy shaders. You could probably use an A380 just as well, or any other low end video card for that matter.",Neutral
Intel,"75% of it's reason for being there is for driving monitors, yeah. Kdenlive uses it for rendering yeah. Shaders aren't super heavy, but my monitor is 4K so it has to push a high resolution.",Neutral
Intel,"I'm guessing pretty much any modern video card would do the job for you. Although Arc is nice because you can get one for pretty cheap, and it supports quick sync and hardware accelerated AV1 encode/decode. I definitely wouldn't get an A770 16 over an A750 unless you know you need the VRAM for whatever reason. Also consider an A380 or A580 if you think they're fast enough and you can get a good enough price reduction. I don't really know how fast the card has to be to run your modded minecraft acceptably at 4K, but I imagine it's not too demanding.",Positive
Intel,Understood! I'll keep an eye out for those too but I'm thinking the 750 is going to be the best bang for my buck.,Positive

Two of us liked it and kept it, I already have 100+ hours in it. I wouldn’t have given it a chance if it was for $70. I think early publicity does wonders to bring a lot of players who become curious because of all the talk around the game and just want to check what all the fuss is about, 40-50$ price works as a catalyst in it.",Positive

Intel,"i mean, it's not as bad as after they did half life episode 2. Valve did start making games again like Deadlock, and half life alyx. Also you would be unwise to think they are complacent.  They've been at the front of technological inovations and leaps, specially making ground breaking hardware and software acessible. The list is big from 2012 to 2025:  * Steam deck * Proton with linux, jailbreaking the need to depend on windows OS * VR Software, and VR compatibility * Steam API allowing us to play any game with any controller ever, freeing us from hunting shaddy drivers in a plug & play way. * Massive Overhaul to the steam store * Steam Remote play together (even if its just a worse ParSec) * Family Sharing (even if Xbox started it first) * Steam Overlay Overhaul (notes,timers,etc). * Valve is working on FEX-EMU(just like proton, but the ability to make your games coded at x86 language to ARM, meaning eventually you will be able to play steam games on your phone natively) * Their upcoming hardware (Steam machine, Steam Controller 2, and Steam Frame)  i could go on, but i understand your frustration if you are a Valve fan for their games.  Dont get me wrong though, valve is not perfect, they literally pionieered lootboxes with tf2 man. co and they do make a buck out of gambling. but the Pros heavily outweigh the cons.  edit;Typos",Neutral

Intel,"ARC Raiders is one of the best games I‘ve ever played. I‘m not surprised it‘s that successful.   Actually incredibly funny how far opinions on a game can differ.

The main problem with the games that are costing more though is that most of those games are unoptimized unimaginative AAAA games who have no valid reason to ask that mucj.,Negative
Intel,"Patience, time,  a few years, bargain basement price in the sales",Neutral
Intel,"Tbh I don't agree. Most indie games cost 20$ or less and only the big studio AAA games go over 60$.   And as much as we like to shit on newer games, if you skip the obviously bad launches, you are getting incredible value for that money.  And that's if you buy them right from the start. If you wait a few months, on PC games will be discounted by at least 25% after no more than a year.  I don't think I've ever spent more than 30$ on a game by simply not feeling the pressure to buy in immediately.  And even if you do pay the pricetag. Usually those games will have enough content to easily justify their cost. Overall gaming has one of the best value per dollar spent of any entertainment industry.",Neutral

It doesn’t happen all the time but when it does it’s quite hilarious. Not sure how this affects your ability to have “fun”.   The “PvE enemies” are absolutely far from boring. They kill people all the time and are very satisfying to take down. You wanna talk about boring PvE enemies. Look at Tarkov. Absolutely soulless brain dead enemies you have to fight in that game.   The massive zones that you fight in are also far from boring. My man what in the world are you on? I’d like to know what games you play that you think are fun. Arc Raiders is so freaking immersive it’s insane.",Negative
Intel,I don't have any of this on my lobbies.  Maybe you cry a lot too and matchmaking put you with others?,Negative
Intel,it’s “baby’s first extraction shooter.”   i don’t play them anymore but it cannot come anywhere close to matching the intensity of tarkov or hunt: showdown.  i can see why it appeals to ppl new to the genre. it’s very polished and the community is cooperative not competitive.,Positive

Meanwhile if it is 30 to 50 euro's I am way more likely to take the leap so to say.

Intel,"People massively overestimated the popularity of extraction shooters. Rn only Arc made it to the top 10 Steam games and is the friendliest, most approachable of the bunch. Tarkov is the original, most recognizable modern extraction shooter and just like all the others free or paid entry it stays within it's own niche group (and I have doubts that ppl here can name more than 3 extraction shooters outside of Arc that are currently playable)  This statement has the same energy as saying that Devil May Cry would be more exciting if there weren't so many character action combo games already",Positive
Intel,You realize arc raiders is completely different from the one? EFT? I don’t know of any others I never played an extraction shooter until Arc but it’s not even remotely close to being the same.,Negative
Intel,The threat of losing loot seemed pretty low if you don't engage other players. It took out a lot of the tension in the game. A looter shooter is partially good because of the tension it has.,Negative
Intel,"Tension. Trying to extract with your buddy when you have good loot on you is pretty fun.   The game also feels in a good place where its not a deathmatch, but a lot of players are ratty so there is always fear.",Positive
Intel,That’s a very minor aspect of the game. Watch some people play and look for yourself. Go out and explore. Fight the arc. Talk to other people. Do quests. A lot to do in the game.,Neutral
Intel,The Destiny DLC was greedy. Hard to argue.,Negative
Intel,I can't like Bungie? Halo was great. Destiny started off good. I don't love destiny but the movement and aiming mechanics and much of the overall play of their games has always felt good to me. Hate on it if you want.,Positive
Intel,"Depends on the type of criticism, and how you phrase it.   Just that there's a huge gap between ""this game did this stuff poorly"" and shit like ""hurr durr game is boring trash I'm right if you disagree ur a crybaby toxic fanboy"".   Haven't played Arc Raiders, rarely even a fan of this type of games, but when someone makes obnoxious takes like latter, it's really hard to defend them for seeing the bad side of a fanbase.    Also those egging on or glorifying these type of takes with upvotes are just as immature as the fanbase in question",Negative
Intel,Bro I was literally saying that I respect your opinion lol,Neutral
Intel,"I mean, some people just don’t really like the extraction shooter gameplay loop?   I personally find it a boring game too but I can see the hype and reason why people like it but I’m more of a “steady progression” type of person.   The games that I’ve been liking are Where Winds Meet, Expedition 33, bunch of random single player JRPGs that have come out in the past few years, BG3, sometimes I’ll revisit little maplestory private servers etc.   The gameplay loop of extraction shooters just doesn’t appeal to the type of gamer I am.  Edit: also I understand there is progression in Arc Raiders it’s just not the style of progression I enjoy.",Negative
Intel,I think ARC raiders is a good game and it’s quite enjoyable with friends but to call it the best game of the last 10 years is insane. Maybe if you only play multiplayer shooter games.,Positive
Intel,"Not the person you're replying to; but it's all just simply a matter of personal opinion/taste in games.  Like.. I freaking dislike Skyrim massively. I've given it so many chances (probably started from scratch at least 5 times - and put in 38 hours according to Steam), but it just absolutely fucking sucks *in my opinion*.   I'm really into RPGs - fucking love the genre - loved the previous Elder Scroll titles (Morrowind especially), but Skyrim just doesn't do anything for me. The story is atrocious (in my opinion), but the world they built is top-notch though - my longest session was just running around, exploring, completely avoiding the story.  It's perfectly fine to dislike or find something boring, that thousands/millions of people really like. Nothing wrong with that.   Doesn't need to be justified either.  ....but there wasn't a need to start stirring shit up, by calling others ""cry babies"" to begin with.

Intel,"I mean you’re free to refund the game if you don’t like it?   I’m just saying, calling games too expensive under a comment for ARC raiders, literally one of the cheapest AAA games in the market for what you get is a lil crazy  $100 for GTA6 is bullshit and scummy, $40 for a game you can get over 100hrs content out of isn’t",Negative

Intel,Is that why you edited your original comment after I replied to call anyone disagreeing a cry baby? Can't make this shit up.,Negative
Intel,"I do think there's a difference between saying something is not your taste and outright calling it boring and aimless. Like I probably never want to crochet in my life, but I can see why someone enjoys the act  But I feel like Arc Raiders has a pretty clear appeal.",Neutral

Intel,Instead of trying to mock me like a baby prove me wrong. You haven’t. You’re spewing garbage ass nonsense.,Negative
Intel,"Its not ""disrespecting your opinion"", they were addressing your criticism of the game.  You complain about the lack of players willing to do PvP, they informed you how the game has matchmaking to put aggressive players together. You want more aggressive players in ARC? Start attacking first.  Informing you how the game functions is anything but disrespecting you.",Negative
Intel,You’re joking right?,Neutral
Intel,"ya i agree. i can appreciate that it is getting people into the genre though, i still love the idea of extraction shooters.   check out witchfire. it’s like if hunt and doom had a PVE baby.",Positive
Intel,A price point isn't more noble just because you currently fit in it,Neutral
Intel,"They arent lying, theyre outright stating it. Which brings me back to the point about people being all preformative about Ai assets in games",Neutral
Intel,"Well yea, in its current state the game is not even released. But once it hits the shelves, it is obvious that it will be an esports game with microtransactions, or gambling, or both.  I can bet my soul on it.",Neutral
Intel,That's true. Though there were a bunch of announced extraction shooter games announced a few years back so that might have caused the impression,Neutral
Intel,I guess that's fair. Bungie certainly has made some not so good choices with Destiny. Sucks to see.,Negative
Intel,"That was an invitation for all the whiners to keep being pathetic. If you fall into that category, then it was for you. Game is boring. I stand by my opinion of a game I played. Like or don’t. GFY either way. Couldn’t care less.",Negative
Intel,How is it different from other person calling it best game in 10 years?,Neutral
Intel,That's perfectly fine - the person wasn't doing that though (at least at first - didn't dive deeper into the comments they made) - but seeing as the person was giving their opinion on the game and not a general opinion on it; it's perfectly find for them to call it boring in their opinion or whatever else they want.  A fair bit of people are seemingly dismissing that it's their opinion and not a general opinion that everyone then needs to agree with.  They weren't saying that it was a boring game - but that *they* found it boring.,Negative
Intel,I don’t have to defend MY opinion lol. Accept it and move tf on. Why are you here arguing with a random on Reddit instead of playing the game that is just the greatest?,Negative
Intel,I didn’t say anything in my first post other than I thought it was boring though. Then I was attacked because people can’t accept differing opinions. I don’t have to say why I don’t like it.,Negative
Intel,What?,Neutral
Intel,Having to put the game down after nearly 8 years of playing really hurt but its at the point of eating itself same as bungie,Negative
Intel,You clearly care enough to keep commenting,Neutral
Intel,you just roll your eyes at that. Same way people tell me breath of the wild is the best game ever.,Positive
Intel,You’re responding! 🤣 at least answer my questions if you’re gonna do so but all you’ve done is spew garbage the whole time. Yikes. My goodness.,Negative
Intel,"I'd upgrade the gpu. Maybe look for 3080 / 6800xt. Should give you a nice fps bump without being choked out too bad. The 7700k is as good as you can go on that motherboards, so if you want a cpu upgrade on the cheap I'd look for an am4 motherboard with a 3600x(cheap) or 5600x then you can keep the ram.",Positive
Intel,Budget/country?,Neutral
Intel,"The best upgrade for THIS PC would be a graphics card. If you set on Nvidia, get a used 3060Ti, not 8Gb. Or RX6700XT, used. It will give you some boost for now.",Positive
Intel,I plan on replacing the mobo. I play Tarkov some and people have raved about the 7800x3d and thought of moving to AMD. I also looked at a 3080 but some of the 5060 I’ve seen are close enough to warrant “future proofing” with a newer gpu.,Neutral
Intel,"U.S., don’t have a set budget overall. I would say $4-500 for a gpu that does what I need it to do. I can wait on ram to come back down to earth if that helps.",Neutral
Intel,I'll believe them (either Intel or AMD) when I see the benchmarks.  Until then this is all just pointless noise.,Neutral
Intel,well yeah you can't compare them because strix halo is on a signficantly larger die wheras panther lake is more comparable to something like the hx370.   If amd is able to get strix halo at a competitive price then sure it will compete but the issue is that with such a large die I don't think it is possible for them to compete in price with panther lake,Neutral
Intel,I’ll never understand why AMD is not committing to design RDNA4 based APUs and at this point I just take RDNA 3.5 as a joke because they can’t even support FSR4 on it officially nor the RX 7000 cards.  It’s like they are losing on purpose,Negative
Intel,"AMD has this “it’s good enough for a while and we’ll release something great that people will forget this happened”  Vega lasted in mobile for nearly 5 years and got RDNA2 designs. Now, it’s RDNA3.5 being built for mobile platform and betting on that to be good enough until RDNA5/UDNA bridge die designs releases (unverified rumor)  AMD also has this weird obsession with competitor naming. Sure, it’s meant to confuse buyers but it’s hurting them than helping, maybe it does help in terms of inventory.  They’re not intel-like of stagnation. They’re competing but not for us in the consumer market and we’re just getting scraps until enterprise trend die down (currently AI trend/bubble).  Well, it’s understandable as Zen designs are really focused in Epyc and scale down to Ryzen SKUs.  And the 400 series is a bad refresh when Ryzen 6000 mobile is the definitive refresh they have done, Zen 3+ and move to RDNA2. AMD could’ve done similar commitment but it’s not currently.  Also, AMD forgor Strix Halo laptops are still nowhere to be found aside from 1 or 2",Neutral

Intel,Idgaf when Strix Halo products are nowhere to be seen (notebooks),Negative
Intel,"Except that the B390 will be far more common as it will be seen in far more laptops. Yes, the 8060S & 8050s can be found in some laptops, but for the laptops you'll find in places like Currys, Best Buy or Mediamarkt, the B390 will be the most powerful iGPU you'll likely find & it'll happily outdo a Radeon 890M",Positive
Intel,"AMD is at the point where Intel was before they went down the route and are recovering, history repeats before it's too late.  Not going to believe either until we get actual benchmarks and results.",Negative
Intel,Meanwhile AMD keeps putting out new chips with years old GPUs.,Neutral
Intel,Core Ultra 2 is already a better mobile soc.  I don't know why AMD thinks 12-16 cores is more important than battery life when it comes to laptops.,Neutral
Intel,It does sound complacent but ultimately the proof is in the pudding.,Neutral
Intel,"If it is not even fair to compare (because Strix Halo is WAY more watts) then why is AMD comparing them? B390 will exist, Strix Halo virtually does not in laptops.",Negative
Intel,"AMD is playing the same intel book a few years ago. Except now instead of 14nm+++++++, it is RDNA 3.5555555.",Neutral
Intel,The Intel igpu has a better upscaler by far. FSR3.1 is a third class competitor in comparison. People have been crying out for AMD to release FSR4 for RDNA3.5 but AMD has some seriously stupid execs in charge.,Negative
Intel,Lot of markets and Intel did bribe the oems for decades and still do,Negative
Intel,Benchmarks first,Neutral
Intel,Beware hubris.,Negative
Intel,"There are already benchmarks, look them up.",Neutral
Intel,Don't they already have an integrated GPU that's on par with an RTX 4060? According to Framework?,Neutral
Intel,"strix halo is nice and all, but too prohibitively expensive to be considered for many people  arc b390/b370 will be available in much cheaper products for which amd doesn't have a proper answer to atm. amd's next lineup can't be lazy if they want to stay competitive",Negative
Intel,"The GPU doesn't matter if you don't have proper drivers and they are so far behind still Intel.   Great progress, but the drivers are still going to be the thing that makes people say no.   If intel keeps on chugging away and they work with all the DirectX games backwards and going forward.   I'm talking past DirectX games, you can't just worry about the new games there's games that are older that don't run well.   It took AMD many many years to get decent drivers, Intel I don't know if they're just focusing on hardware and not the drivers, but that so far is what's been holding it back.   Hopefully they can release a true dedicated GPU back in rival something that's out there at a much better price that will bring at least some competition back until the AI scam is over.",Negative
Intel,Panther Lake is using a superior process technology. So they are right. But it doesn't matter as customer will choose what's better. But until AMD has something out that uses 2nm then yes they will be behind probably,Neutral
Intel,I hope Intel stays competitive and AMD also brings its best to the table.,Positive
Intel,They should be worried about DLSS 4.5 though. Fix stuttering on FSR 4 and improve image quality,Neutral
Intel,I just wish Intel would make a very cut down panther lake offering to be the successor to the N1xx/N3xx line of efficient chips that have found their way into mini PCs.,Neutral
Intel,amd unfazed? I bet they are talking big shit again then will get absolutely demolished (as it happened with vega too),Negative
Intel,"Yeah it's old architechture, that's the point, Intel moved to the lastest node and barely manages to eek out a win. A win is a win nonetheless, but AMD still have plenty to dials to turn up.",Neutral
Intel,"I don't understand the fuss about iGPUs? Like why do they assume the average Joe would care about an IGPU at all? That's maybe 5% of the market and even then...most of them would get a dGPU anyways.  And apart from the GPU, what's special about the CPU? Combining (Lunar Lake) efficiency with (Arrow Lake) power? Sorry but my Ryzen AI 7 350 does that already. The top of the line x9 388h is about ~10% faster in single core aka the only thing that matters and will probably be in 2500€+ laptops whereas my 7 350 is in 500€ laptops.  I tried a 285h laptop besides the AI 7 350 and not only did it run hotter and less efficient, it also felt less snappier.    And the AI 7 350 was designed as a Lunar Lake competitor anyways so it was never worse in efficiency and ahead of Arrow Lakes like the 255h in that regard.  So I don't see why anything should really change...?",Negative
Intel,"AMD doesn't want to bring RDNA 4 to APUs, so as not to give FSR4 to users other than those with dedicated GPUs.",Neutral
Intel,a brand new product on a newer node is better than an older product on an older node?! who knew?,Positive
Intel,"And the price. I used to be an AMD fan, but as soon as competition with Intel was gone, AMD raised their prices and now act as if they believe they are a luxury brand. Hope Intel gets back into the game and if Intel can slash their prices it might end-up being the right choice.  At the same price, Intel is dead on arrival. At a serious discount they will take the place of AMD. No one is buying Strix Halo for handhelds, it is too expensive.",Neutral
Intel,Plenty of folks tested it at CES.  Intel was confident enough to let reporters run benchmarks and it's basically around 4050 level.  You should be able to run most games at 1080p at medium-high settings in an Ultrabook form factor.,Neutral
Intel,"Both are right/wrong.  Intel made their comparisons to Strix point because they’re in the same power class. Panther lake is much faster than Strix Point at the same power level (according to Intel, AMD doesn’t deny that) at 45W.  AMD says it doesn’t matter because their Strix halo (up to 120W) is faster which is pretty obvious.   It’s not technically lying, AMD is just referencing an entirely different class of product.",Neutral
Intel,"Well lunar lake is a monster and competes directly with the z2e both on performance and efficiency, so no reason to think panther lake will be worse.  Even if it falls short of Intels claims it will still be the leader until next year.",Neutral
Intel,The noise is doing a great job advertising for them. A war between them with fighting words will get them tons of free advertising.,Positive
Intel,And a much higher power budget.  AMD says they win because their 120W chip is faster than Intels 45W chip.   No surprise to anyone.,Positive
Intel,"I generally agree but i suspect that the 388h is using a much larger gpu than people suspect. I think its probably ~165mm2 in size, not 55mm2. i suspect the 55mm2 die varient is for the 4xe version, and the 12xe version is 3x that size.  I also dont understand why strix halo is so expensive. It would be interesting to see bom and packaging costs.",Neutral
Intel,"It sounds like RDNA4 just doesn't scale at all. All the rumors point to them going straight from RDNA3.5 to RDNA5 in APUs, just skipping RDNA4 all together.",Negative
Intel,RDNA 3.5 was the only reason I didn’t invest in a STRIX HALO mini PC. The price is too much for outdated unsupported tech.,Negative
Intel,"Might be the same reason they stuck with Vega for so long in APUs.  At the current available desktop memory (DDR4 at the time) an architecture change wouldn't have made a huge difference.    Once DDR5 came out for laptops, we finally saw RDNA 2+ APUs (Ryzen 6000 APUs).  I'd bet once DDR6 starts appearing on laptops we'll get a similar iGPU architecture leap.",Neutral
Intel,"AMD probably just didn't bother making a new APU design when they didn't have new CPU core to go with it. Medusa Halo is rumored for 2027 with Zen 6 and UDNA/RDNA5, so the Point version will likely release then too.",Neutral
Intel,AMD has and always will be their own worst enemy,Negative
Intel,"It's not like they aren't developing something this whole time, releases are planned many years in advanced. Intel will have some rope and then will get inevitably leap frogged",Neutral
Intel,It's not like Intel isn't doing the same. Panther Lake and ARC are holdovers of things developed under Gelsinger.,Neutral
Intel,"> AMD is going to f--- around and let Intel catch up, in CPUs and GPUs.  this is what we actually need: competition. AMD kicked intels butt, now intel is kicking back. it's a win for us either way.",Neutral
Intel,I hope Intel will catch up and encourage AMD to compete. Having cleat leader in CPUs or GPUs is bad for consumers.,Negative
Intel,"I mean, we know that AMD is innovating. They literally showed Zen 6 at CES. Its just not ready yet for mobile, and Intel caught up. Same thing happened with Alder Lake, where intel released that before Zen 4 was ready.",Neutral
Intel,"So AMD having much faster iGPUs for decade or more did not do much.  But now Intel rolling out something at unknown price/power package will absolutely decimate AMD.  Regardless of what will happen, ""AMD's fault"" indeed. (amazing silicon designers and experts at everything posting for free on reddit have convinced me)",Negative
Intel,"Laptops haven't really been AMD's focus, and apart from Zen1, AMD's focus has been mostly on data center, with desktop being the natural offshoot.",Neutral
Intel,Yeah they ain't immune to being complacent.  And bad press doesn't make Intel stay bad.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, their leaders aside from Ms. Su are all holdovers from AMD almost bankrupt times. Software sucks, graphics sucks, and now they are taking CPU down the drain too with high prices. Shitty leaders, lead to shitty outcomes.   They post high useless benchmark numbers no one cares about. They cannot compete with Apple in terms of battery life, and get creamed at low power levels.",Negative
Intel,"News at 10: ""Companies prioritise profits""",Neutral
Intel,"so either AMD doesn't have the capacity to produce them, or OEMs aren't interested, neither option is a compelling reason for AMD to focus on mobile",Negative
Intel,"We’d wish they were, but they’re not. Intel was struggling on all fronts due to their fabs. Amd is actually moving super fast in data centre so both epyc and instinct which is where they believe their money will be. They just don’t care to do anything in the consumer market.",Negative
Intel,"Halo is so much faster that the upscaler difference doesn't matter at all. Of course, it is probably also bigger.",Positive
Intel,"Yes, Strix Halo",Neutral
Intel,And having fsr4 supported in mobile at all,Neutral
Intel,FSR 4+ may be great but game support (number of titles + GPUs supported) is embarrassingly low,Negative
Intel,Dlss 4.5 not that great in my opinion. It fixes some ghosting but creates more shimmering because it has so much sharpening. I had to dial back to 4.0.,Negative
Intel,wildcat lake.  only issue it seems to be using 2 P cores and 4 LPE cores instead of E + LPE,Neutral
Intel,70% faster being “barely eke out a win”? Go ask why amd is stuck with 18 month old architecture despite intel managing to replace arrow lake after 12?,Negative
Intel,"You’ve got it backwards. The majority of laptops use IGPUs. IGPUs being as powerful as integrated graphics allows for cheaper thinner devices that are more power efficient. The entire intel CPU/IGPU performs on par with a 4050 at 60w at only 45w. When you factor in the 10-15w the CPU takes with the 4050 and you’re looking at similar performance at like half the power.   Being power efficient opens up a lot of form factors to be able to game with such as thin and light laptops, tablets, or gaming handhelds",Neutral
Intel,"> I used to be an AMD fan, but as soon as competition with Intel was gone, AMD raised their prices and now act as if they believe they are a luxury brand.   That's why it's silly to be a ""fan"" or ""supporter"" of one company or the other.  They don't care about you, they care about making money and when they have a dominant position they will exploit it.  > At the same price, Intel is dead on arrival. At a serious discount they will take the place of AMD. No one is buying Strix Halo for handhelds, it is too expensive.  Outside of that one device (Ayaneo maybe?), you're right.  But now AMD is also releasing an 8-core version of Strix Halo with the full 40 GPU CUs, which should be cheaper.  I expect that we'll see that in more handhelds at the high end.  Realistically speaking, it's easy to make the case that on a 7""-9"" screen the 40 CUs is way overkill.  There's still room for a middle ground that Intel could easily fill.",Negative
Intel,"Absolutely consumers win when competition is hot, AMD has a bit too much of a lead ATM so they are cashing in and getting lazy. That said I am glad they are having their day, only because a few years ago they were on the brink of bankruptcy and I really want to see them on a fairly level playing field with Intel... If we end up with 2 juggernauts training blows, having big resesrch budgets, etc we'll get lots of innovation and competitive pricing.",Neutral
Intel,"You had to shovel $1k for a 8 core CPU for about a decade, before AMD came.  So ""it just hiked the price"" is BS.  AMD cannot keep prices low while TSMC, effective monopolist, keeps posting record profits quarter after quarter.",Negative
Intel,AMD is basically just waiting for their chance to do the bad things. They are a corporation after all.,Negative
Intel,"Help us Cyrix, you are our only hope...",Positive
Intel,AMD has always been like this. The OG Athlon FX line from ~22 years ago were $1000 CPUs.,Neutral
Intel,Wasn't it equivalent more or less to the 4050m as it was power limited to 30 watts?,Neutral
Intel,"It's the price of the final product that will matter.  And given that Intel has lion's share of the mobile market, I don't see why the would not ask outrageous $$$ for it.  It is ""impressive"" only in the ""for iGPU"" context.   Based on the benches shown, laptops were consuming around 60W.  While AMD""s 370 HX has been shown to be able to game at below 20W, so uh.  Let's bait for wenchmarks in any case.",Neutral
Intel,"Sure, sure.  I'm going to wait for proper benchmarks done under lab conditions and documented by more than ""Intel let me run this game with the FPS counter on.""

Intel,"It was a Z1E competitor, but AMD gravely disappointed with the Z2E zero performance increase over Z1E and coming at a major price premium.",Negative
Intel,"Tbf, it's like dgpu winner is claimed by who has the strongest one, so in that way it's kinda fair.  But how's the availability? Is halo in laptops actually? What's the pricing?  And what's the bang per buck on point and this?",Neutral
Intel,"https://x.com/jaykihn0/status/1812898063502938260/photo/1  ""PTL-H 12Xe pictured."" so according to that the 55mm2 die variant is xe12",Neutral
Intel,"12 Xe cores is 60% of the 20 cores in the B580 and that's 272mm², but of course that also has GDDR memory controllers, and such that aren't needed on a GPU chiplet, but it's likely that the die for the top SKU is quite a bit bigger than 55mm², I'd say between 90 and 130 mm².",Neutral

I actually thought that AMD was forced to do so, by Filthy Green's GPP effectively banning AMD dGPUs. Typing this from G15 AMD Advantage Edition TUF.",Neutral
Intel,What matters is the intel chip regardless of actual die size runs on quad channel LPDDR memory instead of the octa channel of strix halo and is fitting into mid and small size laptops 15-45w.,Neutral
Intel,Then how is the exynos 2600 using rdna4 fron samsung if it doesn't scale?,Neutral
Intel,RDNA5 doesn't exist. The actual name for the next generation architecture is UDNA1.,Neutral

Companies CAN afford this because they need to ride the ai wave, but consumers can't because the average PC cost almost doubled.",Negative
Intel,"Wow! Excellent. Hopefully we'll see the products coming to market soon, and hopefully the 2 P cores won't matter as much since we're seeing a major lithography improvement. Intel is really impressing me lately.",Positive
Intel,This. Plus even lunar lake outperformed Strix Point in many scenarios already. Intel is at least one generation ahead here,Positive
Intel,"It's not the 4050 at 60W. The laptop they compared only allows for 30W to the 4050. Nvidia's specs for the 4050 is 35W minimum, so I don't know how Dell even got to 30W. Below a certain wattage, gpu performance decreases exponentially because a minimum level of power is required to even have the gpu turned on.   Panther Lake is built on Intel 18A, which is supposed to be much better than the 'ancient' TSMC 5nm the 4050 is built on. The 4050's cpu is also Arrow Lake, which is less efficient than Lunar Lake. Again, that skews the agenda.   You can already game on thin and light devices with discrete graphics. Laptops like Asus's G14 is only 3.3lb, but sports a 4060 which is like twice as fast as intel's new igpu. The dgpu turns itself off when on battery, and the integrated graphics takes over. Anything more intensive should be used with a charger plugged in.   In short, paying for a big igpu doesn't make much sense for anyone interested in performance. And gaming handhelds? Does anyone really care about those useless bricks for investment into integrated graphics? It's not like the cost of Panther Lake is going to be cheap when its laptops start at $1300. With that kind of money, you can get 2025 Asus Zephyrus G14 with a 5060 and blow its shit out the water. Or for those on a budget, 5050 laptops have been seen for $600.   Integrated graphics have come so far, pairing Intel's newest 18A Panther Lake with an RTX 4050 could still make a lot of sense.",Negative
Intel,"Ehh not the mayority but *all* computers use iGPUs. The thing is, for the average Joe aka 95% of the market, there won't be a difference in the usage between an Intel Iris or RTX 5090 dGPU. And the efficiency would only come into place if they would game on battery (who does that anyways) or create/edit videos (again, virtually no one would do that without a dGPU). And even then, having your laptop drained in 2 hours 15 minutes instead of 2 hours is not ""gamechanging""   So it does not affect the efficiency at all during webbrowsing, watching videos, creating documents etc.  Thats also the reason why Intel has the non X 5,7,9 which will properly be by far the more demanded version as, again, the average Joe does not care the slightest about iGPU.  And apart from the iGPU, PTL is just a tiny step up from the Ultra 200 series...",Neutral

Intel,"How are you determining that AMD has a ""lead""?  In terms of Marketshare, Intel absolutely dominates x86, especially mobility (laptops), and if you walk into a Best Buy and ask 10 random customers ""Would you ever consider buying an AMD laptop?"", five of them would ask ""What's AMD?"", another three would say ""Isn't that a budget brand?"" (Their ""awareness"" of the zeitgeist of PC hardware is stuck in 2005), and maybe, and that's a big maybe, two out of ten would have a favorable opinion of AMD hardware so long as they've been paying attention for the last few years.  In terms of budget and expenditure, in 2025, Intel spent $17 billion in R&D versus AMD's $7.4 billion, outsizing it by a large amout. Total sales for 2025 are projected at approximately $53 billion for Intel and $33 billion for AMD.  I see this all the time and I've seen it for the past 8 years.... the only place that AMD has a ""lead"" is in the mind of PC hardware enthusiasts.... because it's not in the numbers as seen above (sales, expenditure, market share, etc), and it's not in the ""mindshare"" of your average consumer.  Hypothetically speaking, we could say that in a duopoly, as with Intel/AMD in x86, the BEST situation a consumer could hope for would be an even 50%/50% split in marketshare.... this would bring about the fiercest competition and would hopefully lower prices, increase innovation, etc. (and yet another reason why any fanboy who wants their favored company to dominate is LITERALLY cheering against their own interests as a consumer) Even with AMD's seriously impressive turnaround, their capture of marketshare, their ability to compete with two of the largest companies in the world while having considerably fewer resources, they still have a very, very, long way to go before approaching 50% of the x86 market across all segments.  In fact, to get any closer to that idealistic 50/50 split, AMD would have to continue winning and Intel losing for for many more years.  In other words, fears that AMD is ""becoming what Intel used to be"" and ""getting lazy"" are not an accurate reflection of the reality.",Neutral

Intel,"No, not really. Making up a ""winner"" is stupid and nothing but fanboy behavior.  A faster dGPU is generally better because you’re generally not power limited on a desktop. It doesn’t really matter whether or not you have a 5060 or 5090 or whatever.  In mobile systems it’s a huge difference.  There are entirely different power classes that don’t compete with each other. A thin and light notebook with a 15W CPU cannot have a 100W CPU in it.  Panther lake aims towards unplugged performance which is the 45W power class and the same as Strix Point.  Strix Halo is a much higher power class that requires a laptop to be plugged in permanently for the full performance.  It’s for mobile desktops that are usually plugged in but can be mobile for some time with heavily degraded performance.  It’s an entirely different class of product and you won’t find (many) devices where Strix Halo and Strix Point/Panther Lake compete with each other.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, i am gonna contend that either that is wrong, and is the 4xe version, or that intel basically lied on their benchmarks.  If none of those two things are true, Intel's new graphics architecture will absolutely dominate in the next round of discrete graphics GPUs.  with B580 intel needed \~80% more silicon to match nvidia performance. Now they need \~10-20% less die area. meaning their performance per transistor basically doubled gen/gen. which is unheard of. Even maxwell (largest architectural uplift in the history of GPUs in the last 10 years) did not achieve anything close to that. And it was a massive overhaul with huge changes.

AMD cant do with RDNA 3.5. id expect 8060s to be a much more powerful igpu but it is lacking what is essentially lossy compression for realtime graphics. that is a pretty big deal and i do think it will be what causes Strix halo to be a product that just ages poorly, costs too much for what it is really (308mm^2 io/igpu chiplet cant be cheap on 4nm) its really amds pipe cleaner for future packing tech.  people said they same when the zen chiplets were rumored to be the size they are. you save a lot of area not needing memory controller on that chip would be my guess. d2d bonding is very space efficient compared  for some perspective strix halo igpu block + media engine block is about 120mm^2 on N4P(143.7216MTr/mm^2) of the iod, the rest is i/o and the npu.  the 12 Xe3 chip is 55mm^2 on N3E(216MTr/mm^2) (so we could napkin approximate about 80mm^2 if it was on N4P)",Neutral

The Pantherlake datasheet isn't public yet, but you can see plainly in the [actual spec sheet](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/memory-controller-mc/) for Arrowlake H that it supports 8 channels of LPDDR5X (additional [spec](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/supported-memory-modules-and-devices/) for channel width).

You cannot gang these channels into a dual channel mode, that is not how modern memory works, and there is no allowance in the LPDDR5 spec for 64b channels. The 16b channels have separate command/address buses and burst for a sufficient length (32n) to fill a cache line with each access.  To be clear I think standardising on 64b ""channels"" for marketing specifications is a good thing, it allows quick mental calculation of memory bandwidth without having to get into the nitty gritty.

This isn't exactly surprising to me, as I researched my GPU options to death before buying one, and the general consensus is that Nvidia is stronger in the ray tracing department. But if I were to boot up, say, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, a game that supports ray tracing at 60 fps on the base Play Station 5, could I expect it to perform better than a similarly demanding game that wasn't particularly optimized for AMD hardware?  It's largely hypothetical question, as I already own the GPU, am satisfied with the GPU, and of course did my due diligence before buying the GPU so I would know exactly what to expect.

Now my RX 9070 XT is not detected at all in BIOS or Windows Device Manager, and I only get display output from the motherboard.  WHAT HAPPENED To see the old SATA SSD in the boot menu I had to enable CSM in the BIOS. Booting into that drive resulted in a black screen. I then used a Live USB to run the boot-repair utility with the recommended repair settings. This seems to have installed the GRUB partition onto my Crucial T500 M.2 drive instead of the SATA drive. Now I can boot into both OSs, but the GPU is completely invisible to the system.  CURRENT STATUS Windows Device Manager only shows the Integrated Graphics. When I try to install AMD drivers, the installer fails because it cannot detect the GPU. I was briefly able to get graphics output from my GPU by unplugging the PC, flipping the PSU switch to off, and holding the power button to empty the capacitors. I then booted it up with the HDMI cable plugged into my GPU and I saw the asrock logo but it was stuck there for 2 minutes and I impatiently turned it off. I'm also considering trying this again and letting it run it's course  PLAN AND QUESTIONS I am planning to disconnect the SATA SSD and try to wipe the Ubuntu boot entries from the M.2 drive to see if the GPU reappears. Has anyone experienced a Linux bootloader repair or CSM toggle hiding a GPU from the BIOS? Specifically, could the Crucial T500 and ADATA drive conflict be causing PCIe initialization issues after the CSM change? Should I try clearing the CMOS first? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Intel,So many think memory bandwidth matters more than it does. The 5060 ti has less bandwidth than the B580. Architecture matters a lot.  More bandwidth would do next to nothing for it.,Negative
Intel,AMD cards have upscaling and framegen as well...,Neutral
Intel,"Can you elaborate what do you mean by ""AI speed""?",Neutral
Intel,No. Dlss and frame gen is much less impactful in terms of performance boost at the low end and the latency is more noticeable. It’s also half the vram.,Negative
Intel,WOW 25 so far for the TRUTH. HUB and fooling now.,Positive
Intel,"Yes, same processor, 5600x",Neutral
Intel,"yeah seriously, here b580 is noticably cheaper for example.",Negative
Intel,"Yeah, I just wanted to point it out because there’s people like me to whom prices in dollars means nothing (or who don’t read the title) and then waste time watching an irrelevant video (though I skipped to the conclusion so not that much time).🙂",Negative
Intel,"Point being? If a cap blows because it's old any repair shop can fix it, If it's a fan dying you can fix that yourself.  On the other side there's not much the warranty can do for running out of VRAM.",Negative
Intel,"In this economy? It doesn't make any sense to not keep perfectly usable hardware that does the job just fine out of a landfill.   A 2080ti or a 3070 or AMD equal is more than enough performance for most people. Easily, and is way better bang for your buck.",Neutral
Intel,"In a time of global economic uncertainty, it's a horrendous time to overspend on hobbies.",Negative
Intel,"heat, noise, size, messy cables",Negative
Intel,"Correct, but they do not have commercial dlss support. How many games do you not have the ability and ww do?   Thanks for the dowmvotes nvidia. Amd brainwashed.   Just to let you know: you have all been played. Look closer.",Negative
Intel,"They're seemingly referring to the speed of running LLMs locally using that GPU, unless I'm also out of the loop. A good sub to look into that stuff would be /r/LocalLLM   I wouldn't recommend doing that with a 5060 but the 16gb version must be the best choice in that price range and would handle the very small models easily and the small ones with a little slowness.",Neutral
Intel,"News flash: We're always in ""this economy"". I know someone who works at a fucking McDonalds, has a kid, and spends more money on his hobbies than you do.",Negative
Intel,nothing global about it,Neutral
Intel,"So you prefer low power for lower heat and smaller size.   I'm not space conscious, so those things don't matter.   What's with messy cables? The PC sits under the table, so it also doesn't matter how ugly it is.",Negative
Intel,"Well actually people have been modding games to put FSR where neither AMD or NVIDIA added official support.   Pretty much every game had amd nvidia and even intel upscaling these days.   In fact, when i still had my 3080ti, i was able to use AMD’s framegen in many games (cyberpunk, dying light, talos principle) because NVIDIA didnt provide any option for 3000 series.   I still bought nvidia because amd doesnt offer any cards at 5080 level, so no brainwashing here. You’re completely uneducated blinded by consumerism",Neutral

Intel,"If you spend more on your hobbies than the things you actually need, you might be financially irresponsible",Negative
Intel,"the unhinged extra power cables attached to the card itself, it makes everything harder to handle  and heat isn't just about the size of the case, it's noise and comfort of the room  and no, AC doesn't solve that as it's another source of noise that is even worse than the PC itself, only to be used when the weather is too bad to live otherwise",Negative
Intel,"Oh yeah? And who do you think had went through hundreds of accounts taking about that mod?   Came out DEC 22 2023 I remember the day I went from 22fps in Alan wake 2 to 50 (3070). I posted in this site non stop ban after ban just to try and get you this information. Go on the forums you will pick me out if you look back.   I, in all seriousness, would not be surprised if you know about that mod from ME.   Therefore, I am not blinded. I simply understand that an entire company propped up by manipulation on social media (and GPU) should not exist, and a real competitor would be in their place. There I have just demonstrated that not only am I not blinded, it might be you. Good on you for knowing about that mod (serious).   I will tell you another secret, maybe not meant for you. If you don't mind using dlss and mfg? 5060ti 16gb all day for 1440p or lower.

Intel,"This is a very underwhelming update for RDNA 4 users I get that this technology needs to mature, but they should already be at a point where the implementation is across more wide array of games.

Not to mention the drivers where stutters and lower fps without frame gen. Thanks,Negative

Intel,"u/AMD_Vik It says ""Intermittent application freeze when using the in-game Radeon™ Overlay."" in fixed issues but I've actually had my whole system lock up because of what seemed to be adrenalin having issues with the performance overlay....  I noticed one thing that pointed towards the overlay specifically: I was going through Adrenalin and when I was on the recording tab I switched to performance; it seemed like Adrenalin froze so I clicked Smart Tech. to see if it would respond.  Initially it didn't, before eventually swapping to the smart technology screen. I then went back to the record tab and tried again: same results.  That's about all I've got for specific steps. I closed Adrenalin and went back to doing whatever and I noticed my fans turned on and like two minutes later when I went to close my browser my cursor stopped before I got to the corner of my screen and I needed to hard power down my system.

Intel,Tagging u/AMD_Vik  so they are aware of the issues.       I encountered the same problems on my 6800xt. Figma on chrome is causing random BOSD. The system will just restart without notice.

Intel,Ok I thought I was the only one having the enhanced sync issue because no one replied to any of my posts about it. I use it because then I can lock my fps to 120 (on a 4K OLED TV) and use enhanced sync instead of Vsync because of the screen tearing when locking to 120. Now I have to do the frame lock to 117 which is fine but just annoying me I'm missing out on 3 fps lol it was causing issues in a few games where it would stutter like crazy and it all came down to enhanced sync. I don't use noise suppression so I don't know what's up with that.,Negative

Intel,"Which driver are you currently on? I'm just curious; personally, I'm on 25.9.2, and surprisingly, I have 0 problems, unlike with previous versions. Should I try 25.12.1?",Positive
Intel,"Nope. Generally if the driver does not massively increases performance in some game, or you don't have any issues or the issue you have isn't fixed, then it's not worth updating, unless there is some new feature you want.    I reverted back to 25.9.1 (from the top of my head) because with any newer driver BF6 crashes randomly, and neither DICE nor AMD seem to give a damn about it.    And before someone asks, I tried any other fix on the internet for Battlefield and nothing else worked.",Negative

Intel,What about a secondhand 5070ti?,Neutral
Intel,"I mean, I wouldn't get either. 5070 TI is a sidegrade from the XTX, and 5080 is only slightly better. DLSS and RT would be the only reason.",Neutral
Intel,Sidegrading for an upscaler sounds like a joke.,Negative
Intel,"I think Linux developers are doing some experiments As of now, FSR 4 (FidelityFX Super Resolution 4) does not officially support RDNA 2 or RDNA 3 GPUs, even on Linux. However, thanks to Develer’s work on VKD3D-Proton 3.0, there is partial and unofficial support for RDNA 3 under specific conditions.  RDNA 3: Partial Support via Develer’s VKD3D-Proton  - Develer’s VKD3D-Proton 3.0 includes support for FP8 (8-bit floating point), which is required for FSR 4. - This means RDNA 3 GPUs (like RX 7600, 7900 XT/XTX) can run FSR 4 in some games via Proton, even though AMD doesn’t officially enable it. - Global override toggles in AMD’s 25.9.1 driver can bypass the FSR 4 whitelist, allowing it to run in FSR 3.1-compatible games.  I hope they succed it will be a slap in the face.",Neutral

Now before I get kicked to death by angry people, there is a version of FSR Redstone that uses and INT8 path that is compatible and will work on 2 and 3, however that has not been launched today and AMD have not confirmed it will be.   That isn't to say they won't do it, but right now it's not been announced.

Core clock boosts itself WAY past what it is declared on the card(I got a Sapphire 9070XT Nitro, supposed to be 3060MHz). Here's the moment before it crashes to a black screen:  [afterburner screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/3YpJFtzM/Screenshot-2025-12-21-030537.png)  The dip in clocks is the moment it crashes. As you can see, it is running well above boost clocks. Hence, freezing in a few minutes, proceeded by a black screen, and a crash. The ups and downs are from me alt tabbing in the graphs, by  the way.   This is with core clock -200mhz applied in Afterburner and no crashes, boosts to just above declared boost clocks. Here the dips in up and down on power are probably me toying around how much exactly -mhz is needed.

Intel,Still not working AMD NOISE S,Negative
Intel,New Game Support: ARC Raiders  I updated to this driver thinking it would be better for ARC Raiders since that is what I am playing right now but my game is crashing if I try to load into the Blue Gate map. I tried restarting my computer and it still happens. I almost lost all my gear because it took me a bit to roll back my drivers to 25.10.2. Come on AMD do better! It's a supported game on this driver! I surprisingly never had crashes in 25.10.2 unless I toggled the Adrenalin game overlay.  Running a 9060 XT and a 5900X.,Neutral
Intel,"I updated from 25.10.2 and saw the bug report tool pop up after restarting. I had no idea what caused it. I launched Battlefront 2 and the entire system froze, with WinAmp trying to play audio which sounded horrendous. I uninstalled Adrenalin, used DDU to clear everything then did a fresh install of 25.11.1.  On restart, the bug report tool showed again. This time Wallpaper Engine failed to show on the second monitor. I quit the program and started it again and boom - system freezes entirely.  So, this driver apparently has big issues with Wallpaper Engine. Uninstalled, DDU'd, fresh install of 25.10.2 and smooth sailing ever since.",Negative

Intel,"I started having an issue since the 25.11.1 update with unreal editor where all of my tools menus instantly close, nothing else changed except for this driver update and I've heard of Nvidia having similar issues with driver updates in the past so I think it may be the cause, Going to revert to an older driver and see if it works",Negative
Intel,"I've spent the last few days uninstalling, reinstalling, DDUing, doing everything I could think of to get Adrenaline to start/work. It would show the splash screen and then quit. No way of re-starting it. Couldn't open anything that used Vulkan and got errors. Couldn't install the Windows Store version cause ""driver error"". I eventually used DDU one last time and uninstalled everything AMD and was able to just install the driver through MyASUS. Now I'm able to open all the software again that wasn't starting before. I'll be holding off on installing Adrenaline again anytime soon. Sucks cause I want the features, but I couldn't use the programs anyway. I miss having nvidia.",Negative

Intel,Last driver crashes Apex Legends every joined game. Im fuckin over amd.,Negative
Intel,Support for Anno 117: Pax Romana - Incorrect. I have needed to downgrade back to 25.9.2 to play Anno 117: Pax Romana without crashing. The last updates have been a joke. I now cannot use adrenaline due to needing to play on this earlier version to be able to play any new games. Does anyone know of where I can express my complaints?  Edit: This is also the same for Arc Raiders.,Negative
Intel,"Here we go again, jetzt stürzt Battlefield 6 wieder ab. Mit dem Treiber davor hatte ich es in den Griff bekommen außer XMP war aktiviert, dann stürzte es dennoch ab.    Also es scheint definitiv ein AMD Treiber Problem zu sein.    Gut das bei euch die Kunden die Tester sind und nicht ihr das übernehmen müsst.  PS: Gespielt wird mit einer 7900XT und einem 7800X3D.      Das war definitiv meine erste und letzte Karte von AMD. So viel Probleme hatte ich mit Team Grün nicht.",Neutral

Intel,"I have this but on display port, HDMI works fine",Neutral
Intel,"DDU with full uninstall of all AMD related things and then chipset driver install, fresh GPU driver install fixed the crash from wakeup for me.",Neutral
Intel,"I had to go back to version 25.9.2 but I no longer have AMD Adrenalin. If I try to install it, it reinstalls version 25.11, which crashes my game. Is it necessary to have AMD Adrenalin? I have a 7900 XTX and a Ryzen 9 7950X3D.",Negative
Intel,Could you try a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter? I wonder if it works in this situation =D,Neutral
Intel,I have the same issue with display port but it’s okay with hdmi :/,Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, I plan to make sure my next display has Display Port in it. Mostly for linux though.",Positive
Intel,"There will already be branching inside the code of the driver. This has been the case already, to various degrees, for years. It's not new.  It's just whether AMD wants to formally spread those branches out on a file / compilation level and distribute different packages. And then publicly whether they commit to updating all branches of code or only some.  For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch. Of course, we have very little outside insight into the exact spread of these cases that AMD wants to pay their engineers to work on.",Neutral
Intel,There is a separate code path for specific things bit both are in those combine driver. Its mostly about certain ray tracing extensions   There are also fp8 and fp16 codepaths    People misunderstand and thought its like pre rdna stuff.,Neutral
Intel,"V25.10.2  here… I have both CPU and GPU by AMD and if you download the specific package, they install drivers only for the specific hardware (and they have different dimensions). For installing both drivers you have to download the AutoDetect package.  EDIT: typo",Neutral
Intel,"I'm one of the 5 people still running a Vega 64 and for years we've had a separate driver ""branch"" despite being able to install new Adrenaline versions. Bf6 beta wouldn't run without spoofing my actual internally installed driver, which hadn't been updated since they dropped support.",Negative
Intel,combined again it looks like 🤷‍♂️,Neutral
Intel,the display team are working on this with priority. Hoping to have this out in the next release. There are two similar display issues on their radar which are both P1.,Neutral

Intel,"Are y'all playing on televisions? HDMI isn't really optimal for modern monitors, with DisplayPort being the better spec for computer graphics.  Not criticizing, just curious as to use-case.",Neutral
Intel,You try install last chipset driver ?,Neutral
Intel,"Bummer you're having issues. Hopefully AMD gets it straightened out for you. Out of curiosity, why did you decide to use HDMI on your monitor instead of display port? I thought HDMI was mostly used for TVs nowadays.",Negative
Intel,So it's the driver that's why that happens 😡 and it's not fixed?,Negative
Intel,Thank you for your service,Positive
Intel,"I've had the ""device_hung"" error and the best drivers are those you are on.   AMD needs a lot of help with their drivers...",Negative
Intel,Any update mate?,Neutral
Intel,"No, radeon drivers update cannot upgrade your CPU so that it would stop bottlenecking your GPU.",Negative

Intel,I'm playing it on 7900 GRE with FSR4 INT8 with no issues.,Positive
Intel,na it works the problem only occures when using PathTracing and you are not going to play on an AMD card with PT anyways and especially not a 7700XT,Negative
Intel,"I played recently the latest patch of Cyberpunk 2077 with RX 7700 XT with drivers from February this year, 25.2.1 and had no issues, no stutter, no lag, no crashes, the problem is with path tracing or ray tracing something, you don't have to use that even and it lowers fps probably for very little visual gain.",Positive
Intel,If it still crashes set RTX Global Illumination to Static.,Negative
Intel,"pretty sure anti lag was causing my system to freeze up when in arc raiders on 25.10. turned it on and issues, turned it off and haven't had issues since",Negative
Intel,"Optimizing has nothing to do with fixing crashing, generally, that would be bug fixing.",Negative
Intel,"The only Redstone component that will work through the driver for upgrading existing features (like FSR3 FG) will be ML FG, but only for games that have FSR 3.1.4+(and FSR FG), as they’ve already announced in a GPUOpen article quite a while ago.   Ray Regeneration (RR) and Neural Radiance Cache (NRC) require dev implementation since they’re much deeper in engine code/inputs.",Neutral
Intel,"Does BO7 have ray tracing? Where is that feature mentioned, would be keen to read about it 🤓",Positive
Intel,"Itll probably work through optiscaler, but a game like indiana jones has locked dlss inputs, so you need dev implementation",Neutral
Intel,"And all my USB devices dropped for a while, far worse experience than the usual double screen flicker & it's done.  Edit: seems like that was because of iGPU driver for my Zen4. In the end and after 6+ reinstalls, I'm stopping on 25.9.1 and have Vulkan working again.",Negative
Intel,What is wrong with CP? Just got my 9070 after 10+ years of nvidia :o   Ah nvm i see it.,Negative
Intel,Ugh,Neutral
Intel,"Most likely when your distro provides a kernel update.  I'd give this a quick read: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-update-and-see-what-graphics-driver-you-have-on-linux-and-steamos/  Pretty much the default is that you will be using the Mesa driver collection and they were last updated yesterday.  The fixes there do not correlate with the ones in this thread (I think).  As long as you are on a ""cutting edge"" type distro then you can expect that update in the next few days/weeks.  If you are on a ""stable"" distro that doesn't update often, you may be waiting a realllly long time.",Neutral
Intel,"Get what exactly? Features? Bug fixes? Optimizations?   Every 2 weeks there are new Mesa driver updates with bug fixes and performance optimizations. As for features, you have to wait a few months for versions with big numbers (25.2 is soon updating to 25.3, adding Anti-lag 2).   Depending on your distribution, you can get these updates faster or slower.",Neutral
Intel,"Linux doesn’t work like windows. You get updates directly via Mesa stack. When your distro provides mesa package update, that’s when you get driver updates, and they’re completely different from windows branch.",Neutral
Intel,just uninstall it I prefer manual check myself.,Negative
Intel,So AMDs default driver overclocks and doesn’t reflect that in the values?,Neutral
Intel,Same issues here i underclocked it but this new update just made it worse,Negative
Intel,ok it is still crashing ... complete reboot :(,Negative
Intel,"I feel like that crash is more on DICE's side, since Nvidia users get the same exact crash, although less often.  I tried everything I saw on the internet, nothing really works. Sometimes I can play for hours on end, other time game just crashes randomly after 10-15 minutes.  I am going to try to downgrade to 25.9.1 and see how it fares, since I remember that driver being really stable for me (6800XT).  Edit: been playing for 4 hours, no crash yet. Never had such a long session without the game crashing.  Will update in the next few days.  Edit 2: haven't crashed once, been playing at least 2 hours every evening.",Negative
Intel,Okay.,Neutral
Intel,I’m hoping Valve’s new steam machine will push them on that since it’s RDNA3 based.,Neutral
Intel,The RT/PT reflections leading to CTDs issue? We're working with CDPR to resolve this - it's not caused by the driver software.,Neutral
Intel,"Stuff like this is honestly bugging me.  First AMD card and while it is okay to have some driver issues, stuff like that shouldn't be a thing at all. It can't be that some bugs keep existing for multiple months let alone more than half a year.",Negative
Intel,A much more fundamental thing like playing video in a window without stuttering took 3 or 4 driver updates.,Neutral

Intel,welcome to amd,Positive
Intel,Yeah hoping it works. I guess the point about crashing with easy anticheat was the fix? Doesn't specifically mention but it was with raytracing enabled I was getting the crash. I suppose we shall find out.,Neutral
Intel,"Weird. I was running 10.2 and things were running fine for the most part. I kept getting a pop-up on launch saying there was a known issue with that driver and Arc Raiders though, so I rolled it back to 9.2 and had more issues on that release than the one with the stated problems.  My fan control profile broke and stopped tracking gpu temp so last night I did a clean DDU install back to 10.2.  Of course 12 hrs later the new release drops haha  Hopefully Fan Control continues to play nice if I just update",Negative
Intel,Same. Never even had Ryzen master installed.,Negative

Intel,The new AFMF features were added in 25.10.2 - Still waiting for AFMF 3.0 at this stage,Neutral
Intel,Suggest if you are using powertoys to stop... After their last game update it was crashing left and right. Powertoys was cause. I only crashed once and I believe it was cfeen blanking was cause for that. I was away too long.,Negative
Intel,"Fps drop over time? That's a game issue, it's got a memory leak",Negative
Intel,"What kind of FPS drops? I was having dog shit frame pacing, and hardcore drops to like sub 60 FPS at 1440p medium/high with a 6950XT. I went through every setting and found that anti-lag was the culprit. Once I turned that off it all went away. Then with future frame rendering it got even smoother.

Intel,are you able to install driver only with the newest drivers? When i choose minimal or driver only it still install full version of the software anyway. Only 25.9.1 works perfectly.,Neutral
Intel,Yeah... it can happen. I was already locked outside windows after a bsod with my old nvidia card. I had to use a linux usb drive to fix it through the command line.,Negative

It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.   While digging into my issue, I wanted to see if DP2.0 / uhbe20  compatible display would have these issues, but my current display only has HDMI2.1 and dp1.4.  Hopefully someone else had experience with them on 4k 240hz.",Negative

Intel,"Appreciate you reaching out with this - that's an interesting data point to consider.  In this case, the quirky behaviour with HDMI 2.1 + FRL was attributed to a change made in the display stack, I don't think it explicitly involves display stream compression to repro, just high enough display bandwidth (though I could be mistaken)",Positive
Intel,"Interesting. I've been experiencing random BSODs on my PC too on a fresh Win11 install too, I was also suspecting it was something to do with auto HDR toggle but I didn't know for sure.  I'm running 180hz 1440 LG panel but I don't recall if it's using hdmi or DP.

Intel,"It has nothing to do with the lack of vulkan support, even when fsr4 comes to vulkan, the game still needs ray regeneration implementation from the devs, you cant use optiscaler through dlss inputs, like you probably will be able to in fx alan wake 2",Negative
Intel,I suppose is going to be fixed as soon as Amd Redstone go out. Basically is going to add every tecnology that Path tracing needs to work. Off course the devs would have to implement them in the game too,Neutral
Intel,"The issue is if you try to use path tracing. Which to be fair, you probably shouldn't unless the miracle of them getting Virtuous to implement Ray Regeneration in Cyberpunk happens.",Negative

Intel,Hmm fair. For me on 9070XT if I had raytracing enabled it would crash most regularly on loading back to the menu after extraction which was annoying but at least not game destroying lol. But yeah annoying enough that I turned RT off entirely.   I hope this means I can turn it back on because the game runs well enough for it.,Negative
Intel,"Yes. So far, so good. I'm not 100% sure what fixed it.      I uninstalled both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master standalone applications. Deleted the ""amdryzenmasterv"" keys. Rebooted.  Then I installed Adrenalin and used the Ryzen Master installer in Adrenalin (Performance > Metrics > Install Ryzen Master).  I think this problem might have something to do with a handshake breaking between Ryzen Master and Adrenalin, after upgrading just Adrenalin.   From now on, I'll probably do clean installs, removing and reinstalling both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master, through Adrenalin Performance tab.",Positive
Intel,"My last two processors are ryzen amd, my last three video cards are amd radeon and next one will be amd also, nvidia has driver issues as well, to be honest.

Intel,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.

Intel,"Hi. Sorry, I thought this was pretty common as I've had this issue with two different systems and 3 AMD GPUs across 2 generations. [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1jayump/chrome_full_screen_freezes_after_switching_to_amd/) [Or here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/3890720/parts-of-screen-freezes-when-using-chrome) Chrome (or other Chromium browsers, I've had this happen with Edge too) in fullscreen, with graphics acceleration enabled.   Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind this only actually matters if one protocol or the other is **actually** limiting bandwidth for the [resolution * FPS] you want to display on your monitor  For instance, DP 1.4 can do ~25Gbits/s, which translates to roughly 1440p @ 240fps, or 4k @ 120fps  If you have proper cable into HDMI 2.1, it should be able to do ~42Gbits/s, which would instead be 4k @ 190fps  Read up the wikipedia tables for bandwidth specs and resolution / fps / bit depth rates for more",Neutral

Intel,"Could be it, nothing hardware wise at all and just software too.     Yeah, you're not the 1st I've read that says they have issues on the game.     If you're crashing and the system reboots it does make me think of some stability issues and not really just GPU, but I'm guessing you've already tried stability tests and using the system without OC+A-XMP/EXPO disabled.     Once upon a time I remember reading some people, on other instances and other games, having crashes like that (complete reboot) due to PSU instability as well.     Good luck!",Neutral

Intel,"It's not freezing, it's just that the GPU usage is practically at 100% all the time, even with V-Sync enabled. With the 25.9 drivers, this doesn't happen, and the clock speed varies normally, increasing and decreasing as needed when V-Sync is enabled. These 25.10 drivers are causing the GPU to consume more energy unnecessarily.",Neutral
Intel,Fingers crossed,Positive
Intel,"Thanks for attempting to retest.  It's a 7900XTX with an Index connected via DisplayPort. I am on the latest 25.11.1 driver.  I run a monitor at 4k 120Hz 10bpc with HDR Off, which uses DSC, as my main and only display. I tried disabling DSC in the monitor settings which runs at 4k 120Hz 8bpc with HDR Off but I don't think I noticed a change in latency. I thought that DSC on and off on two different devices might contribute to the problem but I'm not sure.   I have also tried running the Index under a RX480 on another PC and I fairly certain the latency looks different under 90Hz and looks similar under 120Hz. Can't play much to test though as an RX480 runs the Index at a very blurry setting. Getting around to doing this test is what took me so long to reply.",Neutral

Intel,since last BF6 Update i had zero crashes also on 25.11.1,Positive
Intel,"That's not how it works. Small print won't save you from stuff like this, you think that they can stop releasing this software for 2-3 years because some small print said 'Subject to change'?   European consumer law would absolutely support the consumer in this case. If you promise a feature by a certain date, you will need to deliver it.

Intel,"Brawndo has electrolytes, that's what plants crave!",Positive
Intel,"Works in Windows too. But Windows has way too much overhead for all of the AI garbage, ads and integrated spyware running in the background to still be a usable operating system. Linux is much better.   The drivers install all side-by-side, and all GPUs show up as OpenCL devices. In the software you can then select which one to run on.   FluidX3D can select multiple OpenCL devices at once, each holding only one part of the simulation box in its VRAM. So VRAM of the GPUs is pooled together, with communication happening over PCIe.",Neutral

The rendering is done multi-GPU too, as domain decomposition rendering. Each GPU knows only a part of the whole fluid simulation box in VRAM and can't see the others. It only renders its own domain, at 3D offset, to its own frame with accompanying z-buffer, and copies those to CPU over PCIe. The CPU then overlays the frames.",Neutral

Intel,That's awesome!,Positive
Intel,"Yes, but SLI is a bad description for it.",Negative
Intel,"The faster PCIe 4.0/5.0 and future iterations mean that dedicated SLI/Crossfire bridges are obsolete. The PCIe bandwidth nowadays is more than enough. And PCIe is the generic industry standard interface, easier to program for than proprietary hardware that's different for every vendor.   For games multi-GPU is gone for good (too few users, too large cost of development, no return of investment for game Studios). But in simulation/HPC/AI software multi-GPU is very common as it allows to go beyond the VRAM capacity of a single large GPU for cheaper.",Neutral
Intel,"sli/crossfire were killed for good reason, its just a bad time all around if half of your gpu's core/cache is located a foot away from the other half, unless your baseline performance is so damn low that the microstutters just get lost in the noise.  ultimately chiplet cpu/gpu designs are basically just an evolved form of sli/crossfire, and we're happily starting to get quite good at those.  (assuming we're talking about games)",Negative
Intel,"indeed it did, if only game devs adopted this more. Then again, the idea of two high end GPUs like we have today in a single PC is kinda horrifying.",Negative
Intel,"There is not really a clear limit. More PCIe bandwidth makes scaling efficiency better, less means the software will run a bit slower in multi-GPU mode. 3.0 x4 (~3.3GB/s) is just enough for reasonable efficiency.",Neutral

PC will perform the best if OS is located on the closest one.   Much better off just slapping two GPUs together in a single form factor than two separate GPUs.

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative
Intel,One thing I appreciate about AMD is having the lowest CPU overhead for their graphics drivers. Makes a difference if you're CPU limited in a game.,Positive
Intel,So Nvidia now has the lowest driver overhead? Seems like they took the HUB video seriously,Neutral
Intel,So the money you save on a GPU you will need to spend on a better CPU??  Might as well get a faster GPU.,Negative
Intel,Interesting that B580 doesn't look bad at all with a 13600k. I wonder what it's like with a 13400 or 12600k. It seems like just having those extra threads provided by the e-cores takes care of the overhead it needs.,Positive

Intel,"According to the graphs, AMD has slightly less overhead than NVIDIA.",Neutral
Intel,"No, they do not.  The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software.  They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  The main example that seems to suggest otherwise is actually a demonstration of nVidia's forced threading of DX11 games, which can increase performance despite the increased overhead it entails, when the CPU has enough headroom overall (i.e. it doesn't eat into the single-thread performance).",Negative
Intel,"Lowest with DX11 and older, but not with the newer APIs",Neutral
Intel,And when is the last time HUB did a dedicated video showing the improvement in overhead?,Neutral
Intel,or it's just a cache/memory access issue,Neutral

I think this will be great for non-gaming purposes, like Adobe, Autodesk and so on. 890M should be a photo editing powerhouse.",Positive
Intel,"I mean current consoles are already APU power houses, they can give you 120fps depending on the game, and 30-60fps depending on what mode you select.

That's tapping on 4070/7800 levels of performance.",Positive
Intel,Never gonna happen as long as they use DDR memory.  The only powerful APUs are those that use GDDR or HBM. See: every AMD-powered console and the MI300A.,Negative
Intel,"Radeon iGPUs are mostly limited by the shared RAM bandwidth. I was thinking of getting an 8700G a little while ago, and the benchmarks varied wildly depending on RAM frequency and overclocks.  Maybe they'll improve it by hooking it up to a wider GDDR bus in laptops, similar to how the current PS5 and Xboxes work (IIRC?)",Neutral
Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative

Intel,"It'll need to be a custom tooled APU like Aerith/Van Gogh if it is to take full advantage of the 890m.     Nearly all of the configs that release of 16cu Point APU or 40cu Halo will be an APU slapped in a chassis without an adequate power or memory bandwidth setup for the igpu.     What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra. Its desktop tower chip is behind the entry level mobile OS chip from its competitor. It is a decade behind the desktop chips of its competitor, itis hardly Monster class.",Neutral

And AMD ""can make"" such APUs -> PS5 Pro (as a more cost effective solution). AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative
Intel,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",Negative

Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't.

Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral

Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so?

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Intel,"And I'm over here struggling to keep an Nvidia T4 passthrough to work reliably on Hyper-V to Ubuntu 22.04. :(  Is there a specific software combination that works more reliably than others?   Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.

Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.  You're free to guess what vendor om looking at to replace my CPU with. Damn shame really.",Negative
Intel,"Fact: AMD does not give a shit about any of this.   We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line.

I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

Also some other games having driver timeouts to, but i have games that also never timeout.

I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.  Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical. I guess that's why nobody is already doing it.",Neutral

All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".

Intel,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point.

After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.

Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

So in the basic but common example above, you can't really complete your job because the entire main system has to be shut down. That's like stranding 6 people because the bus broke down. And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.  I think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable.

So it may be DX feature. It very common/easy to see it in VRChat large maps, or large Unity games.  In Linux - *in some cases, but it very common* - you get more VRAM usage on Nvidia compare to AMD because this how Vulkan driver implemented in Nvidia and overhead of DXVK.  P.S. For context - Unity VRAM usage is - Unity allocating ""how much it want"" and in case of two different GPU Unity may allocate less or more in DX-API, or DX-API have some internal behavior for Unity case on Nvidia so it allocating less.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

Intel,"I've used both FSR (2160p desktop) and DLSS (1080p laptop) and the loss in quality is noticeable to me. Always a softer image with less detail - yes, even DLSS. Performance always has a cost. Temporal upscaling is no different. DLAA and FSRAA actually are better than native, since they replace terrible TAA implementations and render at native.  However, this better than native upscaling narrative seems more like a belief (or a marketing push/tactic) than reality.   - If action is high enough, it probably won't matter much, but in single-player games where I like to look around, I just can't deal with the resolution loss.

If the dual GPU version was really available for $999 right now (as announced), then Intel would make significant inroads into the local AI market.

Compared to a B60, the 3090 is readily available for $1100, and provides the same VRAM, double the compute and memory bandwidth, better perf/watt, and CUDA support.  With the dual GPU cards even at $2k each this does have one single niche - being able to get 144 GB of VRAM in a server at under 1500W for under $10k -  which is legitimately useful for LLM inference.

For refference HDMI 1.4 has 10.2Gbit/s  So as i understood it most of the data bandwidth were used for tossing the image output back and forth as only a single card were the one outputting the image (assuming you weren't running tripple monitor widescreen setup on SLI GPU's....) and our image data could more or less saturate the link  someone correct my math if i'm totally bonkers, but 2560x1440p = 3.686 million pixels. each using 24 bit (8-bit color on 3 chanels) which is 88Mbit/s. if you output 60 of those that is 5.3Gbit/s. 1GB/s = 8Gbit/s. Okay okay you wouldn't always throw a full image so lets call it 2.5Gbit. You were still using quite a lot of the bandwidth on the image alone, so from my understanding most of the interface communication was more related to ""who did what"".  and in AFR you would be handing over a full frame.",Neutral

I really, really wanted a Strix Halo laptop, but the lack of SKUs, price and the inflexibility with RAM kind of make it unappealing to say the least, not to mention the power draw compared to Panther Lake is unwelcome. These laptops are gonna be probably the best x86 in mobile has eaten in a very long time.  On top of that, it's almost making the 5050 look like a stupid part in a laptop.

Intel,"Bingo  Strix is also limited by being RDNA 3.5 and no FSR4, so it's rather dependent on raw throughput, and it can't possibly fit in a comfortable handheld that would last for more than an hour and a half under load.  I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage.

And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.  Besides, Intel already has Nova Lake AX in the backlog, or whatever it's going to be called. Practically intel's strix halo.

But all I need to know is it's faaar bigger.  >panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus  That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.",Neutral
Intel,"Well Panther uses mixed processes, and hybrid tiles are bound to be a bit less space efficient than putting everything on a single die.

A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations.

Case and point, AMD's R9 Fury X. Released with 4096bit bus HBM. Had a total memory bandwidth of 512GB/s. Yet the GTX 980 Ti released with a 384bit bus and 336GB/s memory bandwidth and it out performed the Fury X in pretty much everything.

Valve definitely wants a wider adoption rate of SteamOS and ditching x86 is not going to help that. They are **not** Nintendo that can ask devs to target their architecture. It's going well so far because for most games you can just make a standard Windows version, slap Proton and it works within 10% of native performance under optimal circumstances.

Intel,Do we know if we are getting real Nova Lake mobile chips or just a BGA version of desktop parts with a panther lake refresh?,Neutral
Intel,"The DRAM standard between LPCAMM2 and LP-DDR5x is the same - that's the point. LPCAMM2 is a replaceable implementation of LP-DDR5x memory.  But LPCAMM2 is completely different from SO-DIMM. SO-DIMM is DDR5. LPCAMM2 is LP-DDR5x.  You will see Arc B390 designs with LP-DDR5x memory down on the mainboard, and you'll see (some) LPCAMM2 designs, but they'll be far less common.

Intel,"It's not exactly weird. They went PPC before Intel because powerpc was more effective for workloads most people used macs for. The switch to Intel was just because Intel had node leadership and performance leadership. Instead stick to A-chips for low power mobile where intel gave up on servicing. Intel loses node leadership to TSMC for a long time, Apple moves on to everything in-house is a pretty logical progression.  Apple having bespoke solutions isn't new either. they've been doing it since their G workstation days. Their current situation is pretty much on brand for apple, but the difference is the huge mistakes intel made (particularly firing so many top engineers) that led to staff fleeing to other companies, including leadership at Apple processor design.  basically apple did their own thing as usual and did a great job don't get me wrong, not taking anything away from apple. the biggest difference however was intel's CEO and board destroying the company.",Neutral

That said, I’m pretty skeptical about how realistic that is. **With the recent RAM shortages and rising memory costs**, pricing a new card competitively while still keeping margins doesn’t sound easy at all. Memory is a huge part of the BOM, and we’ve already seen how shortages can push prices up across the board.  So unless Intel is willing to take a serious hit on margins (which seems unlikely), I’m not convinced the B770 will land at a price point that truly shakes up the market.

As much as I'd like to provide my technical insights on this upgrade path, I'm not in a position to provide specific suggestions since this involves hardware modifications to an OEM system.  For the best compatibility outcome and to ensure optimal system performance, I strongly recommend reaching out to your system manufacturer directly. They can provide definitive guidance on supported CPU upgrades (i5-8400 to i7-9700) and maximum RAM configurations for your specific model. We don't want to inadvertently bypass any warranty terms and conditions on your system by providing modification recommendations that might affect your coverage.  Your system manufacturer's technical support team will have access to the exact specifications, BIOS compatibility matrices, and supported hardware configurations for your Vostro 3670 model. They can confirm whether the motherboard supports the i7-9700, the maximum RAM capacity (64GB vs 128GB), and any potential limitations or requirements for these upgrades.  This approach ensures you get accurate, manufacturer-validated information while maintaining your system's warranty protection.",Neutral
Intel,"u/I_like_carsyay  XPS 15 9530 hardware does support Resizable BAR, which is why Intel's system detection shows it as available for both your Arc A370M and Iris Xe graphics.

This approach ensures optimal system performance while reducing complexity for users. I recommend checking for the latest BIOS updates from your OEM's support site and contacting their technical support team, as they would have the most current information about how ReBAR is implemented on your specific model and whether any additional configuration steps are needed to fully utilize this feature.     I've posted an article below in case you haven't yet come across it:  **Helpful Resources:**  *  [What Is Resizable BAR and How Do I Enable It?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090831/graphics.html)",Neutral

I am using a Noctua NH-D15 and a contact frame to reduce CPU temperatures.  Up until a few days ago I would have said that thread scheduling isn't an issue, but then I played the game Maneater and it's basically unplayable unless you use launch options to force the game to only P-cores. There's the Intel ""Application Optimizer (APO)"" utility but it seems abandoned and you can't add your own games if Intel hasn't added a profile. I was a big proponent of E-cores but honestly it seems like a half-baked technology that Intel never put the effort in to support properly.

Intel,"yeah it says   ""We should also make it clear that these benchmarks seem to undermine the performance of Intel's Xe2 architecture. The Arc 140V is shown much slower than the Radeon 890M, but in reality, it ends up close to or faster in actual games.

Intel,"So imagine how much faster it is in actual practice.  These iGPUs Intel are putting out are great, it's a good time for lower-power handhelds!  And insane power handhelds too, with Strix Halo getting in them, the Ryzen 388 (8c16t with 40CU iGPU) allegedly coming, and I'm sure Intel is working on an answer to Strix Halo which if it uses this kind of uArch, will probably be deadly.

Intel,Answer to strix halo was the partnership with nvidia,Neutral
Intel,Did is you see the link? Passmark graphics score? 10999 for 7600m and 9500 for b390.,Neutral
Intel,"since the 140T has 20 watts for the GPU itself, how can it be otherwise?",Neutral
Intel,"I feel like the partnership was an answer to a much broader question concerning both companies, none of it really being an implicit answer to Strix Halo beyond a vague promise to develop custom chips with Intel cores and RTX cores fuse together using nvlink.     I mean, if they actually launch something, cool. But as of now, we don't really have any information that directly points to a competing product.      In fact, I might be crazy but I feel like it is more likely that the actual answer to Strix Halo will be all Intel silicon, because Nvidia is very horny for all things ai and all things datacenter.",Neutral
Intel,"I mean no offense, but Passmark is irrelevant.  Even comparing the 890m to the 7600m (non-xt), the 7600m is usually twice as fast, with dips down to ~60% faster, and lifts up to ~170% faster.     NoteBookCheck has an extremely robust dataset of benchmarks in games for both the 890m and the 7600m (non-xt) at various resolutions, and they show not only a clear winner, but a very large difference in the performance of these devices.      Now I'm not trashing what the B390 will be, because we need an iGPU fight here.  But thinking that the 7600m (non-xt) is only ~15.7% faster than the B390 ((new-old)/old gives percent change) because of Passmark is erroneous.",Neutral

Intel,"should have a 3y warranty on it. submit an RMA ticket  regarding the actual query though, the silicon is the same the 14900ks is just a slightly better bin. you wouldn't notice the difference at stock let alone normalized for energy consumption",Neutral
Intel,"I have i9 14900ks, what I did is that I reset bios settings to optimized defaults and then I limit pl1 and pl2 to 150w and enabled XMP, these are the only two settings i changed, the rest is default, and temperatures are in check, i still get the same performance, and it’s very efficient in gaming that way, the extra heat and power consumption of 253 or 320 are not worth it, I recommend just get the ks and make these two changes and forget it.",Neutral
Intel,The performance difference will be tiny and definitely not noticeable with a 3090. Go for the cheaper chip.,Neutral
Intel,"Get the KS for better silicon quality only limit power , set pl1/2 253w and set it to 350 or 325A, definitely want the better 14900ks silicon quality it’s overall better and better IMC as well. It’s a better bin and typically only the best 14900k will run stable 6.2ghz and at lower voltages even if you limit your chip to 6ghz",Positive
Intel,If it doesn’t cost you extra then get the 14900ks and lock all the cores to 5.6 and power limit 256w,Neutral
Intel,"A 14900KS is nothing more then a binned 14900K. Running a 320W/400A extreme setting is not advisable with a AIO. I run my 14900KS on custom loop with 320W/307A performance setting and it does not thermal throttle at all. If you get lucky, you could get a 14900K that can run KS settings. Performance in that case is( should be) identical. Without benchmarks i can't really tell the difference between 125/253/307 and 320/320/400 except the heating of my room.",Negative
Intel,"As an update - I went ahead with the 14900ks and also changed my cooler to a 420mm AIO.   Ensured latest bios update then set Intel presets (performance) but also went ahead and reduced PL to 150w, set temp limits to 70c, system agent voltage to 1.12, 307A, and I was blown away by the temps!! I am getting basically identical performance (+ few fps) to my previous 13900ks, but a whole whopping 30°c cooler in game!!! I would average 80-85, now it’s sitting super chill with same in-game settings on BF6 & ARC at 50-60c.   Thank you everyone for your inputs, I sincerely appreciate it and I’m extremely happy with the outcome!",Positive
Intel,I also PL1/2 at 150. My temps stay under 60c when gaming.,Neutral
Intel,"if the cooling wasn't sufficient disable HT(useless for gaming) and undervolt it this lower CPU temperature by 20c, in games the CPU temperature should be around 65c.",Neutral
Intel,Im using a duel air tower for my 14900k game temps are at 60 to 70,Neutral
Intel,"14900KS is just a better binned 14900K. All things equal, you should have lower temps/voltage/power draw for the same exact workload/clocks on a 14900ks vs a 14900k. How big of a delta between the two comes down to how well you struck the silicon lottery with the KS.",Neutral
Intel,"I have the K version only because of the onboard gpu. In case my GPU gives issues and I'll still be able to boot. But otherwise there is almost no performance gain. I ran my i9-14900k pl on 320 watt and did a cinebench benchmark, temps were ok: average 94c, max 98c with a 360 aio.  That said, go for the cheaper version if you don't need onboard gpu.  Edit: I have my pl on 253w now. No need to go any higher.",Neutral
Intel,5 years warranty on 13 and 14gens now.    I have the 13900ks. Run it at 253w. Clock locked at 5.5ghz. Temp 80c and cinebench 23 39k,Neutral
Intel,Why not keep pl2 at 253 and 1 at 150/185 ? Did you try undervolting? Most of them can take 50mv offset with 75 /85 needing a bit more stability testing. Can also cap the vr limit and iccmax. I feel like going 150 pl2 makes you miss some performance in games unless you had thermal issues and doing it to keep it from thermal throttle.,Neutral
Intel,"Thank you for the feedback. Forgive me for the dumb question; if I ran either a 14900ks or a 14900k at these settings, would they both have the same temps? Or would the KS still run hotter?",Neutral
Intel,"Dropped the voltage further down by -0.10000 and now I’m getting 58°c core temp and max 65°c package temp under load. Really happy with this, and with some tweaks to my in-game video settings I’m able to still maintain a framerate that matches my screen refresh rate.",Positive
Intel,This post is about the K and KS. Both have the same iGPU,Neutral
Intel,even better. i take it they extended tbe warranty period for those products?,Positive
Intel,For 5.5 39k in CB23 is a little low,Neutral
Intel,"I have tried and tested all my games, i saw absolutely no difference between 253w, 150w, 125w or even 100w, the fps were exactly the same, the only difference was in temperatures, performance wise i saw no difference between any of them, i was using 100w before but then I switched to 150w because I thought it was too low, even though the performance is still the same as 100w, just higher temperatures, my cooler is pretty good kraken elite 360, it never goes above 80 even on 253w but I just like to keep temperatures between 50-70 while gaming.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah your method is better, it’s what I do.",Positive
Intel,The ks should run cooler because of the better bin. Less voltage being required to hit certain frequency points.,Neutral
Intel,"Oh shit, I thought only the K had an igpu! Should have gone for the ks version lmao",Negative
Intel,Yes because of the degrading issue.,Negative

Intel,Search on reddit on 13900-14900k.  After the code update stock most 13-14k can barely do 35k. Dont like to your ego brother.

In addition Intel has their chiplet design, EMIB that could take off soon. They may be able to bring Apple back into the fold, but let us hope Discrete Arc lives on.

Intel,"These are European links and will be out of stock. I found a mom and pop place back in my old stomping grounds in San Francisco, and they normally only sell B60s in prebuilt systems but a special order is possible.   Intel can't rely on TSMC for Battlemage supply, so let us pray that Discrete Celestial GPUs are made (entirely) at IFS and release in 2026 / 2027.   May your Bits Byte Hard, long live the Arc.",Neutral
Intel,"If CES 2026 comes and goes without any details for Discrete Arc GPUs then it could be awhile. The main thing being promoted is Panther Lake which should be made entirely at IFS, a step in the right direction. The TSMC monopoly is destroying the industry and it hurts companies here in the US.",Negative
Intel,Not sure how the link being European matters. They are European shops and the B60 is in stock.,Neutral
Intel,"We kind of know where it will land. It will be a 3050M level chip, maybe a bit better, but will have improve scaling and frame gen.   8060S is 40 RDNA 3.5 units. One Xe3 unit is about 2.1 RDNA 3.5 units. That put it at about 65% of Strix Halo, though it will have a worse memory bus and no MALL cache. Somewhere in that range.   So that 60% is almost bang on the 3050M. Maybe a bit better. It won’t be like the 4050 but 3050M isn’t bad for an iGPU that fits in a normal socket",Neutral
Intel,"> and no MALL cache  PTL does have 8MB of memory side cache, fwiw.",Neutral
Intel,"I don’t know how this score compares to the 3050M. I only know that this score is about 55% of the B580. And the B580, at 2K and 4K, is about 1.7–2 times the performance of the desktop 3050",Neutral
Intel,and also an iGPU won't be stuck with 6GB of vRAM 😅,Neutral
Intel,Really don't understand why they don't go with a larger cache.  Pretty sure they still have a bunch of cache chunks spread all around the SoC.,Negative
Intel,"in configs without die-to-die memory performance in general should be worse if bandwidth limited. despite not being specifically dedicated to onboard memory like Lunar, people are still planning configs with local LPDDR5x, though peak bandwidth is limited by a 128bit bus.",Negative
Intel,I see it personally as not really being at 20W if you’re asking much from the GPU. It’ll increase the juice dynamically if it gets demanding enough. So it’ll be hard to say unless you force the power limits way down manually.,Neutral

AMD,"9% more power for 7% more performance is actually a pretty good deal, when you consider that that 9% more power is just for the CPU. Factoring in the entire energy cost of a full system, that easily amounts to a PPW uplift.",Positive
AMD,9% power for 7% performance doesn't sound that bad?,Neutral
AMD,"It's 7% in Geekbench only. There's been no other news/leaks about how it performs in other benchmarks and games so it could quite possibly see a higher increase under other loads (or conversely, see a decrease where the extra cache is not utilized).",Neutral
AMD,The main benefit is simplification of running software. You'd no longer desire to choose which CCD to pin a program to for the best experience and can just let a program use both.,Positive
AMD,It's to make the specs sheet look beefier. Actual power draw and efficiency should be virtually identical to the 9950X3D. If you increase the PPT manually to 250W on the 9950X3D you'd get similar results in everything apart from heavy cache-sensitive computing workloads.,Neutral

AMD,"afaik there has never been a correlation between geekbench and gaming performance, pretty lame how people eat up the headlines even if they're meaningless",Negative

If you use the last one, you obviously need to include the power draw of everything needed to turn the chip on.",Neutral
AMD,We have had x600 vs x600X for like every ryzen generation that has had way more power for minimal performance increase.   Exiting the power sweetspot has been every enthusiasts dream buying the fastest gaming cpu on the market.   PBO being a commonly recommended feature blows past efficiency curve for minimal performance gains.  This is just a slighly better binned cpu. It doesn't feel like 14nm+++ yet.,Positive
AMD,There will almost certainly be some clock speed where it is.,Neutral
AMD,"It's not only that. There is no direct comparison. Someone (anonymous) ran the Geekbench Benchmark and uploaded the results afterwards.  Someone found that result and chose a random result of a regular 9950X3D and used that as a baseline. Both benchmarks were not run on the same system or by the same person. No one knows if these results are in any form comparable or useful.   What we don't know:   \-exact Windows version   \-power limits   \-RAM configuration    \-overclocking yes or no   \-what was the background load? You can run Geekbench while doing something else.   For all Ryzen 9 9950X3D the results differ a lot. The fastest 9950X3D entries are like 30-35% higher than the lowest ones.    The best 9950X3D results are better than the presented 9950X3D.      There is only one logical explanation for this article:   Someone wanted to cash in on the hype for the 9950X3D2 and chose some existing 9950X3D result as a baseline without any explanation.    With all the results, the 9950X3D2 is up to 30% faster or up to 5% slower than the 9950X3D, for any claim between that there would have been results to go with.   But looks like someone thought 7% is positive enough to please the AMD community but also not  so unrealistic that anyone would question the methodology.

AMD,"You got downvoted but that’s very true, Digital Foundry does game benchmarking for CPUs perfect for that reason in my opinion.

AMD,"The 7700K vs 6700K test was GPU-limited, so it not showing any significant differences isn't surprising. Similar for the 9900K test, as the 1080 Ti wasn't fast enough. The 9900K had an almost 10% frequency improvement over the 8700K at stock setttings (4.7 GHz vs 4.3 GHz all-core), with the added L3 cache there's simply no way it would be less than 10% faster.  The 8700K test shows that for CPU loads, the 7700K scored 84.0% while the 6700K was at 77.2%, that's a 9% improvement, the 8700K showed a 19% improvement over the 7700K.

AMD,"Both should be considered, but they should be decoupled when looking at benchmarks. You are right that TCO is important.",Positive
AMD,"Well, it's supposed to have twice the 3d cache too, so that would be where the real gains are. ISO performance in non cache sensitive tasks would have even been fine, but if they want to hyper bin parts to push the performance too for a very premium price, they'll get a couple whales. I'm guessing this will be somewhat low volume as a part.",Neutral
AMD,"I mean no, you can't ignore it, that's how it works.",Neutral
AMD,You just set default to non x3d ccd and pin all games to x3d so that everything running in the background is on the non x3d cores and any non game program that needs more cores will just use both.,Neutral
AMD,"games that do simulation will all want to use combined cache so you dont want them using multiple CCDs. If you got some paralelized simulation software though, yeah it will be good.",Neutral
AMD,This exactly. Games that tend to bottleneck CPUs tend to be relatively easy to run GPU-wise and vice versa. Games that punish both heavily are extremely rare.  Depending on the types of games people play they could experience CPU bottlenecks even at 1440p or even 4K. Bannerlod and X4 I feel are great examples.,Neutral
AMD,"It doesn't really matter either way since after all, the use cases are both extremely unrealistic. What matters is that the test stays consistent between benchmarks.  With benchmarks you're not trying to figure out how many frames a CPU can pump out in a game. What you're trying to figure out is how many it's pumping out vs. other CPUs (i.e. the relative performance). Because of that it doesn't really matter whether all the tested CPUs hover around 100 FPS or 600 FPS.",Negative
AMD,"That was 2 years ago (zen3 itself being almost 6 years old) and only worked out because the 5000 series GPUs only went up to 5700xt, so the naming didn't overlap. The last two generations haven't had an XT (we get 7950x instead of 7900xt).",Neutral
AMD,"When comparing 6700k vs 7700k, GNs benching showed that even synthetics like Cinebench had less than 5% MC uplift at stock and less than 6% uplift in SC. Ashes of Singularity had a 2.7% uplift. They did not compare 6700k vs 7700k OCd.   8700k becomes harder to compare because they changed testing methodology and the OCd 8700k was delidded.",Neutral
AMD,They actually peaked at zen 3 in 2021. The couple of moments when Intel was still on 14nm for the H series before Tiger Lake-H and when the Intel U series was still quad core was when Cezanne looked the most competitive.   But they never managed to fully capitalise on it due to shitty supply and shitty OEM cooperation.,Neutral
AMD,"Exactly! If you're someone frequently running special software that's significantly impacted by a split cache then you shouldn't be buying a CPU that does that.  Thankfully most software just wants more cores, higher clock speed and higher IPC with increases to cache capacity being a *bonus*. Cache being split, not shared across CCD's just doesn't factor in to it for I imagine most consumers.",Negative
AMD,"I think he means can ignore in a sense that the penalty, while still existing, wont impact consumer experience. If the extra latency means ill open my PDF file 5ms later, thats no problem for me. Its only in heavy load software where it really becomes an issue, gaming, enterprise compute, etc.",Neutral
AMD,"You’re right that it doesn’t matter if your benchmarking is purely academic, but figuring out exactly how many frames a CPU can pump out in a game is important if you’re also looking to understand which GPU you should buy.  You still get to compare relative performance as long as you keep the benchmarks consistent like you said, but if you max the CPU then you also get a real FPS number you can compare to GPU reviews to check whether you’ll be CPU or GPU limited at your target res and settings",Neutral
AMD,"Well yeah, except for the Ryzen 5600 XT, which has the exact same number and suffix as the Radeon 5600 XT.",Neutral
AMD,We also had a 5950X. Stop trying to pretend there is any sort of consistency where there is absolutely none.,Negative

AMD,"in the context of this CPU i don't think anyone is worried about opening PDF files or other basic tasks. the main use case of this is people running demanding software that may benefit from the large core count and cache, in which case yeah they're going to care and be doing their research.",Neutral

AMD,RX 5700 here… from 2019… works fine for the kids Roblox and my civ 6,Positive
AMD,"I got a 3080 10 GB FE at MSRP, which still works great and I gave it to my sister. I then got a 4080 Super FE - effectively a $200 discount on a 4080. I am really happy with both the cards.",Positive
AMD,Except I got a $600 launch 9070 XT with nearly the same performance for half the price lol  Makes it hard to be worth it when the value equation aged so poorly,Negative
AMD,*insert Mr bean looking at friend's exam sheet meme* 😂😂,Neutral
AMD,Isn't it man-bites-dog,Neutral
AMD,Wouldn't it be more profitable to launch first and then undercut the price when nVidia launches new cards?,Neutral
AMD,That already exists. 9070 GRE. I think it's like China only or something.,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, which is what they generally do in year 2 launches (RDNA4 launched in 2025 I.e year 1).",Neutral
AMD,Or they could feasibly release a 8GB 9070 GRE with the full bus and 1GB modules. And just market it under the notion that they wanted to release something as cheap as possible with current market conditions.  Would still be a decent e-sports card for a lot of title.,Neutral
AMD,AMD never refreshed their RDNA3 GPU's either.  And there's not a lot to refresh RDNA4 with anyways.  It's just the two GPU's and both already have fully enabled products with higher TDP than necessary.,Negative
AMD,yep just another smear campaign against AMD by the usual suspects,Negative
AMD,RDNA 4 was rumored for Q4 24 and got pushed back - as far as I can tell - to the detriment of nobody. There's far more reason to be delaying this launch than that one as well. I think this news is very predictable.,Negative
AMD,Sitting on a regular 1070 myself.  It's extremely inadequate for modern demanding games.,Negative
AMD,"Get a Arc B580 for  cheap, it will crush your 1070ti",Neutral
AMD,"'another' year? Newer 24GB cards (for local AI etc) cost an arm, leg **and** a liver. 3090 foreva!",Negative
AMD,"Yep, same. DLSS 4.5 ultra performance at 4K helps to extend its longevity in games that are fully path-traced or at least  heavily ray-traced. Luckily, we don't have to worry about any VRAM bottlenecks.",Positive
AMD,Same!,Neutral
AMD,You are ignoring opportunity cost,Neutral
AMD,"The 9070xt came out 3 years after the 4080, bro.",Neutral
AMD,I'll be getting RDNA6 11060xt for more VRAM and half the price and  better everything.  Feel worse yet?,Positive
AMD,"Man-bites-dog would be UDNA launching this year or 2029, as it's a situation outside of the usual. 2 year cadence for radeon arches so far, no launches until 2027-8, it's a dog biting a man, aka the usual.",Neutral
AMD,"> AMD could then undercut  if the cards are selling well... it is unlikely AMD would lower the advertised MSRP, and the retailers / board-OEMs would also prefer not to lower price",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, I checked now. It has less CUs then the normal 9070, I hope it is cheap at the very least",Positive
AMD,"Nah, People will whine because 8GB ""isn't enough"".",Negative
AMD,9070 is aight. 9070 XT though well past sweetspot fs.,Positive
AMD,"If they have overlapping architecture teams, RDNA4 getting pushed back shouldn't make a big difference here.  Dont know why you guys are downvoting that person for simply reporting that 2026 was the initial expected window.",Negative
AMD,"You could get something like 3080 or 4070ti though, are they expensive in your country?",Neutral
AMD,"And you had access to better features all this time too, arguably",Positive
AMD,"Oh, I'm asking because the figure of speech is man bites dog not the other way around. Sounded weird to say it that way when it's not a known phrase.",Neutral
AMD,Sells for about 3600RMB ($500) these days in China.,Neutral
AMD,"For an upper midrange GPU that would likely cost like $450, it's definitely not.",Negative
AMD,Give it another year of AI datacenters vacuuming up RAM and 8GB cards will look fantastic against 4-6GB cards.,Positive
AMD,8GB cards are only bad when Nvidia makes them obviously /s,Negative
AMD,"As someone not well versed in this, would it be feasible to harvest old and dead GPUs for their VRAM and reuse that in modern Data Center cards?",Neutral
AMD,Didn't you get the policy memo?  You now need 64GB of VRAM with 128GB of system RAM to play at 1080p and not be called a filthy casual.,Negative
AMD,"Maybe AMD has learned that giving their teams more time to cook isn't a bad thing. There are no shortage of other reasons why delaying makes sense for this year in particular as well. The world will keep turning whether RDNA 5 comes out in Q4, or 2027.",Neutral
AMD,"Oh I just bought a 5060Ti 16GB a few weeks ago to start a new build.  Not quite 3080 level in average native performance, but more VRAM and better DLSS4 performance which I think will make up the difference.  My CPU/platform is even older though(3570k), so I'm looking at a full rebuild.",Positive
AMD,"The problem is I paid that much money for my Vega FE 16GB 8 years ago and just do not see the point in spending just as much money for the same amount of vram and only like what, double the performance?  I'll just turn the detail down and be happy, stuff still looks good.",Negative
AMD,"To me it wasn't worth the sacrifice of 4GB VRAM even if it was $100 cheaper than the 9070. I got my 9070 for 4199.  I expect stock for it to dwindle though, if the 9070 gets cuts the GRE probably would be a even bigger victim",Negative
AMD,Time to get the old RX 580 8GB out of the drawer.  Ten thousand years.,Neutral
AMD,How did you know that I have an AMD-GPU?,Neutral
AMD,"No, they lack the memory density. A card has only a handful of slots for memory chips to go, most cards have the same number of slots.  The increase in memory capacity is by the memory chips going from 512mb to 1gb to 2 gb to 3 gb in capacity each.  If you harvest chips from an 8GB then you're going to only be able to contribute to cards around the same size, not a 48GB or 96GB card.  That's the basic concept.",Neutral
AMD,Silly strawman laced with false dilemma.  8GB is not enough for modern AAA games at 1080P. Which a lot of 'filthy casuals' like to play,Negative
AMD,"Well sure, but if AI wasn't such a party crasher, I think people would definitely care more about this.  Right now, people seem to be in a very ""Who the fuck cares about anything right now?"" state of mind when it comes to future hardware cuz there's so little hope.    Kinda sucks.  Used to be nice to be excited about new hardware releases.",Negative
AMD,"Ahh fair enough thats cool man, hope you enjoy your new gpu!",Positive
AMD,If you're happy with it I support you. But there's options   You can get 7900xtx for less than what you bought Vega FE for. 328% uplift... No redstone features,Positive
AMD,"People cared about the RDNA 4 delay too, until it came out and was a solid lineup. Nobody remembers or cares 6 months after launch. It's not worth complaining about, and especially not right now.  I'm still excited as shit for RDNA 5 - I'm looking forward to seeing what AMD can *really* do with regards to RT performance, and I can't wait to see how low TDP handhelds improve (<15W).",Negative
AMD,"I'm actually super annoyed. lol   I should have done this rebuild six months ago when prices were better, but I was playing a bunch of indie games and didn't feel there was much hurry.",Negative
AMD,"It's different to not complain AFTER something happens, versus like a year beforehand.  Knowing a wait is longer usually sucks.  But people aren't even bothered about it nowadays cuz of extraneous circumstances.",Negative
AMD,"Solid product, nice foundation. Improve ST and intel will comfortably keep their mobile market",Positive
AMD,"I think the ideal would be to get to a point where the flagship ""mainstream"" iGPUs (-H series, for Intel) compete with Nvidia's contemporary x50 GPUs, and then have big iGPU chips (Strix Halo, NVL-AX?) to compete with x60+ level.",Neutral
AMD,"Strix halo is a commercial failure. Too expensive for any meaningful customer to adopt and have real mainstream products.    Intel couldn't care less about that, they just need to be better than 890M and the game is done.",Negative
AMD,I’d love to see its support outside of the approved games demo list. Intel has great hardware but their drivers and game support have always been the biggest question.  What’s the point of hardware if you can’t apply it to what you need.,Neutral
AMD,"If these chips end up cheap enough that they can replace the standard Intel CPU + 50/60 tier mobile Nvidia dGPU it will be very interesting.  I'm not sure they will be able to in the short term, Nvidia pricing on low end mobile dGPUs is very aggressive ($600 5050 laptops are the proof) but hopefully it isn't long before this type of powerful iGPU becomes a common thing.",Positive
AMD,"This is against a 50W TBP RTX 4050 Laptop (which should be more at ease around 90-100W)  Not saying it's bad, but you can't compare Laptop performances without including TDP configuration and behavior.",Neutral
AMD,"""taking on strix halo"" -> result 50% of strix halo performance, ok.",Neutral
AMD,"TWELVE efficiency cores?.... that's nuts.   Anywho, these results look good. Assuming CPU and battery life are comparable or better than Strix Point/Gorgon Point, Intel might have a nice little advantage.",Positive
AMD,Wtf is this article? Strix halo is another class product. Takes on strix halo being more than 50% slower?,Negative
AMD,"I'm sorry but nothing was more embarrassing than that guy from AMD the other day saying it doesn't matter because Strix Halo, a chip in so few devices that's an absolute behemoth, is still faster. Panther Lake is an absolute achievement for Intel. With the right drivers, they're going to have the perfect chip to forgo low end dGPUs.",Positive
AMD,I will need at die fast ultrabook with 12hrs+ battery  Its Not a gaming product,Negative
AMD,Website doesn’t load with adblocker,Negative
AMD,"I'm hoping for a thin and light 16 inch laptop with Panther lake and a B390, as it'll be perfect for photo editing, as Adobe seems to prefer Intel over AMD graphics and a discrete GPU is overkill.",Positive

AMD,I am more interested in next gen desktop APUs,Neutral
AMD,"Compared to my 890M based laptop, the 890M numbers here are about 15-20% lower than what I'm seeing at the same settings.  This is likely due to power targets?  Even if the uplift is just 60% instead of 80%, that's still an impressive achievement for the B390M.  It's a shame that AMD appears to have dropped the iGPU ball in 2026.  Relying on the Strix Halo is not an option here.  It's pretty much impossible to find a good laptops that use it.  The upcoming HX470, and still without FSR4, isn't going to close the apparent large gap.  It seems that AMD forgot to stay hungry and they'll end up losing whatever ground that they'd gained in the last few years.  Mind you, Intel is known to play pressure games with laptop makers too in order to limit AMD adoption, which just makes it even crazier that AMD isn't doing what's required to keep the pressure on.",Negative
AMD,"I think the B390 could be faster than even an RTX 5050 35W (As it could beat an RTX 4050 at 60W).       These thin and light laptops that Panther Lake is built for use way underpowered GPUs. Honestly, it makes sense why the Dell XPS 14 only has the B390 graphics. Before it used an RTX 4050, but it ran at just 30W of power.       Now that Integrated Graphics have beat the -50 Tier of GPUs I don't think we'll even see an RTX 6050 or RX 9050",Positive
AMD,"They've basically maxed out the 128-bit normal socket iGPU now.  For them to beat it they need more memory bandwidth - they can put in a bit more cache, but realistically they'll need a quad channel bus (or maybe they can wait for LPDDR6 at 14.4+).  They can probably have a bit more physical room in the next generation of sockets, but without more bandwidth it isn't *that* useful.",Neutral
AMD,"the 140v also got a 25% speed boost post launch, if something similar happens than this could be as good as a 5060 mobile... which is wild! I hope it dosen't cost as much as halo strix!",Positive
AMD,Needs a conroe vs fx62 moment. It doesn't look promising.,Negative
AMD,Why aren't they comparing the AMD 8060S in the current Strix Halo flagship to the Intel B390? Probably because it doesn't go intel's way... interesting.,Neutral
AMD,And yet maybe 5% of customers will buy this version because its absolutely irrelevant for them whether their laptop would have an Iris iGPU from 2014 or a 2500watt RTX 5090.,Negative
AMD,"Thats great. If you are nvidia making dedicated gpu, then better make something that is not shit. 4050 is a joke",Positive
AMD,"But how much does it cost? It mentions it having 16 cores so I'm guessing it's going to be overpriced if you don't need CPU performance, just like Strix Halo.",Negative
AMD,They need a 25% IPC increase to get back to the leading edge in CPU and honestly i don't see it with their current architecture. They need a new radical design   Edit: getting downvoted for what?. Currently Apple and QC have a very solid lead. Even ARM beats Intel and AMD in general CPU workloads and Intel/AMD have been very slow to update their uarch focusing on clock speed over efficiency and IPC,Negative
AMD,"AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 388 just dropped cheaper than the 395 with the same GPU, it will be cheaper than the panther lake.",Positive
AMD,"Depends on Intel's & amd power targets. I dont think its rly feesible for them to target cpu + gpu power usage, 100W combined at least?",Neutral
AMD,then we wouldnt have the 50 gpus anymore. The XX30 and XX40 GPUs died because of iGPUs competing with them.,Negative
AMD,> Too expensive for any meaningful customer to adopt and have real mainstream products.   So basically every decent APU ever made. Too expensive to the point it bumps into dGPU territory and not powerful enough to be a direct replacement.,Negative
AMD,> Strix halo is a commercial failure. Too expensive for any meaningful customer to adopt and have real mainstream products.  >  >   Story of AMD APUs.,Negative
AMD,"AMD aimed Strix Halo at AI users first and foremost, thinking those folks would pay the high premiums.   But of course anybody serious about AI would have an Nvidia GPU, and so many other AI users are still just using cloud-based services anyways.",Neutral
AMD,"AMD has always had lower supply compared to Intel and yet AMD client continues to grow. Strix Point at launch had little products (Asus being the only OEM per usual) and yet they still continue to grow, at a smaller scale relative to Intel. Strix Halo is still continuing to have designs made, it wouldn't be a 'failure' if we are still getting Strix Halo products at CES...  I wrote a [comment in a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1q7d67m/comment/nyhh23c/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) on the reality of the state of Intel and AMD in the mobile segment. Intel is really dependent on CCG, it is double in revenue to DCAI. They invest in what makes them money. Compared to AMD, client and DCAI is doing well, for client CPUs and GPUs are doing well, putting no pressure in mobile, in fact their strategy has remained the same in the past couple the years and even if marginally their % share is sufficient for them. Intel pushes a lot of supply for mobile, while AMD is smaller, it is all relative in the necessary investments they need to make in order to supply demand. Do I wish AMD stop stagnating in designs, yeah, RDNA3 needs to go, but these companies have motives in what they do.",Neutral
AMD,"We all saw it coming a mile away, when it came out in 2025 it was competing against discounted 4060 laptops as low as just $1000. Too little, too late, too expensive, dated on arrival with RDNA3.5, etc. But for some reason this sub and r / amd always have such a hard on at the concept of a ""big APU"" that in practice would never be economically sensible.",Negative
AMD,Arc 140T is already on par with the 890m for most tasks excluding games.,Neutral
AMD,Commercial failure indeed. Laptop with dGPUs at same price perform better. Laptops with solid CPU perf are much cheaper.,Neutral
AMD,AMD gave Strix Halo zero chance to compete by barely selling any of the lower end models. An 8 core with 32 CUs would be a great mini PC.,Negative
AMD,"I dunno Battlemage was a big step forward on driver compatibility and every month Intel improves all their Arc compatibility. I'd be honestly surprised if Xe3 was worse than their current offerings. I'm sure it still has shortcomings as all Intel GPUs will because they're simply starting fresh, but even my A750 is pretty good right now at playing anything I throw at it.  The only aspect Intel kind of messed up that annoys me is their video encoder, once it gets pegged to 100%, it absolutely tanks your performance on the capture to the point where it skips frames and lags. It never used to do that and the driver also used to include capture software, now they just offload it to people having to download OBS and removed the capture aspect of the driver. Kind of dumb when both NVIDIA and AMD include it as a driver option.",Negative
AMD,Driver support is better than ever and will continue to get better now that Intel has found its footing in the gaming GPU business (yes that includes igpus),Positive
AMD,"If TSMC does raise price on their node, Nvidia doesn't find another node for their lower-end bins and Intel can keep the price on their own node down low, we could see Nvidia simply slowly phasing out the -50 series like they used to do with the MX series.",Neutral
AMD,"The 4050 still has a sizeable memory bandwidth advantage, so it's still very surprising that the B390 comes so close.",Neutral
AMD,"oh damn, this should be a lot higher up! Most laptops have them clocked much higher so expecting 4050mobile performance is kinof a lie...",Negative
AMD,"I get the feeling everybody is still unsure where these PTL chips slot in to and what to compare these against actually. Once we get more info on pricing, power consumption, CPU performance etc. we will get some actually useful comparisons.",Neutral

AMD,It's definitely going to come down to pricing and availability,Neutral
AMD,The new MSI Prestige 16 looks nice.  They all seem to lack Thunderbolt 5 though.,Positive
AMD,"It seems the revived Dell XPS 16 will have the “B390” and no dGPU, as another option. LTT’s video on it said Dell is quoting 27 hours of battery life in “general tasks” and 40 hours of video playback. Obviously remains to be seen how real those manufacturers claims are, but here’s hoping.",Neutral
AMD,"$1100 for a little MSI 13"" laptop with one. there are also quite a few CPU SKUs that have the B390.",Neutral
AMD,"Those 16 cores are 4 performance cores, 8 efficiency cores and 4 “Low Power” efficiency cores. This is only doubling the core count of Lunar Lake, by adding the two plain efficiency core clusters. Or keeping the same core count as ArrowLake mobile’s 285H (not HX!), trading 2 performance cores for 2 “Low Power” efficiency cores.  I’m not 100% on this but I don’t think Stryx Halo used AMD’s C cores, so it basically had an entire 9950x attached to the iGPU.  Prices should be more normal, as this is more part of Intel’s normal lineup.",Neutral
AMD,There's an Ultra 5 chip with the B370 (10 Xe cores instead of the 12). Shouldn't be too costly,Neutral
AMD,It's 16 cores but it's only comparable to Strix Point 12 cores and not Strix Halo.      The highest end Intel chip here only matches the number of P cores in the M5,Neutral
AMD,"I really don't think that is so important for mobile devices though.  All Intel needs to do is be ""good enough"" and the OEMs will use them in flagship models.",Neutral
AMD,I doubt anybody is going unseat Apple from the ST throne in the near future.,Negative
AMD,Well unified core is supposed to be happening in the next couple of gens. Frequencies also seem to have taken a hit on 18A but I'd expect that to improve with time as usual,Neutral
AMD,Not really. They just need to not completely bungle gaming and latency sensitive performance like with Arrow.,Neutral
AMD,"This is about mobile devices, and since a high performing IGPU is included, the question is no longer how well the CPU performs in a system with a 5090 (what most cpu benchmarks focus on) but how well this IGPU/CPU combination performs compared to other IGPU/CPU combinations. I am positive the CPU is not the limiting factor in this IGPU performance tier, so ""leading edge CPU performance"" is not really relevant.",Neutral
AMD,"Don't think it's completely absurd. Should get some efficiencies from less interconnect overhead and lower power memory, so not quite 1:1 with a dGPU. If we were to budget, say, 40W for the iGPU in gaming and 20W for the rest, should be perfectly in line with the higher end laptop SKUs.",Neutral
AMD,Intel Arrow Lake already uses 80W just on the CPU side in multicore,Neutral
AMD,"It would be viable if AMD released their own small PCs with it to cut the MSRP of products, but they aren't interested.",Neutral
AMD,And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Of course we don't know the cost breakdown there as far as PS5 pricing goes.,Neutral
AMD,They just need to make the next iteration cost less. Most of strix halo's issues were the sky high price.,Negative
AMD,"""Local LLM"" is such an incredibly niche thing I can't believe the tech nerd internet is so obsessed over it. Any real life business use case of AI is cloud based no question asked.",Neutral
AMD,well said,Positive
AMD,Too much listening to MLiD who has a boner for APUs,Negative
AMD,"Idk one can easily flip your statement. Panther lake coming in **2026** competing against continuing discounted 4050s prob less than 4060s. I don't dislike Panther Lake nor am I defending Strix Halo, but I wouldn't say your argument is a rather good one.",Neutral

AMD,Nvidia will find another cheap node to use. Samsung will gladly oblige,Positive
AMD,"153 GB/s vs 192 GB/s is not that ""sizeable""  And the comparison against ""HP OmniStudio X 32-c0077ng"" is weird, even in the linked test they have GPU-Z screenshot displaying 1375Mhz memory speed instead of 2000 Mhz on most other RTX 4050 Laptop Review.  I don't understand this comparison against an All-in-One, and I'll wait for more in depth reviews to draw some conclusion.",Negative
AMD,"PC World had power consumption tests under gaming loads. It pulled 60W through USBC with Cyberpunk, so probably 35-40W for the gpu. When they unplugged it, the benchmark numbers stayed the same.

AMD,"The biggest difference between the P and E cores is fMax. The larger the core count becomes, the lower the all core clocks become, the smaller the gap between P and E core performance becomes.   The IPC difference between the two is like ~10%  At a certain point along the wattage curve, given a certain number of cores, there will be a point where E core performance can potentially meet or exceed what you would've gotten has you had too many P cores.    Its also more than just trading 2 P cores for 2 lpE cores. The lpE cores in ARL-H were *so* weak, they were functionally useless. In practice, it'll be more like trading 2 P cores for 4 lpE cores  edit: to be more specific, In ARL-H, below 5W per core, E cores outperform P cores. If you have 16 cores and are running all core workloads, then at 60W, each core is receiving less than 4W.",Neutral
AMD,No it's firmly ahead of strix its right in between. Strix point uses 8 ecores too and it gets demolished in multithread benchmarks as expected,Neutral
AMD,"It affects their margins. The more competitive and better QC is, the less Intel can charge OEMs for their CPUs.     AMD made them lower margins for laptop chips because they weren't very competitive. If they want fat margins, they need to be the best",Neutral

AMD,Chasing above 5Ghz is stupid on laptops. It only matters for desktops,Negative
AMD,You are overly focusing on gaming. I mean general CPU performance,Neutral
AMD,Rtx 5050 is 61% faster than B390. I doubt if they change the wattage configuration and stick to 60W they'll match it. Unless the 5050 is capped to more reasonable wattages like 60-80W. Plus the 60W budget for Intel/amd will be used for other compotents and the apu budget reduces.,Neutral
AMD,"I'm talking out of my knowledge base, but I think the switch from heat pipes to custom vapor chambers means we are less bottlenecked at power density / pulling heat from the chip and more constrained at what the radiator/fan system can push out of the system.",Neutral
AMD,"They announced a first party Strix Halo PC at CES, but it'll probably be really expensive.",Neutral
AMD,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all.

AMD,Gaming still makes Nvidia well over 10 billion a year. Is going to hit 15 billion+ this fiscal year.  They dominate the market and its their mass market product reaching million  Of course care about gaming a lot,Positive

AMD,Because there is no pricing power from competition to make it lower prices. AMD would have to sell at a loss to make its GPUs more enticing. And force Nvidia to lower prices. But they are not willing to do that against the company 10 times the size.  A CEO of a company has a fiduciary duty to maximize shareholder return. So Nvidia (or AMD) will charge as much as they can.,Negative
AMD,"exactly, why nvidia isnt cheaper",Negative
AMD,"Nvidia as a company has a dual commitment. That to their executives to make money, and that of excellence to deliver a product and achieve market goals.   Taking a hit to margins means keeping your customers happy and keep them buying Nvidia.  Because any customer that chooses AMD this generation, is one that’s likely to stay AMD next generation. So it’s lost future revenue as well.   Marketshare isn’t this measure of who’s winning for a particular generation. It has tremendous “stickiness” and momentum where any competitor would have to have the better product for multiple generations in order to even get minority of the market.   That’s why you’ll notice Intel taking huge margin hits to keep their market share in server and OEM. Because once those customers switch to AMD, you’re going to have to offer them a much better deal to get them to switch back.   And it’s why AMD Epyc still isn’t majority market in server, because of the market momentum, and Intel taking margin hits to prevent it.",Neutral

AMD,"Even if Nvidia goes Semi Custom next gen is locked for AMD. If Nvidia goes Semi Custom it still won't happen. Plus, it's just easier and cheaper to make an APU exclusively from AMD because they're hands down the best when it comes to APUs. It's be a pain to get Intel and Nvidia to work well on a single chip at least until we see the fruits of their recent partnerships. With FSR4 basically being confirmed for Sony consoles there's just no incentive to go with Nvidia. Ray Tracing is gonna improve by bounds next generation either way for them and FSR4 is good enough for 4K. Nvidia wont accept less money than AMD either. AMD actually has fairly small profit margin on consoles and Nvidia doesn't have anything less than large margins in their devices.  I would also mention that unlike pre built companies Sony doesn't care about Nvidias brand.

AMD,"Because AMD priced away the bulk of their margin, and can't afford to absorb higher memory costs.",Negative
AMD,PS6 would mark the 3rd successive generation of AMD products in Sony consoles (and I believe the 4th for Xbox). Intel hasn't ever made something like Strix Halo. Console APUs are an entirely different beast to regular ones. Intel has to have something like Strix Halo to show it can truly compete.   Companies won't trade away years of partnership just because another company has good products now. Intel might genuinely have to take a loss to get APU contracts. AMD has also never had an issue supplying the volume Xbox and PS need. They're ridiculously efficient with those chips so Intel's foundry services aren't as big a selling point unless they undercut costs pretty substantially.  I'd be very surprised if Xbox or Sony went with Intel unless AMD completely drops the ball.,Neutral
AMD,"I agree with you but i would like to point out not every sale is that. Many sales are getting rid of old inventory because storage space is limited and you want to bring in new, more profitable items in.",Neutral
AMD,"Intels Panther lake is very close to Strix halo when it comes to performance while being cheaper/smaller chip and having superior upscaling and frame gen technology (obviously both of them get clapped by Apple in raw perf) but when it somes to consoles what matter is price for a performance, which Intel will be able to edge AMD as intel has their own fabs.",Positive
AMD,"Panther Lake isn't close at all. It's about half the performance. It's much faster than their other igpus but Strix Halo is in another tier. Intel compares their igpu to a power limited laptop 4050 (and they lose still by like 10% iirc). AMDs Halo is compared to desktop 4060 in quite a few cases. That's a huge difference.  Yes, Panther Lake is a great igpu. It's not close at all in raw performance. It's got more advanced technology for sure and its RT performance is very impressive for what it is. But it's also a much newer architecture and it's lucky for them that they are in a transition period for AMD where AMD is unable to put their latest architecture in mobile chips.  Intel's fabs have lost them money. I'm not sure they're gonna bring better value for money. AMDs architecture is just better and they can use less advanced nodes if they so wish. Hell, if they're really desperate they'll go to Samsung and give them a big order. Samsung would gladly discount chips to dirt cheap levels for a major customer.",Positive

AMD,"There are two separate arguments listed in this article:  1. It only works for well-conditioned problems 2. It only does DGEMM which is a small part of scientific computing  The first one is not really warranted. Sure, if you can do with e.g. the equivalent of ""55 bit"" precision you get even more of a performance jump, but you can still emulate at *strictly higher* than 64 bit precision on the latest NV HW and get out ahead of their native FP64 performance. You won't get the exact *same* result, but it would be strange for an algorithm to rely on that rather than the numerical accuracy of it.  The second concern is far more relevant. While DGEMM emulation can be done in a self-contained way, there's not really any production-ready equivalent of that out there for all the other math that a HPC algorithm will likely be doing.",Negative

AMD,"That's not the full story. Nvidia claims FP64 performance doesn't need to improve with each generation, because they claim that the Ozaki scheme can exploit the ever increasing number of low-precision tensor cores and make up for the lost performance.  But AMD argues that the Ozaki scheme is only for matrix multiplication, and that many of the HPC applications they have studied don't make heavy enough use of it to result in a net performance gain with emulated FP64.  There's a whole section in the article about the applicability of the Ozaki scheme:  > Even if Nvidia can overcome the potential pitfalls of FP64 emulation, it doesn't change the fact that the method is only useful for a subset of HPC applications that rely on dense general matrix multiply (DGEMM) operations. > > According to Malaya, for somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of HPC workloads, emulation offers little to no benefit.  > > ""In our analysis the vast majority of real HPC workloads rely on vector FMA, not DGEMM,"" he said. ""I wouldn't say it's a tiny fraction of the market, but it's actually a niche piece."" > > For vector-heavy workloads, like computational fluid dynamics, Nvidia's Rubin GPUs are forced to run on the slower FP64 vector accelerators in the chip's CUDA cores.  These facts don't change just because emulated FP64 becomes IEEE-compliant. AMD states that they are presently studying **if** making FP64 emulation complaint can make the Ozaki scheme usable for more applications.

This also means that, at least in the west, the US government effectively makes the market with its orders.

AMD,"Well, you got a point, I phrased that badly.   No, HPL is a politically motivated benchmark with zero applicability in the real world that causes real harm to the HPC world and is horrendously expensive to run.    If you're interested in this, here is a slightly longer explanation (It's a slightly modified copy paste from a different explanation from me, so some things might seem a bit off to you)  It was created to ""prove"" performance claims by manufactures. Back in the day even CPUs had a claimed theoretical max performance, usually in GFLOPS. But what does it even mean and where does this number come from? It tells you how many floating point operations (typically 64 bit) a processor can theoretically do. It's calculated by core count \* clockspeed \* fp operations per cycle. So, it tells you how many operations the CPU can do if every single clock cycle was used to calculate as many operations as theoretically possible per cycle. For modern CPUs, lets use a 7950X as an example: It has 16 cores, runs at a base frequency of 4.5GHz, has two 256 vector ALUs and supports FMA (fused multiply add, performs two operations in one cycle), so it's two operations per cycle on 8 (2x 256bit = 8x 64bit) FP per core on 16 cores 4.5G times per second. So 4.5 x 16 x 8 x 2 = 1152GFLOPS. The same math applies to GPUs where the performance claim is usually still marketed.   HPL is a benchmark that was created to get as close as possible to this number. It's designed to minimize overhead, memory, networking etc, and use 100% speedup from wider vector units etc. And not only that, every single manufacturer has their own optimized HPL version. On intel CPUs you run an intel optimized version on AMD an AMD optimized version etc. To get back to the example, [here](https://wp-cdn.pugetsystems.com/2022/08/hpl-zen4.png) is a test from puget systems with a result of 1011GFLOPS which means a \~87% efficiency.    And that's basically the thing, the more time you spend optimizing, the closer you get to the optimum which is about 85-95% of theoretical maximum. And not only that, if you spend enough time optimizing and distributing load, you can even throw in a GPU and add the performance to the total performance. It's essentially just about how much time you're willing to invest into it.   The problem is, none of that translates into any real world performance. This [chart](https://www.pugetsystems.com/pic_disp.php?id=68180) shows how random many results seem to be (intel dominates there because of their early AVX 512 adoption). In the real world, especially in HPC the software is far more complex and more I/O, network and memory dependent than pure compute bound.    There isn't a single common HPC workload that scales with performance as HPL does, none.   The benchmark exists for the top500 list and to ""validate"" the performance claims. It's for politics, to be able to say ""our supercomputer is faster than yours"".",Negative
AMD,> Blackwell offers ~37TFLOPS in native FP64 and up to >200TFLOPS in some scenarios with emulated FP64.  Only when doing matrix x matrix multiplication. Matrix x vector or anything else would fall back to native.    It all depends on the needs of the customer 🤷‍♂️,Neutral

AMD,"(2/2 I hit the comment length limit)  And that's where the problem starts. I did work at a super computer place at a time where they were looking for a new system. Because most scientific super computers are paid by the state/city/whatever and it's a political thing, HPL is a real problem because politicians want to see results and they only care about HPL and where it lands in the top 500 list.   Thing is that running HPL is horrendously expensive. If you want good results you can easily spend like 2-4 weeks on optimizing and benchmarking, which doesn't sound too bad until you realize that if a supercomputer is used for 5 years, that's 1-2% of the whole lifetime and therefore cost.   Next problem is that GPUs are still not that great in HPC and a lot still runs on CPUs for many different reasons. The place I worked at had zero uses for GPUs as their main software had no GPU support. They had some, mostly for analyzing results (and visualization) that was purely built on CUDA. But GPUs offer like 10x the performance in HPL compared to a CPU socket and are far more cost effective.   But money came from politics and they didn't want a rather small uplift (plans were to spend a lot on networking and storage) and therefore they had to buy some GPU racks and spend less on storage and CPU nodes. And because AMD GPUs were faster at that time in HPL, there was pressure to buy AMD GPUs (which they didn't but they bought a lot of nvidia GPUs).   I can't speak for all supercomputers but at least to me it's not surpring how much more successful AMD is with their datacenter GPUs in the Top500 list (which AMD likes to say for marketing reasons).   Just makes it a bit funny when AMDs only example for the need for native FP64 performance is HPL. I have an idea why.",Negative

AMD,"IBM is coming up with their new POWER11, but I don't think there are any major supercomputers planned around it.",Neutral
AMD,Ozaki scheme gives exactly the same precison and results as native fp64.,Neutral
AMD,"SSE/AVX are handled by FP64 SIMD ALUs.  However, modern X86/ARM/POWER uarchs have superscalar FPUs, so they can dispatch multiple extended precision (80+ bit) FP ops per cycle as well for non data-parallel code paths.  Some uarchs also support fused 64bit FPUs, so they can issue 2 FP64 per cycle, or a single 128bit quadruple precision float.",Neutral
AMD,"Like I said, incredibly badly written",Negative
AMD,"I think you're confused as to what my position on emulated FP64 is. I'm supportive of hardware support for FP64. I'm quite troubled by the direction that NVIDIA is going towards (stagnant or retrograde FP64 performance with each successive generation; and its reliance on the Ozaki scheme as its approach for improving FP64 performance).  >> ""We should, as a community, build a basket of apps to look at. I think that's the way to progress here."" > > Progress. Not rejection, not stagnation, not moving backwards.  The progress that is being referred to here is a call to for more research into the applicability of emulated FP64, not progress in its deployment, given that it is still a known unknown as to whether emulated FP64 is sufficiently applicable as to justify displacement of hardware FP64 or not.

As I've said before, the issue of IEEE compliance cannot change the fact that many HPC applications do not use DGEMM.",Neutral
AMD,thanks for the information,Positive
AMD,"You missed the earlier (a couple of months ago) rumor that Nvidia would drop native FP64 support starting with R100 or whatever it will be called.  Something like the old H100 of course is just fine, but AMD isn't referring to currently available GPUs here.",Neutral
AMD,"Like I said the Ozaki scheme is only for DGEMM. If they need FP64 for other things then maybe native is the way to go. AMD is offering MI430X with enhanced FP64, and the low-precision focused MI450X.  And customers are buying both.  And the emulation isn't an Nvidia only thing. It can be implemented on AMD GPUs if required.    Customers have lots of options.",Neutral
AMD,"Nowhere do they say there is no point to it, in fact they say they are exploring it.",Neutral
AMD,"That's not the point. The point is that fp64, which is required for HPC, is now slower because it's no longer natively hardware accelerated.",Negative

AMD,Same die. I kind of assumed xt would always be prioritized and the non xt are just poorly binned ones,Negative

AMD,"From what I heard the XT has a higher chance for coil whine, which is one of the reasons I went for the non-XT version.",Neutral
AMD,"Apparently, the XT die yield are so good that there's barely any non XT.",Positive
AMD,Likely has more to do with prioritizing vram supply.,Neutral
AMD,"It's quite common to cut down perfectly good dies in order to produce more of the lower priced SKU, because usually that's where they sell more units.   This effectively amounts to a price increase of the non-xt relative to the xt",Neutral
AMD,"Base 9070 shows up on the Steam survey, the XT doesn't for what it's worth.",Neutral
AMD,Is it possible they can increase yields by slowing production?   Otherwise I think it’s just them artificially cutting down chips based on demand.,Neutral
AMD,"There was a short while here now in EU at the end of 2025 where the 9070 had good availability. And the price difference vs the XT was holding at a similar level as the performance delta or even better. Which made the 9070 a decent deal, since you can gain a lot of performance from OC/power modding.  But now they are back to ""9070 XT minus 50-75 euro"" at best",Positive
AMD,If you think Nvidia thinks DLSS 4.5 will somehow make people buy GPUs they wouldn't want to purchase otherwise you're high. It's legit just an upgrade to the already great transformer upscaling and more frame gen options.  If AMD wanted people to buy GPUs they would focus on prebuilts and laptops.,Neutral
AMD,"Bruh what? That’s the craziest thing I’ve read so far.  DLSS 4.5 hype is most likely not a botting conspiracy because NVIDIA is trying to ward negative sentiment, and more likely due to there being a larger market of people who can test the thing out for free.  Again, need I mention that NVDIA has most likely sold more 50 series cards than AMD has sold 90 series cards? Not to mention that DLSS 4.5 still runs optimally on 40 series cards, and runs at all on 20 and 30 series cards.   This wide coverage of people getting a free upgrade will naturally generate hype.  As for the 9070 XT being the best bang for buck once the 5070 Ti is shitcanned, this will be true, though sadly not as good of a bang of a buck before the whole VRAM apocalypse went down.",Neutral
AMD,"I bought a Gigabyte Windforce OC 5070ti for $750 about three weeks ago. The cheapest I can find it in stock right now is $1300.  With Nvidia saying they're going to de-prioritize the 5060ti 16GB, if AMD can keep the 9060xt 16GB and 9070xt in stock at somewhat reasonable prices then they have the best 1080p and 1440p option.",Neutral
AMD,> GPU tribalism. Wild shit.  Says the fella deluding himself into believing conspiracy theories that don't make any sense.,Negative
AMD,Pretty sure that's just the higher board power pushing the VRM harder. Should be similar if you just power limit the XT to non-XT levels.,Neutral
AMD,Shades of the old Phenom II dual-core CPUs that had four fully functional cores that could be unlocked on certain motherboards.,Neutral
AMD,Also makes sense to push for higher margin since they have the same VRAM capacity,Neutral
AMD,My assumption is that it's a low stock product so they aren't going to sell them for now while they build up supply.,Neutral
AMD,"Thats a given, but both can be true that AMD may also no longer have enough stock to justify the sku.",Neutral
AMD,"That's dumb, both cards have the same exact memory, so making a non-XT shouldn't have any effect on the XT from a VRAM standpoint. Spork is likely correct about high yields leading to low supply of defective dies. AMD really optimized the frick out of that N48 die.",Negative
AMD,The steam survey is hardly scientific and can wildly swing between surveys. You have to look at the long term trends to get a good picture which GPU’s are popular with consumers.,Neutral
AMD,"No, as far as I'm aware it's not possible. The likely answer here is that they do not have that many defective chips anyway so they're prioritising the SKU that is sold for more (same chip).",Negative
AMD,"My understanding is that TSMC wafers tend to be batched - switching to new masks takes time and cost more than making everything in one go and keeping dies in a warehouse which are then binned, packaged and put on cards to sell.  There's a decent chance that the silicon has already been produced, and has for some time. They can't do anything to change their quality.",Negative

AMD,"Ah yes direct data from steam with massive install base of primary GPU consumers is not scientific, but r/radeon wild ramblings are facts. Do you believe that earth is flat too?",Neutral
AMD,And TSMC N4P has excellent yields.,Positive
AMD,Something like that. They can just use 9070 firmware on a 9070xt chip instead of physically disabling stuff on the chip. It certainly would not be the first time lol.   Imagine it being the opposite of the situation when nvidia couldn't keep 3090s on the shelf. They were probably selling the worst possible qualifying chip as a 3090 to maximize profits. So if you got a 3080 it was probably the worst of the worst lol.   This case would be the opposite if demand for the 9070xt was so weak (compared to 9070 sales) that they started selling the good chips as 9070s to move them. You're more likely to get a really good 9070 chip that might even work as a 9070xt with the right firmware lol.,Neutral

AMD,"There were at least reports in past months with from people with screenshots with 9070XT's of it showing up on the hardware survey as ""AMD Radeon Graphics"" the same it shows for APU/iGPU graphics.  I don't doubt in my mind both GPUs got outsold by the 5070 and 5070ti but I also have seen that's hard to get actual numbers from Steam so we don't know. But I imagine some percent of that 2+% of ""AMD Radeon Graphics"" are 9070XTs, I'm pretty sure they sold more than 0 9070XTs.  Reminder when the RX480/RX580 were priced against like 2GB 60 series Nvidia GPUs while having 4 times the VRAM and nearly double the performance for the same money they still got outsold like 5 to 1 by the Nvidia GPUs. And this is a pre-RT and upscaling era so none of the bells and whistles/software suite type features would be a reason either. So even in situations where an AMD card is just flat out better in every way, it still usually gets outsold hand over fist, so in situations where it's debatable or worse it's an even wider margin.",Neutral

Had to disassemble everything to get to that piece and bend it straight. During the process i noticed that one of the heatsink screws for the VRM had snapped off.

It won't be as quick for AMD in relative terms to root-cause this issue like Intel did with theirs.  So in the meantime they're happy to RMA dead CPUs quietly.",Negative

It's extremely weird that we keep seeing motherboard vendors getting blamed for killing AMDs x3D chips all the time, it's almost as if the x3D chips are the problem themselves and AMD is just forcing their partners to shift the blame around so there isn't a massive decrease in sales.

I think the ASRock community just picked up on it first and started documenting it first.  Gamers Nexus and Wendell from Level 1 Techs have both been trying to get some insight and they can't replicate or make an ASRock board kill a CPU, and they've even been using boards that have had CPUs die in them before.  It does seem to be some sort of manufacturing issue, but Intel's one was pretty much 100% of specific models of CPUs were affected by this issue and would eventually fail.  AMD's issue doesn't seem to be this. I think it just looks a lot more common than it is because of how many CPUs AMD is selling now.",Negative

AMD,*knock on wood*,Neutral
AMD,"This is stupid. If you already bought it, use it. Otherwise you are burning through any potential warranty period by just letting it sit and collect dust.",Negative
AMD,They have the lowest failure rate of the 4 big manufacturers. ASUS just has an elevated report rate because they have the most sales out of all the vendors by far.,Neutral
AMD,"Just dont touch scalar, that can really mess up your cpu.",Negative
AMD,"I tried PBO on my 9800x3d, but I couldn’t get it stable at all. It just wasn’t worth the risk, especially now with how expensive everything is getting.",Negative
AMD,> Went to sleep and never woke up.    You just need a prince to kiss it!,Neutral
AMD,Tweaking it's fun but it feels like they are maxing out the silicon from the factory.  Enjoy your new chip,Positive
AMD,I thought you were talking about never waking up and not the chip,Neutral
AMD,"I've used PBO to set the thermal limit to 90C, at least that option is buried under the PBO menu. Also limited VSOC to 1.2v. No idea if any of this is a risk, although its meant to reduce spikes, power draw and noise.",Neutral
AMD,I feel like my 5800x3D has degradation on the memory controller as well. Launch unit so among the oldest out there but still,Negative
AMD,"Yup - restarting, waking from sleep, or even turning on after a couple of days being off - all these actions seem to be the moment the affected users reported failure.",Negative
AMD,"Unlike the Raptor Lake issue, this X3D issue manifests as a CPU at 100% working and then 100% dead. If you're getting inconsistent crashes or wonky behavior, it's most likely RAM.",Negative
AMD,As someone who just bought a 9800x3d and a gigabyte mainboard I now feel a little bit concerned.,Negative
AMD,What issue you have?,Neutral
AMD,"Yea, they said AMD failure rate was higher even on top of Intel drama - iirc",Neutral
AMD,"I've been on a x870e Nova for about a year at this point. If I was one of what looked like a set of fishy batches, she'd have died by now I'd think.",Negative
AMD,I'm still leaning towards it being because ASRock had the most compelling lineup this time around. A lot more enthusiasts having their mobos means more posts with traction with their boards when there's a failure,Positive
AMD,"It's also seeming to be associated more with some batch numbers then others last I checked, which to be fair was a while. My guess is that this is a 'quietly replace dodgy chips as reported, dissect failed MCMs as they arrive, quietly revise Zen 6 with whatever they find if it's a design rather then batch issue'.",Neutral
AMD,Me too. I built my most recent rig in late February / early March of 2025. So the CPU I got was fairly close to their release date. I have my 9800X3D in a X870 Steel Legend WiFi at the moment and it has been flawless so far. I did buy a X870E Taichi as well on sale to upgrade but have not swapped them out just yet due to all this. Not sure if waiting is really going to make things better or not. I should be getting my 5090 in a few weeks. I will make my decision to swap the boards out at that time.,Positive
AMD,"The affected userbase seems to be small. I personally own a 9800x3d in an Asrock board and had no issues so far. Latest bios, pbo ON set to tjmax=85C. Many other systems running fine.had the system for more than a year now",Neutral
AMD,"388H is 8% faster 1T and 0.1% slower MT than 395 Max at equal TDP, that's ""making AMD irrelevant""?",Neutral

AMD,"I’m curious about where you managed to get reliable data with failure rates by motherboard manufacturer considering nobody has access to that, probably not even AMD.",Negative
AMD,"I think whatever happened to DLVR for Raptor Lake can be fairly considered a defect in that silicon, and disabling it late in the development cycle likely had something to do with Intel's other voltage regulation mistakes.",Negative
AMD,"I mean, some 13th gen cpus were actually literally defective and it was known.",Negative
AMD,"Mine is getting delivered tomorrow so i really feel you haha, upside is we likely both have a warrenty should something happen.",Positive
AMD,Out of curiosity did you have PBO active?,Neutral
AMD,What was AMD’s response?,Neutral
AMD,"Well, yes, it would be much better if AMD could just tell us what's going on.",Neutral
AMD,"Valid points. So many instances were just bent pins or a bad install, some of the most vocal people on reddit in the end had bent pins. Even in the above article there were more bent pins discovered by one user which rather invalidates that result.  It didn't help motherboard vendors were using some crazy high voltages for the first year of AM5, and I don't just mean the VSOC either. But that shouldn't be a factor with current chips and 99% of new builds because anyone using a 2022/23 dated UEFI would be having enough memory headaches to have updated by now I'd hope.  It's just annoying how this problem won't go away, if it was just \~5 reports I wouldn't give it any thought. But then something utterly random like that cafe owner using ASUS boards having a 10% failure rate on 9800X3D systems makes the news. It's always just enough to make me wonder. I use an ASRock board with a 7700X and I still swear it's the best computer I've built since 2006 with the Core 2 Duo E6300. And I've built many Intel rigs since then and now. These questions are not enough to put me off my planned Zen 6 X3D upgrade but I will not be happy if this keeps going on with whatever the next-gen X3D part will be called.",Negative

AMD,They should,Neutral
AMD,I purchased mine in July. It was solid until October/November.,Positive

AMD,I do have an older bios version so maybe its fine,Neutral
AMD,Yep. I just tinked with the per core CO and left everything else well alone.,Neutral
AMD,"On the Asrock Reddit loads of people have said it started with long boot times, inconsistent booting etc so your statement isn’t necessarily true.",Negative
AMD,"Not neccessarily - my two dead Raptor Lake CPU's worked fine unless you put on a load on them. Then i started getting internal compiler errors, memory corruption and random freezes. CPU replacement fixed this, then second CPU died, now same memory lives happily in an AMD CPU.",Negative
AMD,I tested my ram with memtest86 though.,Neutral
AMD,"As someone with the same combination, I'm not worried.   I bought a Gigabyte board because they had the least reports of 9800x3D killings. Even Techyescity's video showed that Gigabyte had the most conservative voltages, which may or may not be the reason they die.  Seeing them being conservative with Bios updates makes me confident in them as well, MSI and Asus have released Bios updates (Agesa 1.2.0.3E) too soon, with lots of issues, meanwhile Gigabyte is more slow and stable this generation it seems. However some of their bios settings were in Spanish for a while which seemed a bit incompetent lol",Neutral
AMD,"Asrock also had the least problems on AM4. Few of the boards had the usb dropout issue, they lasted well and had big enough bios chips that they were about to be the only partner that was going to keep all of the AM4 CPUs working on x570 and b550 until AMD backtracked  And I followed sales in my country closely for the first few months of AM5 and Asrock always had a minimum of 4 boards in the top 10",Positive
AMD,"It's rare that one marque was that overwhelmingly good a spin, from the Steel Legends being the best value option up to what had a good claim to be the best bang for buck x870e, the Nova. So yeah...",Positive
AMD,Are you saying it works on your machine?,Neutral
AMD,"Oh man, so it's gonna be essentially the same performance about a quarter of the price… Goddamnit it signed me up  This is what you don't seem to understand, the 395 needs like 150 W to get its peak performance, and it's being sold in systems that cost $2000-$3000. And doesn't come with upgradeable memory either.  The Panther Lake stuff is offering the same performance, it's gonna have access to XESS in gaming, which is massively better than FSR three, and it's also gonna cost a fraction of the price  😅. Not gonna lie, I love how your poster ended up, coming out as a straight up advertisement for panther Lake",Negative
AMD,"a poorly written microcode does nos mean defective chips. 13 and 14 gen i7 and i9 problems came from poorly written microcode that requested wrong voltages from motherboard did it not? You implied that problems were due to defective batch, which they didn't.",Negative
AMD,They only confirmed the chip was authentic. They couldn’t read the QR code either,Neutral
AMD,"So, tell us based on 5 claimed CPU's ? Out of how many. There is no fucking way any company could survive, if they started commenting on every possible reddit thread of dead component or product.  Intel did coverup for YEARS on massive number of dying CPU's. Thats a problem you need to adress. Or if you have certain mobo maker burning up (and i mean literally) CPU's, kinda like asrock.  This ""reporting"" was so poorly done, no actual linking things, other than ""asus board"" and ""x3d"". Didnt even bother to find out if they had any link in bios revisions, microcode etc. I found couple threads of dead CPU's (was that even confirmed on all?), ill just write a story pointing fingers at Asus, not AMD im guessing.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, but I guess the independent media outcry isn't loud enough, and AMD appears to be on the road to sitting it out in the hope everybody just forgets about it.",Negative
AMD,"Yes. I bought a new 9950x3D, RMA'd the faulty one, received a replacement, and returned the new one I bought. What a rollercoaster.",Neutral
AMD,"Untrue. VRchat has absurd benefits from 3D cache. [https://github.com/Greendayle/VRChat-benchmark-cache](https://github.com/Greendayle/VRChat-benchmark-cache)  So does Risk of Rain 2. I'll be doing my own benchmark numbers soon, but I can only compare 5800X vs 9800X3D since that's all I have.",Positive
AMD,Isn't that usually worse?,Negative
AMD,Just the sheer size of the pool of people that have OC memory profiles causing random issues is bound to overlap with dead CPU issues.   On the Raptor Lake degradation problem it was particularly problematic because memory instability and core degradation symptoms had a large overlap. People would swap in a new CPU with new microcode and still crash in UE5 games every 1-2 weeks from unstable XMP profiles but never think it could be the memory.,Negative

AMD,"My x470 taichi was a champ, there was a reason I found it so unsurprising that the 800 series lineup from them was also top notch.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah.   To me it feels a bit like the 12VHPWR connector issue on the 4090. Reddit was full of users posting pictures of their burnt connectors, yet NVIDIA’s investigation revealed that only a small portion of users were affected.   Likewise, 9800x3D burning is a real thing, but so far no one has been able to pinpoint a cause. Even re-using the same mobo that killed a previous CPU is not enough to replicate the issue.   Taking into consideration the popularity of this CPU and the fact that it sells well, if it was a widespread issue we would have heard many reports of failures. For reference, on Amazon’s product page it says “1K+ bought in the last month” in UK. And that s only 1 site in 1 region.",Negative
AMD,"Works on mine too. I'm running a 9800x3d on an AsRock b850 board and have had no issues so far that I'm aware of. Running with latest bios, pbo2 on, etc, etc. Had my system going for quite awhile now.  Only real quirk is that I'm running a wifi board that can only use a bios from the non wifi version. Oh well...",Positive
AMD,">in gaming  lol, lmao even.  do you understand that dGPU-less laptops are only bought for gaming by people with no money, therefore they are completely irrelevant as a market force?  Professionals buy iGPU-only laptops for work.  Gamers buy laptops with dGPU for gamers.",Negative
AMD,You bring these ‘statistics’ as fact when it’s you scrolling forums and making assumptions? Bold move.,Negative
AMD,No I didn't. You just don't know what I'm referring to.  I am talking about a specific batch of only 13th gen chips that experienced an oxidation issue that was separate to the voltage and microcode issues.  Hence the word 'some' and no mention of 14th gen. I would suggest reading words and then thinking about them before replying next time.,Negative

AMD,">To me it feels a bit like the 12VHPWR connector issue on the 4090. Reddit was full of users posting pictures of their burnt connectors, yet NVIDIA’s investigation revealed that only a small portion of users were affected.  Yet over tens of thousands of people still got burned by it, the number of 12VHPWR burnt cards steadily going through repair shops is mind boggling because they often will have the warranty denied. It was even mentioned in the recent Brother Zhang repair shop video. Having to treat the cable as if it was made of paper because it can't be bent, or angled, or tugged on, or pulled because it messes up the pin alignment is a joke. People that ran 4090's for years without problem do a board swap, or a rebuild, or just carry the thing outside to dust it and the cable isn't positioned straight when they lock the side panel closed and it's all over for their GPU. It's an inexcusable design when a slight bend in the cable can disrupt pin connections in a way to cause the entire connector to fail. People could abuse the hell out of PCIe 6pin and 8pin cables, even bend them at 180 degrees to hide them and it was safe to do so.   At least when AMD's CPUs die mysterious deaths AMD is graciously and expediently warrantying them. But you'd have to buy more than a half-dozen 9800X3Ds to equal the cost of a 5090 today. There was no reason to design the cable with practically no safety margin let alone for a product that now costs more than some people's cars.",Negative
AMD,"Lol do you realize there ARE NO 395 laptops with a dGPU. And the 395 laptops cost a fucking fortune?  You just contradicted your own statement   The panther lake costs WAY less (aka same gaming perf for these ""gamers who have no money"") AND they are paired with dGPUs lol  You completely destroyed yourself in the comments  I'm not sure I've seen someone completely dismantle their own arguments so effortlessly 😅   - panther lake matches the 395 in pro work and gaming. It costs less and ALSO can be paired with a dGPU. It's literally better in every single way 💀",Negative

AMD,"Memtest doesnt stress anything hard enough. I've run several passes on bad ram that finished without errors, then error within seconds on karhu.",Negative
AMD,"It's generally worse at picking up borderline unstable configs, though you can't beat it being bootable directly and having access to all ram in the unlikely scenario there's a specific region that's unstable",Negative
AMD,"We just don't know the total number of failures for either Nvidia GPUs or AMD CPUs. They are higher than normal, but these products have also sold truckloads of them. Even 2% would mean lots of impacted users.  I've not heard of any AIB denying RMA because of the burnt connectors, there might be cases but I am not aware, at least in Europe.  Anecdotally, I have both a 12VHPWR connector (before the revised spec) and a X870/9800X3D system. I took my system apart many times and had no issues whatsoever.  My point is, chances of the person reading this comment being affected by these issues is small, and if you don't want to deal with it, there are plenty of alternatives.",Negative
AMD,I have worked for AMD. Its a terrible company that unlike Intel is not not pushing forward in tech so much. The 395 is such a Halo product which was never meant to be purchased by anyone. Zen5% and eventually Zen6% along with the whatever AMD is launching as the new RDNA while not supporting FSR on them in a year and dropping support for them quickly. Panther Lake is a much superior setup with Intel oneAPI which is straight up better than ROCm. There is so much wrong with AMD and bow that their focus has been with AI that leaves Intel to innovate and give us much better products that AMD has ever. AMD competing with Nvidia has yielded nothing LOL.,Negative
AMD,"Is Karhu the most stringent? I don't mind paying actual people for good software. They know how many times the software is launched each day which is kinda sketchy, but it is what it is. What about OCCT? I've personally experienced MemTest86's inability to find errors despite the memory clearly erroring out in regular usage.",Negative
AMD,Is memtest86 even able to detect infinity fabric errors? I have had overclocks that passed all ram and CPU stress tests and as soon as I added a VRAM stress test I get rounding errors within 10 minutes.  Ryzen is so finicky that you have to bench everything at once (and it was not temp related because I have everything covered by custom loop).,Negative
AMD,"The feedback exists for the GPUs, outlets like GN reported information from AIBs as well as etailers and repair shops each, and all three indicated a significant increase in returns, warranties, and GPUs with burnt connectors in for repair.   The 1.10 factor safety margin on the cable has been calculated to the nth degree by almost every youtube hardware channel.    No alternative exists to the 5090. Even the 4090 now costs more than a 5090, and the 9070 XT doesn't even match a 4080.   I'd love to buy something not from NVIDIA, and absolutely something not using 12VHPWR, but I'm not going to invest in a card that's underpowered for what I need, has too little VRAM, and especially one that has a shorter warranty period. On average I buy a flagship card and then keep it for 6-8 years to get the value back out of it, my last was a 1080 Ti that I would've kept on using except a forced monitor upgrade to 4K was too much for it to handle. So don't get me wrong, I own a 4090 and I treat the thing like it's a glass explosive. I also use an ASRock board for my 7700X and wouldn't even consider swapping it for any other brand. I'll agree the AMD issues seem to be very minimal, but there simply is no excuse for the 12VHPWR thing. As per denied warranties I've read about the occasional one, but I have no idea how prevalent it is. In the Brother Zhang repair shop video Zhang mentions people are sending his shop burnt cards because they were outside warranty or because they were imports (such as from Taiwan) and so they couldn't make use of the warranty that the card had.",Neutral
AMD,"TLDR: If $10 is so much that it puts you off then use the free version of HCI and OCCT. Otherwise yes go pick up Karhu ram test, I definitely think it is more than worth the money.  HCI and Karhu are pretty comparable when it comes to results, though Karhu runs significantly faster and feels like a more finished product. Karhu 2.0 is also coming out pretty soon which looks even better.  I have not tried OCCT for memory testing, though I do use it for GPU and CPU stress testing. I do not like that you basically have to subscribe to their Patreon for $6 per month if you want to run tests longer than an hour, whereas Karhu it is a one time payment of like $10.   HCI's Memtest pro is just a wrapper for the free version of Memtest that runs several instances of it at a time, so really you can do that all manually yourself.   If anyone also has Karhu I would suggest trying out this neat gui expansion for it: https://github.com/jjgraphix/KGuiX",Positive
AMD,"I'm totally cool with paying $10 one time for good software, especially since it's just one guy, from my understanding. I won't use OCCT on principal for going with the subscription model. Sounds like it's best to use a couple different tests, though? Say, Karhu and TM5?",Positive

AMD,"Intel has outright said that the P-core architecture is very similar to what they have in ARL/LNL. Intel has also shown us that the Fmax of PTL is *lower* than ARL-H and on par with Lunar Lake.   ST perf is likely, at best, to be a draw against ARL-H. Uncore improvements might be able to improve PPC marginally, depending on the workload, even if the core architecture couldn't.   nT perf could improve marginally given the stronger core setup (4+8+4 *proper LPEs* is stronger than 6+8+2), but even for that, Intel is claiming only ""on par"" nT perf with the HX370 in Cinebench 2024 and 2026.   Gaming perf with a dGPU is kinda a toss up IMO vs ARL-H. Better mem latency, prob better L3 latency, but smaller L3 capacity, fewer P-cores, and lower boost clocks. I don't think Intel has commented anything about this either.   There's also been a bunch of GB6 leaks that support the idea that there will be no ST uplift vs ARL-H.",Neutral
AMD,Apple dominates the industry in a certain market (low power and single threaded performance) but they certainly aren't hands down the best CPUs in the industry and they've always had certain advantages over their competitors that aren't related directly to how good Apples CPU teams are (node advantage over others + their own OS + soldered memory + designs focusing strictly on efficiency at low power).

AMD,"Apple has pretty good multi threaded chips for laptops too like the M4 Max. Intel is on N3 and Apple laptop CPUs are just better in terms of performance per watt.  Plus we seen M3 and lunar Lake on the same node and M3 CPU is more efficient and faster than the Lion Cove in Lunar Lake. Also soldered memory and node advantage has nothing do with good cpu performance, Panther lake has soldered memory and a better node and yet the M5 CPU is faster because it has a better design.",Positive
AMD,"Yes, they're pretty good but very clearly a few steps below where they sit in single threaded performance.  Intel is also on an architecture that's burdened with Windows (which is a far worse OS in terms of battery life and bloat and which isn't tailored to those CPUs like MacOS is for Apple) and which wasn't targeted for low power usage until just now. Lunar Lake is their first real attempt at that and it's miles closer than any attempt before it. Before this it was basically just the desktop CPU that was fit into a laptop.  M3 was Apples 3rd gen. Again, Lunar Lake was the first for Intel and iirc Apple actually helped make N3 in the first place so they're far more familiar with the nodes when they develop their CPUs. And Lunar Lake is a chiplet design iirc which has some inherent issues with efficiency and means that it's not pure N3 but a mix of more and less efficient nodes.  Having memory on the same SOC and the Node advantage absolutely play a critical role in the performance Apple has achieved per watt. It reduces power consumption and allows much higher bandwidth and reduces some of the logic Apple needs to make.  Also, have we seen the benchmarks for 18A? I'm not sure it's better than N3P. Definitely more at home for Intel though.  Do you have some benchmarks for Panther Lake CPUs? The only ones I've found focus on the igpu.",Neutral
AMD,> Intel is also on an architecture that's burdened with Windows […]  That's really isn't how architectures work … There's actually *Windows on ARM* existing too.,Negative
AMD,"I know. But Intels processors will mostly be used on Windows. Apple couldn't care less about what performance on Windows is like for the M series and people don't expect them to provide great support for that platform like they do Intel. When you tell people that Mac doesn't perform as well on Windows they'll blame you for using Windows in the first place over MacOS because it's basically a package deal.  Intel processors meanwhile need to support a wide range of OSs well and Windows it's most commonly used partner is a resource hog. Zen 4 and 5 processors gained 10% improvement in gaming via Windows updates. How insane do you think that is?  Also very importantly, the people who make the OS are much more disconnected with the people who make the processors for most computers. Windows is inefficient because it's catering to so many different architectures. Arm, X86 and RISC and all the companies that work with them such as AMD and Intel. MacOS only supports Apple products to such a degree. That means there's a lot of optimization tricks it can do for Apples M series that Windows can't for fear of disadvantaging other companies in favour of one.",Neutral

BUT as said amd did sell those cards at higher prices to partners and sellers and what not, but did not rebate the cards, but only a very tiny fraction.  so it was NOT a real msrp, but it was perfectly setup to nicely fool people like you (no offense, the corpos are our enemy and try to lie to everyone possible), so that people like you do not rightfully point out the scam run by evil amd.  so DO NOT let amd the lying scum get away with those lies. THEY setup the fake msrp to lie to the public. the banked on most people not hearing the reporting on what actually is going on and they also banked on people not understanding, that amd is in 100% control of what price cards actually sell at.  so again you are WRONG and i am again correct with this statement:  >if amd would have wanted over 50% of all supply for example to be AT msrp, then it would have been at msrp  also i said 50% here, because that is a reasonable number, as partners of course should be free to still buy the gpu + memory at the same price, but then add value of a better cooler or vrm or other features, to add 20-50 us dollars more at the final price for example, for the higher end models.",Negative

AMD,"Its a 6 years old generation, yes its great for certain scenarios depending on what you already own, or if you can get all parts new for a very low price (not that likely). I hope people aren't buying it just on desperation and FOMO and not taking newer platforms into account. If its a good deal for the performance, then good. However, lower end parts of a new platform could also beat it easily in most scenarios, even if you might have to settle for for example less RAM or cores for now.",Positive

AMD,I think a decent chunk of people are sitting on a system that already has the amount of DDR4 RAM they want but isn't maxed out on CPU power for what Zen 3 can offer.  Tossing something like a 5700/5800X3D into your existing system looks fairly attractive at present for that sort of user if they can bring those back at a reasonable price point. (and those still sell on Ebay *used* for more than their last retail price).  I don't know that there's going to be a ton of people looking to do a full new build AM4 system at this point if they don't already have RAM for it.,Neutral
AMD,"For better or worse, there are plenty of fast DDR4 in the used market, and CXMT has been making DDR4 for a while now and is a source of DDR4 modules that will at least fulfill demand in China, and thus alleviating demand elsewhere even if they don't make it out.  On top of makers now stopping to retire their DDR4 lines due to the shortage, I think that it would at least be better than DDR5.",Positive
AMD,There is a ton of DDR4 on ebay,Neutral
AMD,A lot of used DDR4 knocking about on the secondary market. I personally have 64GB of the stuff and have no interest in moving to DDR5 with current pricing.,Negative
AMD,One that conveys a massive disappointment and fear for the future of hardware.,Negative
AMD,"AMD would need to redesign the memory controller to be compatible with DDR4 and motherboard makers would have to make DDR4 AM5 motherboards. Easy, technically speaking. But then that redesign, tape-out, validation, etc. all takes time and costs lots of money. DDR4 can cost just as much as DDR5 and it doesn't seem like DDR4 supply will go anywhere but down, so this effort would only make sense for the budget-oriented people reusing the RAM they already own. And while the RAM situation is horrible, it's not going to last forever. It may take several years for the situation to ease if things continue the way they are. Or the bubble may pop next week and take memory prices down with it.  So the biggest consideration is money and whether AMD thinks it's worthwhile to spend it chasing a pretty small market that may no longer exist by the time product is available.",Neutral
AMD,"Would make more sense to go the other way around, design new I/O die and then put Zen5 on AM4. The way you said would need new chipset, new motherboards and a new I/O die. Putting it on AM4, in theory all you would need is a new I/O die. You'd still be stuck with DDR4 and PCIe Gen4 and the other platform limitations on AM4/x570/b550/etc, but that's the tradeoff there.",Neutral

AMD,Last year I had 8 sticks of Crucial ddr4 (64gb in total) and sold them all.  Kinda wished I kept onto them.,Neutral
AMD,"I just sold my 5800X3D for $410 cash, b550 board for $90 cash, and 32GB DDR4 for $150 cash  Then I bought the 9800X3D+B650+32GB DDR5 bundle from Microcenter for $730 after taxes  Less than $100 out of pocket.   We're in a small window where it's actually a good time to upgrade if you live near a Microcenter.",Neutral
AMD,"But that's more due to lack of demand and retailers happy to let their stored inventory dwindle as they predict demand will only further reduce. If people actually start buying it again it'll shoot up as new supply would be near nonexistant.  This is more for the last people who are still sitting on an earlier ddr4-based chip (or platform in the Intel case) to reuse that memory and give up on waiting for an entire platform refresh to ddr5.  I'm more surprised they're thinking of this for what is pretty much the x3d boost - as there's still plenty of stock of zen3 parts lacking that, and those prices haven't increased *that* much to suggest they're nearly out of stock.",Negative
AMD,"You can get those for $40 on eBay probably. And they can't even fire up the old factories for that cost. If they said Zen 3, so I'd hope it actually will be.",Neutral

Went from 16GB to 32GB DDR4 3200, and ran an 8GB RX480 up until this year when a close friend gave me their old RX 5700XT.  Currently hoping to upgrade to a cheap 3700X in the next year when finances permit. 5800X3D would be the dream but a 3700X is so affordable and would still be a very nice jump.",Neutral

AMD,"That's a 5800X3D, though. And also, it depends on your area.  If you live somewhere techy, the resale value will be *lower.* Because there's just more of them. (San Jose, CA)  My 5800X3D only went for $300~. No one wanted to give me more than $50 for my X570 board, and RAM hadn't skyrocketed yet. So I just gifted the board/32GB RAM to my SO's brother who was still gaming on a 6th gen Intel and a Radeon 7800XT. He slapped a 5700X3D in it and off he went. The 5700X3D he got for $200 2nd hand.",Neutral

AMD,"Regular Zen3 is still great for gaming, it just gets overshadowed by X3D (for good reason). Hardware Unboxed recently did a comparison of several different Zen3 CPU's.  Also keep in mind many CPU gaming benchmarks are done at 1080p or even 720p with something like a 4090. In reality, for a budget DDR4 build you're more likely to use a much lower tier GPU, while running games at 1440p (1440p monitors are nearly the same price as 1080p these days) so the difference won't be as exaggerated.",Positive
AMD,"That's not a 'big' step up.  That's a pretty mild step up.    Most people dont upgrade their CPU every new generation, and that's basically all this is effectively.  The only real consolation here is that Zen 3 CPU's pass muster in modern games better than Zen 2 CPU's do.  So for that I can understand it, but you're only doing it to get over a line, not because it's actually a big improvement.",Negative
AMD,The irony of AMD's best AM4 gaming CPUs having a single CCD is so thick you could cut it with a knife.,Negative
AMD,"How's the 5900XT feel compared to the 5600X?  I'm still sitting on my 5600X and don't generally need more cores, but would still like a performance boost.

I also wonder about the 5600x (and 7600x/9600x). 6C/12T doesn't seem much but they seem to do well anyway.

AMD,How are your USB ports and wifi/bluetooth?,Neutral
AMD,"First gen was flaky for a number of reasons.  Another is that many people who bought boards for Zen 1 were shit out of luck if they wanted to upgrade to Zen 3.  Zen 1 was also fairly lackluster in terms of single thread performance, and main selling point was really just being able to have a 6 or 8 core CPU at a more affordable overall price point.  Which was great dont get me wrong, but Intel CPU's were still pretty clearly faster in almost all cases at the time for gaming.  Zen 2 was AM4's real arrival in my opinion, helped a lot by Intel stumbling off a cliff at the time.  But if you got in with Zen 2, then your upgrade path was ok, but it wasn't half as miraculous as people make it out to be unless you went for Zen 3 Vcache parts specifically.    AM4 was definitely good and worthwhile, but there's certainly a bit of overselling the narrative here.",Negative
AMD,Right now? AM5. Upgradability is really a blown out or proprtion thing. Less than 1% of ethusiasts (let alone average users) will ever replace a CPU on same platform. By the time people upgrade they will buy a new socket.,Negative

AMD,"Assuming intel also keeps those mobile CPUs a good price, this could be really good. Hopefully as well they add the B390 in their high power desktop CPUs, seeing a core ultra 5 with an iGPU like this would really mitigate the need for a dedicated GPU right away Mostly because iGPUs on other generations were bad, and only a select few Ryzen CPUs had the 890M.

AMD,it has soldered ram ... so it's better then gold!,Positive
AMD,I guess that depends on Intel pricing too. Considering it's using both the latest TSMC and Intel foundries in one chip package. Not to mention the LPDDR5 9600.,Neutral
AMD,You mean OEMs.,Neutral
AMD,No?  People will still value AMD more ue to brand so Intel will have to rely on volume for revenue  For reference only yesterday on this sub we had people talking about Intel lacking efficiency in comparison in mobile space,Neutral
AMD,Crazy AMD haven't updated their iGPU to RDNA 4. I know they're probably waiting for UDNA but it would have been almost 3 years on the same architecture by the time we get the UDNA refresh next year (if they even bring it to their APUs right away). Sort of disappointing.,Negative

AMD,"With everything happening around NVIDIA´s price increases and AMD´s lack of providing updates where it hurts, it **feels like** AI-Datacenters are more important right now for them (like the last 2 years).  But who can resent them as Intel had products that where not so much competitive that time.    Arrow lake (Desktop) at least closed on efficiency, but lacks a bit of gaming performance still, hopefully Nova Lake will be the step required to push more competition.   On GPU the same, AMD does not compete with NVIDIA in higher segments while NVIDIA is fairly comfortable with their setup and increases prices because they want to milk customers to increase their ridiculious margins (up to 70%) that they are used to from AI-Chips.   And now Intel also provides Multi-Frame generation, while a niche for me still, starting to compete with AMD and closes up to NVIDIA in terms of Software support, which they lacked the most and fixes a lot of problems.   Now let them release a B770 that is rumoured to be fairly mid/high range and we can hope for competition that actually learned from bad products recently and tries to make it better.",Neutral
AMD,"Handhelds is a tiny tiny market, basing your product stack around them would be monumentally stupid.",Negative
AMD,"It may not beat LNL in very low power envelopes (LNL was designed for ~10W, PTL for 15W+), but it's a much, much better baseline than what Intel's historically had in client. Even just extending vaguely LNL-tier efficiency across the stack is a very big deal. Looks like Intel finally has a respectable SoC architecture.

AMD,"It's branded as a Battlemage for some reason, but the architecture is Xe3. It's much closer to Celestial than it is to Battlemage.",Neutral
AMD,"Battlemage is the brand name. The actual architecture of Lunar Lake is Xe2, same as desktop Battlemage, but they never explicitly called it Battlemage, only “Arc Graphics”.  What is meant to be desktop Celestial is Xe3P, but desktop Celestial is likely cancelled or significantly scaled back. Alchemist was a massive flop, and by the time the B580 came out to salvage Arc’s reputation the axe had probably already swung.",Neutral

AMD,What do you mean that a refreshed Strix Point can’t compete with an updated architecture?,Neutral
AMD,"I got downvoted everytime I brought this up, but this is precisely why Nvidia wanted a deal to have an Nvidia iGPU tile on an Intel APU: Large iGPUs in thin and lights are going to get good enough over the next few years to make them the new entry-level graphics option for people. This directly threatens Nvidia's consumer laptop volume in the entry segment. Intel is claiming close to 4050 performance at this lower TDP, and that's certainly good enough for many to not have the tradeoffs of having a dGPU in their laptop.  If the new market is moving towards putting GPUs on the CPU package instead of discretely on the board, Nvidia doesn't want to place all of their hopes on WoA becoming better, and are hedging by doing both their own SoC *and* an x86 APU with Intel.  The XPS line dropping Nvidia discrete all together is proof of this. In these sub 70W total laptop power markets, a discrete GPU is just eats into the power budget too much.",Neutral
AMD,"In the ultraportables market (like XPS), integrated graphics just make so much sense (energy envelope; cooling system required; battery life; etc); and that's already substantial and before considering the cost of a NVIDIA mobile dGPU itself.  I don't understand why AMD decided to price Strix Point and Strix Halo so ridiculously -- it's their market for the taking.",Neutral
AMD,I think they’re trying to take away business from Qualcomm/arm on windows before it takes off,Neutral
AMD,Intel charts for their gpus have been pretty on point   Msi claw with lunar lake is one of the best handhelds,Positive
AMD,"Lunar Lake was a expensive product which didn't make sense in handhelds, Intel just didn't have anything else so they slapped that on the MSI Claw. Now the options should be much better considering they are selling a lower core Xe3 version for cheap too",Negative
AMD,"I'm just curious how they handle the need for such high speed RAM on desktop though? I guess this is an application where CAMM2 will be required, I don't think DDR5-9600+ is possible without it and this is presumably pretty key to the performance.",Neutral
AMD,"It certainly would make a huge difference because iGPUs are very memory bandwidth bound; and as the name suggests, LPDDR5 9600 has literally twice the bandwidth of the JEDEC standard 4800.  Unfortunately I doubt we'll see reasonably priced laptops with LPDDR5 9600 -- even as an add-on option. I've been eyeing Dells and Lenovos, and basically all SKUs that previously had 6000 are getting substituted with 4800; and many SKUs that were 2x16GB are now 1x16GB; yes **single channel**.... they charge you extra if you want 2x8GB.",Neutral
AMD,"It has 12 Xe3 cores. Intel doesn't use the term Compute Units, AMD does.",Neutral
AMD,X9 and X7 have 12 Xe cores and the best Ultra 5 has 10 Xe cores,Positive
AMD,??? lunar lake has already shown to be faster than the 890m.  73 percent though seems like a bit much since panther lake was claimed to be around a 50 percent increase over lunar lake,Neutral
AMD,Example?,Neutral
AMD,"They did make a graph specifically to compare the performance of HX 370 and this Arc B390 while they were both using 2x upscaling, which is where this 73% number comes from. In another graph featuring supposedly ""native"" 1080p, they claimed Arc B390 was 82% faster than the HX 370 (why don't they just call it Radeon 890M though...)",Neutral
AMD,"No, intel claims 73% with upscaling (both) and 82% native",Neutral
AMD,"If it was only a 73% gain *including* MFG, then that would be a serious performance regression. If they were using MFG in their graphs, it would easily be 200% - 300% ""faster"" at the same ""real"" performance",Negative
AMD,"The graphs all listed games and I didn't see any synthetic benchmark scores were listed, so yeah.",Neutral
AMD,The relative proportion of the die isn't as important as the die size itself and the node ofc.   Lunar lake for example has an estimated die size smaller than the hx370 so even if they did make the die bigger I don't think that is going to massively raise the price. Not to mention intel owns the foundry unlike AMD who are outsourcing to TSMC. This isn't in the realm of a strix halo competitor with a 300 mm\^2 + die size.   Dell for example has already refreshed the XPS line with intel panther lake and cut out the option for a dedicated gpu.,Neutral
AMD,"There are 50% more GPU cores here than on Lunar or Arrow Lake. CPU is still 16 cores as well compared to Arrow Lake, just shifted from 6+8+2 to 4+8+4.",Neutral
AMD,"Do you mean Strix Halo?  Halo is made up of THREE dies. Two are regular CCD and one is a ~300mm2 graphics die. Total die area is around 440mm2 IIRC.  It's expensive, but not THAT expensive.",Neutral
AMD,Doesn't this depend on use case? AMD laptops are more capable for gaming and the iGPU can also use the lesser version of FSR. Intel is obv better for productivity.,Positive
AMD,"I disagree, Arrow lake HX seems to be more expensive than AMD HX as least on Lenovo Legion Pro setup.   I would have buy Arrow lake for the same price but AMD is cheaper by $200.",Negative
AMD,Eh? It's a standard 128 bit memory bus.​,Neutral
AMD,"You can't price it higher than people are willing to pay, how high that is I have no idea, people bonkers buying CPU only laptops at these high prices if gaming is something they really want to do.",Negative
AMD,Oems magically dont price intel variants as if they were made out of gold?,Negative
AMD,"Lmao check the data, Intel has 79% of the laptop market share currently",Neutral
AMD,"Reddit isn’t indicative of anything really, most casual laptop buyers don’t even know what AMD is.",Negative
AMD,"I wouldn't be surprised if this is because the team has chosen to focus efforts on UDNA because that's the architecture next-gen consoles would use. They only have so much talent and headcount on their graphics division after all, and consoles have much higher volume (even tho low margins) and thus take priority.",Neutral
AMD,AMD is planning on again using RDNA 3.5 on their next mobile chips as well.,Neutral
AMD,Not an ideal solution but Optiscaler exists,Negative
AMD,"NVIDIA has increased margins but they haven't been that terrible. Part of the compounding issue at play is limited TSMC capacity; with both gaming and DC on the same TSMC node.  Ampere (crypto bubble ignoring) was priced well and many excellent cards in there since it was on Samsung, a cheap fab; while DC/workstation chips got TSMC.",Neutral
AMD,Who said anything about basing the entire product stack around handhelds?,Neutral
AMD,"That's not quite right. Power levels are determined by the frequency of a given CPU core. The LPE cores in Lunar and Panther lake both clock up to 3.7 GHz, so given the added IPC of the new Panther lake e-cores and better process node, it is more efficient. Base power levels tell you nothing really.",Neutral

AMD,"Yeah, it's a proper generational jump. Intel marketing is just dumb, and the comments from Peterson claiming Xe3 is somehow a smaller jump than Xe3p are just laughable.",Negative
AMD,The reason is marketing (the Battlemage brand is hot and filled with good will ATM so resetting to celestial so soon is not ideal regardless of panther Lake being xe³) Peterson addressed this a bit ago.,Neutral
AMD,Xe3p was alr confirmed coming im sure Celestial happens,Neutral
AMD,"We will see, while Intel's PR and marketing is extremely confusing, Intel did confirm Xe3P will come to desktop; and at least from driver updates (as a very happy B580 owner) driver support has been constant and lively.  I had some issues with an older Civ game, I reported an issue in [their app](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000057021/graphics/other-graphics.html) with screenshots/etc, and while I never got any notification, the game works perfectly now a few months later. Dunno if they read those reports, but my card keeps getting better.  I actually think a MSRP B580 is another card that will age like fined wine -- YMMV depends on games you play, but in Australia they have been regularly sold slightly below international MSRP and represent phenomenal value in the price class.",Positive
AMD,That's bloody good for an iGPU. It's been nice to see them finally get to respectable performance over the last few years. Intel in particular has really upped their iGPU game & it shows.,Positive
AMD,not to mention it is a little skewed as they threw in a title which pushed the vram limit on the 4050 making the b390 over 800 percent faster in that title which obviously messes with the average.,Negative
AMD,It's 10% faster geomean across 45 games,Positive
AMD,That can be resolved if either Intel or AMD decides to unlock quad-channel on consumer chips and mobos. It's artificial market segmentation; the die area needed to deliver more (LP)DDR5 channels is absolutely minuscule; for a huge boost in iGPU performance.,Neutral
AMD,Cache. Lots of it.,Neutral
AMD,"They are using 9600mt/s lpddr5x, could also have a lot of cache, (iirc 890m configs were nerfed in cache because they wanted to put a npu instead), and also could be a synthetic benchmark or specific game that isn't very bandwidth heavy.",Neutral
AMD,Panther Lake still has a 128 bit memory bus so only models with 9600 mt/s will get slightly faster shared memory bandwidth than Lunar Lake.   I wonder how this will manifest in games as the only performance leaks have been from Geekbench and 3DMark which may not be as bandwidth intensive as real games and applications.,Neutral
AMD,"This seems to be correct, since checking NotebookCheck for the 30 watt 4050 shows that it’s around 70% faster than the HX370 in games, which is roughly where Intel places their iGPU.  The performance difference between a 30 watt 4050 and full 140 watt 4050 is around 41 percent performance based on Time Spy",Positive
AMD,"basically cheating tho, rtx cards in dell laptops are barely getting enough watts to even turbo",Negative
AMD,"That's the only way to do a fair comparison, really.   Because the 45 watts that Intel chip uses is shared for the entire chip.   So it's still 45w Intel + igpu vs 60w Intel+gpu",Neutral
AMD,"It’s a super strong generational gain though, it’s like the jump from Vega 8CU to rdna2 12CU. The kind of single gen gain you see once in 5 years at most",Positive
AMD,The thing about that... what sort of tile are we expecting them to package up? As you say if we can get 4050ish performance from an Intel iGPU then they really can't be far off 5050M... and maybe even 5060M performance in future.  Do you think they'll offer something like a 5070 tile? that almost seems excessive (and difficult to actually package from a thermal point of view in a laptop) but it seems like the 5050/5060 sort of tier is going to be pretty well covered as a traditional iGPU soon.,Neutral
AMD,AMD actually introduced lower tier Strix Halos in this CES; and the first budget laptop thats gonna use it is [the Asus TUF A14](https://youtu.be/h27w0PXFBgk?si=Pa7UQhinywF-uFMj&t=306),Positive
AMD,They're a lot more accurate than whatever the fuck Nvidia has been doing where you have to decode their bar graphs for proper scaling lmao,Negative
AMD,"I'm pretty sure Intel threw lots of ""marketing money"" for the MSI Claw too.

I picked one up for about $550 AUD (after rebates; tax included), which is like $369 USD inclusive of tax.",Neutral
AMD,> Lunar Lake was a expensive product which didn't make sense in handhelds   What do you mean? All the tradeoffs LNL made were pretty good fits for a handheld.,Neutral
AMD,"I don't think that will really be an issue, laptops can be configured with soldered 8 channel RAM like AMDs Z2 extreme, or they can still manage easily with regular DDR5 6400Mhz sodimms, which run at 102.4GB/s  Plus the CPUs that have intels new B390 iGPU are 4P/8E CPUs, so I doubt there will be much issues from low ram speeds. Something like the Radeon 890M have done fine with such speeds",Neutral
AMD,"> I've been eyeing Dells and Lenovos, and basically all SKUs that previously had 6000 are getting substituted with 4800   You're looking at normal DDR, not LPDDR. LPDDR5-9600 *is* a JEDEC spec, and already available in mobile.",Neutral
AMD,"The majority of the lineup still only has 4. Will be interesting to see what the pricing and performance is on those since these will likely be quite limited. What's also a bit crazy is there's three different nodes being used for the various GPUs, and the full 12 unit one is probably on N3.",Neutral
AMD,"I doubt it's exactly 73% outside of cherrypicked games, but it should not be shocking that it's significantly faster than rehashed rdna3.",Neutral
AMD,"Every Intel marketing benchmark for like a decade or so, but especially their GPUs seem to do far better in their benchmarks than they do in reality.",Positive
AMD,"Ice lake, Alder lake, Metor Lake",Neutral
AMD,"Different poster than OP.  Compute tile on Lunar Lake is 140mm2 on N3E with a small 46mm2 controller N6 tile. Strix Point (HX 370) as a whole is 233 mm2 on N4P. Lunar Lake is clearly cheaper, but given the newer node and packaging not massively so, likely by around 20-25%.  Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins. For all purposes it's an accounting trick to hide CCG's and DCAI's 5-15% operating margins if you divide the foundry losses per group revenue.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, although the actual low power 8 core successor to Lunar Lake is the 335/365 with half GPU cores and slower RAM.",Neutral
AMD,"even if you exclude the CPU CCDs the graphics die alone is bigger than a RTX 5070Ti mobile GPU, which also retails for \~$2000-$3000, same as Strix Halo laptop",Neutral
AMD,"This is slightly splitting hairs but the 8c CCDs in Strix Halo is actually NOT the same chiplet as the ones in desktop zen 5 parts. It iirc is produced on a smaller node, slimmed down, and has different ( or no) TSVs.  It is similar to design and cache sizes to desktop however, but the changes to the CCDs were done to improve low power performance characteristics. They are likely a bit more expensive than Desktop CCDs.  I believe it is discussed in a chips&cheese deep dive.",Neutral
AMD,"AMD have largely been ""winning by doing nothing"" due to their better driver support stack for gaming on iGPUs, rather than actually throwing superior hardware at it.  It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.  Given how effective DLSS is on the Switch2, one could only imagine how kickass a Nvidia chip in a handheld PC could be with the far more ubiquitous DLSS support.",Neutral
AMD,Now they are not. The panther lake igpus are undisputed winners (excluding the 395+ from amd since it's just not gonna be mainstream). You can get a 358H or 368H and you'll have solid laptop for igpu gaming far cheaper than the 395+,Positive

AMD,"Well you said it, it's TSMC capacity, meaning also a priority issue. They prioritize AI over consumers and then increase the price by reducing availability, meaning the same chip costs more, meaning more margin.  Seeing they increase the 5090 to roughly 5k (USD) is just the beginning and as I know all companies will use the increasing memory prices to say they must increase the product price, just not proportional to the memory costs.  next step: then they will use this to move more to streaming instead of owning",Neutral

AMD,But lunar lake igpu actually perform better than 890M.Like comparison of core ultra 7 and z2 extreme in handheld like msi claw.,Positive
AMD,">The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.     The mainstream unit that's more directly comparable to LNL is the same core count (4+0+4) with a smaller iGPU tile. It'll be cheaper.  The 4+8+4 w/ 4Xe is the direct replacement to ARL-H, and that should also be cheaper than ARL-H.",Neutral
AMD,"True, but then still, that's not a removal of CPU cores like they said it was.",Neutral
AMD,That is due to the Nvidia tax and AI bubble rather than the production cost of the chip. Even Apple ships cheaper silicon than that.,Neutral
AMD,"This is very topical and cyclical of Intel/AMD. Intel did really poorly for like a half a decade which was unusual but usually they go back and forth.

Intel is planning on socketing a ton of cache on their next breed of chips which will massively boost their gaming perfomance and they have pretty darn efficient chips now too.",Neutral

AMD,"XeSS and FSR 4 on RDNA 3 both use downgraded versions of those upscalers, that either look worse, perform worse, or both. In the case of FSR 4, it's a leaked one-off model that people got their hands on. All I really meant by ""decent"" was having an officially supported modern upscaler without all the downsides.

AMD,"Yeah all depends on pricing, 6 core ultra 5 model is however technically downgrade from last generation and the same core config as the i3 1315U.",Neutral
AMD,Honestly not that unusual. It takes an average of around 4-5 years to develop a processing unit from the ground up. If we assume each one does this when they get mushroom stamped by the other for being lazy it accounts for the 5 years gaps till they show back up with something to sell.,Neutral
AMD,"I think AMD is getting a bit lazy when it comes to consumer graphics. I think their attempts at laptop have been really half-assed given just how good their IP portfolio is.  But when it comes to their core businesses, they're definitely been keeping the heat on and have been quite aggressive. They're datacenter first and foremost, and that trickles down to amazing desktop CPUs too. They're heavily focused on building out their Mi series too...but they're just dropping the ball in laptop and consumer GPU",Negative

AMD,"> Same thing will happen here, AMD will release a new iGPU architecture   ... Based on what history? AMD's iGPU has not significantly changed in years. It's still hugely memory bottlenecked and no matter how many times they add an extra 2 CU's, it will still be memory bottlenecked.  IIRC someone disabled 2 CU's on their 7000 series APU and their in-game FPS almost didn't change because the bottleneck was actually memory access.  Intel ARC is actually very good on this metric. Intel doesn't exactly need to sling anything better than ""slightly more Battlemage on a better transistor"" to completely swamp out AMD iGPU in this space.",Negative
AMD,"Intel Panther lake base tdp is 25w, around the same as AMD Strix Point/ Gorgon Point. Why will they compare it to a 55w tdp Strix Halo?",Neutral
AMD,"Even on the budget laptops category the new Ryzen 7s suck compared to the Intel Lunar Lake options, they seem to be priced closer with Lunar Lake getting stuff like nice displays. In the really budget category I feel like they are tied on value and I don't know how sales affect that. This is partially cause AMD went cheap on the mid-range kraken point chips and also had to fit in the still dead weight 40 tops NPU for Microsoft. So it only has 8 GPU cores.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah but basically unusable on pre 40 series. But at least NVIDIA gives users the choice.  AMD should just stop the BS pretending and just enable the full FP8 model across RDNA2-3 with FP16 emulation.

AMD,"If you're referring to the April dump, heck even the August dump (analysis of Kepler\_L2 patents) then that's not close to the complete picture. A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.  Sorry for the rambling.",Neutral

AMD,"I enjoy reading your optimism. I hope it all comes true, but it sounds a bit too good to be true given the recent hardware developements. The 5090 scaling issue is that we stopped resolution scaling. If you go beyond 4k the 5090 scales a lot. VR resolutions report the 5090 being as much as twice the framerates of 4090.",Positive
AMD,I've rewritten prev reply to provide more info.  I'll also link the scheduling patent here in case anyone reading this thread is interested: [https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2)   It sounds like gains in workgraphs scenarios will be be even greater.,Positive
AMD,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW? But yeah high end perf scaling falls apart at sub 4K internal res.",Negative
AMD,"I dont think much can be done with overhead. AMDs overhead is already small, basically letting the API go directly to GPU as it is. While for Nvidia side, isnt most of the overhead related to how Nvidia handles DX12? in that case i dont see it going away for a long time.",Negative

Small, portable, gets the job done, easy to replace and fit in all situations.  These would be a very nice drop-in replacement for those. These aren't designed for individual buyers, though they certainly won't mind the sales. It's more targeting corporate deployments where a company will want to buy hundreds to thousands or more, have them easily stored in a warehouse that can quickly be deployed when needed. When a computer for work breaks, I let my project manager know and they'll contact logistics to organize a swap, happened a few times last year and recently just had to swap a computer out due to a broken power button. These are super convenient for such cases, especially with office work where they take way more abuse as they remove the fragile screen + hinge on laptops if they're gonna be used in a situation where nobody cares about them.  My main concern is the keyboard. In office, keyboard and mouse are replaced all the time, so having one tied to the rest of the hardware is problematic. Companies often favour buying the cheapest en-masse and replace when broken, as hiring someone to fix expensive stuff that nobody cares about is not cost efficient. Yes you can just plug a new keyboard in, but I do have a bit of e-waste concern if some companies simply decide to throw them out due to speed/efficiency, kinda like how mostly fine laptops that have some broken bits are sadly discarded all the time by companies.  Then again, throwing away this is less wasteful and cost efficient than throwing away a laptop, so maybe it's still net better.",Positive

(keep in mind browsers allocate more ram than they use, so don't count those as they allocate it, but give it up when something else requests it, and they put hold on tabs that are not in focus releasing that from ram if idle long enough, etc..).  Just assume ""browser"" is going to use like 5gb MAX unless you have open browsers on like 3 displays all playing videos and HTML5/js games at the same time.   I doubt minecraft or sims 4 needs more than 16, and probably leaves plenty of headroom to do other things at the same time within reason.

AMD,"""My CPU is running very hot and some games that I have played for years are starting to freeze my computer and I have to forcefully turn it off and back on.""   This usually means a CPU repaste rather than a replacement...try that before you drop a Benjamin plus.",Negative
AMD,>My CPU is running very hot and some games that I have played for years are starting to freeze my computer and I have to forcefully turn it off and back on.  Have you tried reapplying the thermal paste on the CPU cooler? That’s the most likely issue.,Negative
AMD,That’s about as good as you can do since the x3d CPU’s are so expensive now. Can you run your ram at a higher speed? You’ll see a good improvement if you can,Positive
AMD,You don’t need an upgrade. You need to remaster it and maybe get a better cooler. I’ve had a 3600 for 5 years and it champs.,Positive
AMD,Very good plan! That's gonna be your best bet for sure,Positive
AMD,Do consider getting a 3200 Mhz RAM kit if possible later down the road. It makes a noticeable difference.,Positive
AMD,kinda sucks that I saw a 5800xt going for like 150 a few months ago but I figured it would be even cheaper in like 6 months or a year when I was planning on upgrading.,Negative
AMD,"Both great choices. Unless you trip over an msrp 5800x3d, that's the best you can get without going ddr5",Positive
AMD,i like the aesthetic of the one on amazon with the digital display and its only like 10 bucks more than the non digital display one.,Positive
AMD,Only downside is that it will block my second ram slot. I will have to remove my third ram stick and downgrade back to 16gb ram.,Negative
AMD,"I figured this might also be the case, but I do not mind upgrading as I can afford the new components.",Positive
AMD,I would check the mounting of your CPU cooler.  Uneven pressure can cause overheating as well.,Negative
AMD,"I figured this might also be the case, but I do not mind upgrading as I can afford the new components.",Positive
AMD,"I am not sure, I have never tried increasing ram speed.",Neutral
AMD,"It does work good! Like I said, it has almost been 6 years and it is still going strong.",Positive
AMD,"I almost bought that one, but reviews were inconsistent about the reliability of the display so I played it safe and got the PS Evo off eBay for $40 total, been satisfied so far!",Positive
AMD,I guess I'm a little confused. The fan on the cooler will block the ram stick? If that's the case you can move the fan to other side of the cooler if that doesn't bother your aesthetic,Neutral
AMD,"I would say 5800xt. It is cheaper than 5800x for some reason and a Lil faster. Buy a beefy air cooler tho, nx600 or pa120se",Neutral
AMD,"You may want to try anyway, in case you have other faulty components that are causing the freezing/crashing (eg could be bad mobo, ram, PSU)  If one of your other components is bad, that may change your purchasing decision. _Eg if it’s a bad mobo you may want to switch to Intel and get a faster 14th gen CPU for the same price._  Also, right now you can’t really sell the CPU in good faith as “working condition” because it could well be faulty. That changes how much money you get back from selling it.",Negative
AMD,"the display model is just the ps evo with a magnetic attachment that has a single connector for the mobo. you could probably buy the magnetic attachment/ display thing separate if you wanted. i just look it because i get curious about temps. i dont have to like run a separate program to see where im peaking at.   it is a software start at windows (there is a linux program as well) but the software is barebones, hence the ability for fans to make a linux program.",Neutral
AMD,I am just looking at pictures of videos of it. I will have a tech expert install it for me and they can decide the best way to orient it.,Neutral
AMD,Is the wraith prism that it comes with not sufficient enough?,Neutral
AMD,"I'm sure they'll get it set up for you! Enjoy whatever upgrades you go with, I think you have a good plan",Positive
AMD,"No, they run quite hot, and a twin tower, dual fan is likely what op will need, possibly an aio if planning on an oc",Neutral
AMD,"The performance gap between the 9070 and 9070 XT is honestly not as huge as people make it out to be, maybe 10-15% in most games. At 1440p high settings you're still gonna get solid framerates with the regular 9070     If saving that extra cash means you can actually finish your build sooner rather than waiting months, I'd just go with the non-XT and call it a day. You can always upgrade down the line when prices aren't completely bonkers",Neutral
AMD,The one you have money for,Neutral
AMD,"I love my 9070 non xt. It runs very cool, has solid OC potential. Low power draw means you can use a less potent psu. Performance is decent at 4k and solid at 1440",Positive
AMD,Nothing wrong with the non xt. I had a 6700 non xt and was really happy with how quiet and cool it ran. Most purple were saying to get the 9070xt mainly cause the non xt didn't go down in price enough. Might as well pay $50 for something better. If you see a fair bit of a decrease where you are then do that.,Positive
AMD,"I picked the 9070 specifically because I wanted a GPU that would be below 200W during gaming, with a bit of tweaking to power, my 9070 runs at a max of 195W, at 1440p I can run any game without issue, and I run RT in Cyberpunk 2077 and still get 80-90FPS on average with FSR balanced mode.",Positive
AMD,"I like that 9070 will run at 220w while xt will run at 300w, while only being 10%ish slower. 32% lower power consumption, 10% lower performance. I'll take that any day.   But to be fair, I live in Phoenix AZ, with a SFFPC, so hot rigs are not fun.",Positive
AMD,with the ability to easily flash the bios now I think that makes the 9070 even more appealing,Positive
AMD,"GPUs are probably only going to get more expensive with AI and reduced production, so make of that as you will. Assuming nothing changes things won't improve until around 2028, so personality id get the xt if you can afford it, makes your rig a little more futureproof and now is probably the lowest price it'll be for a while.",Negative
AMD,"There are a lot of factors were missing too. Factors like the games your playing, which monitor you have, what your other hardware you have, and if/when you're planning on upgrading, will all have a huge impact on accurate recommendations in a vacuum.  But considering it's your first PC, and you need to save for it to that degree, in this economy, my advice is neither. Save your money and get a used RTX 3070 on eBay. About 1/3 the price for about 2/3 the performance, and don't worry, it'll still crush 1440p in most games if you're not too greedy with the settings.",Neutral
AMD,non-XT serves me really well. I went with it because the XT is around 25% more expensive and I love power efficient GPU.   > but is the actual difference that massive?  [around 10% fps difference on average](https://youtu.be/YWUqsqcM4Hs?si=8ZRhNp8x-zxmzHrQ&t=818),Positive
AMD,"It depends on your objective. Obviously get your ram asap. Check out the used market for that. That will save you tons. I’m always about getting a bit more performance than you think you need so your system will have longevity. But getting going can be a greater good, so don’t think you need to wait. The 9070 will serve you well. I did a few builds. The 9060xt system I built for their mom’s house does great for what they play. I have a 3060ti that still works great for a lot of what they play. My other two, 7900xtx and 9070xt are overkill, but the 3060ti was struggling, and certainly can’t do 4k on the 32 in screens I have. It’s on a 1440p screen.",Positive
AMD,"at 1440p high settings the non-xt will be plenty fine, you're looking at like 15-20% performance difference which sounds bigger than it feels when you're actually playing. if you're not chasing 144+ fps or maxing everything out, save the money and don't think about it again.",Neutral
AMD,"I have a non-xt.  It's pretty great.  If the cost difference matters to you, you won't be leaving much behind in terms of performance.  I generally get 100FPS+ on my 3440x1440 display with most any game on higher settings.  I might have to turn this or that down on occasion, but I never feel like I'm missing anything with my setup.  I'm in a SFFPC case, so I was willing to trade peak performance for the lower heat generation, and I feel like I've found a good balance there.",Positive
AMD,I was looking at RX 9070s but ultimately couldn't justify the expense. However they will be excellent 1440p or 4K gaming GPUs.,Positive
AMD,"I got myself a 9060xt 16gb because 9070(xt) is just about double the price where I'm from, and with that money I could upgrade to a much better gpu a few years down the road.",Positive
AMD,"I have a sapphire nitro+ 9070, and I couldn't be happier with the performance at 1440p.  For an extra 100w of power usage you are getting about 10-15% more performance with a 9070xt over a 9070 but when you are already hitting 100+ fps in games it's not a huge deal.  Avatar: Frontiers of pandora runs at over 100 on high  Indiana jones and the great circle runs at over 100 on high  Fortnite on max settings including raytracing is over 130fps.   Honestly, the only problem with going for the 9070 over the 9070XT is most of the focus goes to the XT version so you'll see way more people talking about that in videos and such.",Positive
AMD,"Ray Tracing is becoming non optional with new AAA games. 9070 XT is about 10% better then the non XT, so you decide if that's worth the extra money to you. Personally I would go for RTX 5070 instead of the non XT 9070, DLSS 4.5 is really good and it's even cheaper.",Positive
AMD,Consider the 9060xt 16gb. What monitor do you have. That really matters! 1080p-1440p-4k is a huge difference. As is the frequency. Doesn’t matter if your GPU can push 600fps if your monitor can only output 120fps. I’d rather get a 9060xt 16gb and a monitor upgrade than a 9070 or 9070xt.,Neutral
AMD,On average it's about 13% or 11 FPS difference at 1440p.  9070 is way more power efficient too.,Positive
AMD,"Got a regular 9070 on 1440 myself, eats everything I throw at it. Even pathtracing in 2077 is playable with FSR4.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah it's a beast of a card, and i don't know why but i haven't seen people having issues with their 9070. About the XT i read it all the time. Might be simply because the XT is much more popular, who knows.  I was actually just messing around with undervolting and OCing the 9070 and managed to run it upto 3200 seemed pretty stable so far.",Positive
AMD,"I mean you could just set a -25% power limit in adrenaline and it will bring it down to around 220 with more performance. If the price is close enough, the xt is the way to go. But the 9070 is a beast too if that's what you want.",Positive
AMD,"This matches my experience at 3440x1440 in our SFFPC (Fractal Terra). The 9070 does a great job. We have a 5070 Ti in the other PC and unless you have an FPS counter on, the differences aren't perceptible in most games.",Positive
AMD,"This! Or a 3070 or 4060 ti, nearly the same performance, but $100+ cheaper yet on eBay. If you're at the point where you need to save for a couple of months to get a GPU, you probably shouldn't be getting one, and if you do, you should get the cheapest thing you can get away with that gives you the performance you want.",Neutral
AMD,"For a couple months the XT was available below MSRP while it's competition, the 5070 ti was $200 more expensive. So everyone and their grandmother bought one (me included)",Neutral
AMD,"u shouldn't mix mix ram with any cpu but it probably won't be a big deal u could just manually tune it yourself even if they are different dies to get something decent but that requires some tinkering. Could also get lucky and find out they are the same die which would be nice.  the 5700x would be somewhere between a 12400f and 12600k/kf or around the 10700k,11700k, 11900k, 10900k, 10850k.",Neutral
AMD,"10700k/11700k iinm. I have the 10900 before and it's pretty much stable with xmp set @ 3600MHz.  But if you want the best intel cpu for gaming then it's the 14600k/14700k. Those are pretty good in gaming and workload situations. The e-cores don't do much in gaming but for everything else, it's pretty good.  Remember to always update your bios to the latest microcode if you intend to buy either of those cpus.",Positive
AMD,"Given that the 12600k beats the 5800x and the 5700x is a downclocked 5800x, I would say this is the closest Intel equivalent to the 5700x.",Neutral
AMD,"Depending on what programs compare, anything from a 10600 to 12700K. AMD and Intel CPUs are very different, and only got even more different, as of 12th gen. If you can swing it, buying new, consider the 5800XT.  > it's a problem and to not mix ram sticks with a AMD CPU.  No, in that it can be a problem with Intel CPUs, too. But, a pair that works well on one may not on another. Things usually work OK, with DDR4, but mixing RAM is a bit of a lottery, if you can't verify the ICs being used.",Neutral
AMD,Don’t go intel and about the ram: you will have the chance it not working or it will run at the speed (in this case latency) of the slower ram. Xmp will be tricky because it’s already fonky.,Negative
AMD,"How does it work if I want to tinker?   I put the hardware in the case, turn on the PC. Is there a chance of it not working there already or will it always go to the basic **without** xmp 2133 and I can tinker later?",Neutral
AMD,"How does that work?   I put the hardware in the case, turn on the PC. Is there a chance of it not working there already or will it always go to the basic no xmp 2133 and I can tinker later?",Neutral
AMD,yeah JEDEC should run fine. Different JEDEC profiles do exist but the system should default to the slower one if they are different.,Neutral
AMD,There IS a chance not working at all but probably it works with 2133,Neutral
AMD,"Thansk you. Do you think the risk is big enough that I better switch to Intel or is the different neglectible if I lower xmp speeds or even turn it off?   If I run the ram on 2133 speed instead of the 3000 it works on now, do I lose a lot of performance? I'm pairing with a 90690xt so my hardware isn't top notch to begin with, I don't know if that matters.",Negative
AMD,You know xmp is from intel and basically indicates that it works with intel cpu…even you shut down xmp,Neutral
AMD,Xmp works with amd too,Neutral
AMD,"It's good for light gaming, speaking from experience since a friend still has it. But it's not gonna run new titles very well, if at all. Almost certainly not the new RE game.  I'd like to ask what price you're seeing this at, too. There may be way better options. If you can find a 580 8 GB for nearly the same price, I'd recommend that a lot more. But maybe we can find something even better for you.",Negative
AMD,"It's a solid little GPU. However, make sure you aren't spending too much on it (I.e RX 580 prices). If you're spending more than £100 on it, i'd just get a GTX 1660 Super/Ti over it, but if it's sub 50-60, it's fine",Neutral
AMD,"Yes. The people who are saying no don't know what they're talking about. [Here's a video from last year showing a bunch of games and their performance on the RX 470.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU0BhOQnSPU) You won't be able to play super intensive games, but stuff like Cyberpunk, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Resident Evil should be playable at 1080P low.",Neutral
AMD,Short Answer: No  Long Answer: Nooooo,Neutral
AMD,"Get an RX 580 8 GB, it still holds up decently for 1080p gaming, while RX 470 is really subpar, and suffers from some driver issues.",Negative
AMD,it's a MSI btw,Neutral
AMD,"If you're going for a older graphics card, look for 1660s/2060s/1080ti  Those cards will serve your needs much better and honestly rx470/570/480/580 were ripped dumped in huge quantities after the mining boom so I'd never go with that even if going for a gpu that old",Neutral
AMD,"Am currently testing an **E3-1270 v2/16GB DDR3/RX 470 8GB/Garuda Dr460nized Gaming/256GB SSD boot drive/500 GB SSD storage drive** build. The major stutters that were happening while textures load from a **1.5TB 5400 HDD** storage drive are gone. There are some micro stutters still but those are tolerable given the age of the system.  The 2022 Tiny Tina's Wonderlands (TTW) via STEAM running at 1080p LOW/MED/FSR 2.0 mix gets ***88+ FPS*** on the in-game benchmark...on ***Linux*** of all things! It's all in the settings mix. Been keeping me entertained even though it clearly is slower than my Ryzen 5 5600/B580 LE build that runs TTW at 1080p ULTRA with 95+ FPS. Even managed to undervolt the RX 470 by 243 mV to jump from 82+ FPS to the current 88+ FPS.  Another test just completed is that with a Linux distro and an AMD GPU that has no hardware ray tracing support (i.e., the RX 470 8GB), it is possible to have ***software emulation ray tracing***. Ran Little Nightmares Enhanced (STEAM) on 1080p ULTRA with HIGH Ray Tracing (the lowest available RT option) and got 10-20 FPS...unplayable...*BUT* with FSR Balanced turned on, then got 40-50 FPS that is totally playable.

So, if a RX 470 8GB can do all this with an E3-1270 v2...a 14 year-old CPU...with your 5500, the 470 certainly will be able to too.  The only caveat is don't overpay for that RX 470 8GB. Check recent Sold listing prices on eBay to gauge. Because of the success I got, I bought a new RX 580 8GB for $80.81 USD total for my E5-2697 v2 build that will be converted from Win10 to a Linux gaming distro.",Neutral
AMD,"No it is not justified. I came from rx 570 4GB and i had a really bad time with many titles to achieve stable 60fps/medium to high settings, my bare minimum with newest of games. Terrible experience, bad lows, lack of VRAM, terrible optimizations since no more support from AMD thru drivers...a mess.  Don't buy it. I bought an 9060xt 16GB triple fan and i am very very happy with performance, temperature and efficiency let alone upscaling and frame generation is dope for heavy titles. Let alone 60fps is too easy to hit, i get 120-150-200 fps on 1080p max settings in most games, taking advantage of my 144hz monitor on single player games .. so dope.",Negative
AMD,You got a budget in mind? Any leftover parts?,Neutral
AMD,"Its a 10year old GPU, what do you think, it can run games from that era aka PS4 but anything newer it will struggle or not even work.  The 4gb vram will hold you back as much as raw performance.",Negative

AMD,"The r5-5600 would be within an average of about 8% slower than the r7-5800XT in terms of gaming headroom.  They are essentially the same CPU with the r5 series just having two cores disabled.  Because of that the performance difference for most games is down to the boost clock.  When the r5-5600T was $100 USD it really was a bargain.  With your GPU playing on a 1440p monitor you would likely never know the difference.  Keep in mind the r5-5600, 5600T, 5600X, and 5600XT are all essentially the same thing.  Likewise the r7-5700X, 5800X, and 5800XT are all the same CPU at the core level.",Neutral
AMD,Those tests in this video are with a 4090 as a GPU.       And the difference is none existing.      You only have a low-mid tier GPU. Which makes the difference even smaller        https://youtu.be/7L9rPNSuPCA?si=IJH-kWoa_f94T5AR.          Pick the cheaper CPU.             Makes no sense to pay more for 1 fps,Neutral
AMD,"23% price difference is not horrible, but it's a minor benefit for gaming, you'll be fine either way.",Positive
AMD,"You are, in actuality paying the 23% more for two extra cores. The 5600 is a six core, twelve thread cpu, the 5700 is eight core sixteen thread cpu. Many games don’t really use above six cores, yet. If you can afford it I would really recommend going with the 5700. If you are missing performance, then you can’t really overclock the cpu to have two extra cores? The 5700 will win in every multi core scenario compared to the 5600.",Neutral

AMD,You won't see much of a difference. Doesn't make sense to upgrade. Do you really need it?,Negative
AMD,"I'm in Australia, so no unfortunately haha. I've had a look at some of the upgrade prices around here, and just the price of the RAM is more than getting a 5700x3d off ebay/amazon (though they're also too expensive for my budget). Plus the cost of a motherboard and processor on top of that",Negative

AMD,"30% single core performance increase, 24% multi core performance increase. That's a decent uplift imo. Especially being able to stay on the same platform.",Positive
AMD,I'm in Aus too. I'd look at a 57/58/5900x CPU. Will give a decent uplift in performance.,Positive
AMD,"Honestly, you don't need to change your CPU, since a 3700x doesn't significantly bottleneck the RTX 4060 at 1080p, and none at 1440p.  You can continue as is. But if you insist on changing, a Ryzen 7 5800XT is the only one that will give you a significant improvement of up to 30 fps in single-player and 100 fps or more in competitive play. Obviously, this depends on the game.  Anything less than the 5800xt won't give you a noticeable improvement, so it would be a waste of money for 10 or 15 fps.  You should only change components when they will give you 30% or 50% more performance than what you already have, and I don't know what resolution you play at or what your monitor's refresh rate is, so if you're playing at 60 fps, the change makes even less sense.",Neutral

AMD,Thank you,Positive
AMD,I mean look its not the greatest but the 5700x is a great final upgrade to any AM4 system with 8 very capable cores that's both pretty efficient and easy to cool. Now if u can find a decent deal on a 5900x then that too would be a good choice to ride out the current PC parts pricing issues,Positive
AMD,"5800XT or 5900XT would be my suggestions, the 5800XT is the fastest non-X3D AM4 for gaming and being 8-core/16-thread is still good for productivity. 5900XT would actually be slower in single core/single thread performance compared to the 5800XT, but is a 16-core/32-thread that's really solid for productivity work and would still be a notable upgrade over a 3600 for gaming don't get me wrong.",Positive

AMD,"Realistically, probably the 5700x.  The best possible would be either the 5800x3d or 5700x3d but those are not in production anymore so you won't be able to find them new and used is a crapshoot.",Negative
AMD,Ryzen 5700x is probably your best choice but will only get around a 30% boost in single core workloads. The extra cores will help in some games but not others. I'd assume an average of 40% increase which is worth it imo. It's a shame you cant find a 5700x3d because it's 60-70% faster than a 3600.,Positive

If you can find used Ryzen 7 5800X3D or 5700X3D units from reputable sellers, they’re even better for gaming, but the 5800X is still top tier for your needs and pairs perfectly with the RTX 3070 at 1440p. The Ryzen 9 5900X is another option if you want extra cores for heavy workloads, but the 5800X hits the sweet spot.",Positive
AMD,"5900x. Even if you game most of the time, when you do that production stuff you'll want a cpu that can handle it.   5950x is more power hungry, hotter and more expensive, and will be held back by a 8gb vram gpu. But if you'll do a lot of cpu rendering, maybe.",Neutral

AMD,"14600KF is about the same price as a 5700X, though you'll have to change mobo. But selling off your B550 + 3600 should cover the difference, it shouldn't be much more than getting a 5700X + sell off the 3600 (if at all).",Neutral
AMD,Have the same gpu/cpu combo. I found cheap 5600x and 5700x cpus on aliexpress. Ordered a 5700x as it was only $40 more than the 5600x and is easier to cool.,Positive
AMD,I'd sell you my 5700x3d lightly used for a fair price.  I don't use it enough and can go back to my R5 3600 I still have,Neutral
AMD,"Honestly, I think you should upgrade to a 5700x3d or 5800x3d. Those are very capable of even running up to a 5080 pretty comfortably. I currently have a 5700x3d and 5070 ti and I run practically any game at 1440p maxed out. Cyberpunk with path tracing on DLSS Quality and MFG x2 I get at least 100 frames at any given time.   DDR5 RAM itself isn't very noticeably faster in normal use unless you are editing to some capacity so 32GB is very nice to have currently. Upgrading your CPU will give you headroom to upgrade your GPU to the most modern GPU's without issue until you can upgrade the other components. It will require a BIOS update so keep in mind before you do the switch.     I'd say that's your cheapest route at the moment with RAM prices as high as they are and GPU prices will be ramping up in price in the coming years.",Positive
AMD,Thanks for all the responses! I realised that I'm going to likely shift to an Matx or ITX motherboard as I need to travel around quite a bit with the rig over the next couple of years.

Because there are a lot of literal scam websites like Userbenchmark that should be disregarded completely.  https://youtu.be/Awz_CG2320E  Actual reputable benchmarkers like Gamers Nexus have the 7600X3D way ahead of the 9600X in gaming.",Negative
AMD,"See this gaming benchmark. It shows 7500X3D which is a slightly lower clock speed version of 7600X3D.

Not that the 9600X won’t be more than sufficient for you if you’ve got a 5060 Ti or similar.",Neutral
AMD,Well you see. The 9600X is only a bit more than the 7600X (say 10-20ish) while being on a newer architecture making it slightly stronger. Whereas the 7600X3D is more expensive overall being currently 344.49 on pcpartpicker due to it using the 3D Vcache technology that makes it have 3x the L3 cache to help with a more consistent and overall better FPS but reduces the clock speed being around 4.7 GHz instead of 5.3 like the 7600x or 5.4 like the 9600X making it weaker in terms of single core and multi core performance. Not to mention the availability of the 7600X3D is limited to only some stores. So for 40 dollars less than the 7800X3D you're still paying a lot just for 6 cores and extra fps. Stick to the 9600X and maybe upgrade to the 7800X3D if you want,Neutral
AMD,I have a spare build with a 7600X3D and one of my friends has a 9600x.  On certain games FPS will be about the same with the 7600X3D usually being on top by a couple of fps on non CPU heavy games. You'll get a better advantage on CPU heavy games. But the 7600X3D for pure gaming is the better choice. It has noticeably lower power draw compared to the 9600x and X3D parts from what I know don't get crippled as much by ram timings as much.,Positive
AMD,"in the simpliest way possible  x3d has 3d-cache - especially great for games that can utilize it such as counter strike 2 and the x3d family as a whole is targeted at gaming purely. You get less OC potential, worse timings and it's great for games but okayish/good for use in other type of software  the 9600x on the other hand is more all-rounded - it does worse in games, especially those that utilize 3d cache but it does have better OC potential, better single and multi core perf as it's ryzen 9000 so it does better in other type of software   The choice isn't between pure performance, it's rather about the potential use for it. Check how it does in certain scenarios you will use it in and decide based on that.",Positive
AMD,"If you're just gaming, the 7600x3D is a better buy. The extra v-cache really does make a massive difference in most games.",Positive
AMD,7600X3D performs similarly to the 5800X3D.,Neutral
AMD,Your girlfriend thinks the X3D is a scam..?   Tell us more about that big dawg,Negative
AMD,"I think you have your answer from other comments. I do want to add, though: It will heavily depend on your GPU and monitor resolution as well. If you have a 5060, you'll not see any difference in performance between the two in a lot of scenarios barring super high fps esports gaming. Maybe you could share the exact games you're planning on playing along with your GPU and monitor?",Neutral
AMD,"i returned a 9600x and kept the 7600x3d. 99% of games the 7600x3d is on par or better than the 9600x. that 1% of games only need high clocks, and is where the 9600x is better.",Positive
AMD,"I picked up an open boxed 7600x3d. Great processor. I’m at 4k so there really isn’t much of a difference, I bought for resale ease.",Positive
AMD,"Could you explain this? I saw in a review that things like minecraft would run better on the X3D, but I dont know waht counts as using the large cache? If I wanted to play Diablo 4/ Baulders gate, is that something still leaning towards the X3D?",Neutral
AMD,Thank you I am finding this out now. I appreciate it wasn't aware.,Positive

AMD,"As far as I know, the only reliable way to find out is to look up benchmarks that tested the game on different CPUs.  L3 cache doesn’t have defined usage amounts. It stores things that would otherwise go in RAM, making them faster to access. But if those things were not very important to access quickly, or if the RAM needed to be accessed anyway, then more L3 cache wouldn’t help much (I’m simplifying of course). It’s not something you can tell by simply looking at a game. And even within the same game it can vary.",Neutral
AMD,"That's weird. From what I saw I believe that Minecraft doesn't really care for 3dvcache, at least not modded.  But Diablo 4 and BG3 both are noticeably better on X3D CPUs iirc.  Think of it as having a rifle and a pistol, on average the rifle should perform better, but in some tasks like having it on your body 24/7 the pistol is the choice.  Some games care for extra cache, some for GPU bandwidth, some for VRAM, some for ram, some for number of cores. Usually it's a big mix but they can have exceptions.",Neutral

AMD,"I have GPUs ranging from a 1660 super to a 9070 XT  The 3080 10 gb I have is a wonderful card still to this day. IMO: if they released this card today as *new* the only complaint would be power draw. It pulls 320w if I remember. Still, even so, it performs better than the current 60 class from both AMD and Nvidia. I would say it’s on par with a 4070 pretty much. The 3080 Ti I have, is noticeably better but after I got the 9070 XT last year I can notice the age of the card. If that makes sense. For $300 even a 10gb 3080 is a good deal if you can inspect the card first to make sure everything works as it should.   You would be good for a long time at 1080p with a 10gb card but you will see a 10gb 3080 struggle in more modern titles like BF6 at 1440p. A 12gb 3080 non Ti is only 2-3% faster but the VRAM does help at high resolution, obviously. lol  I think if the AM4 motherboard is a good unit and has the features you need. That’s a good setup imo.

Is it super noticeable if you put the settings down to high to very high? Tbh, not really.   At 1080p, the 3080 will hit max frame rate at epic to ultra settings easily for almost all games.

AMD,No! Do NOT get the 5950X. I thought it was the king when it comes to the best AM4 CPU but it only overheats the GPU and uses more power. I ran Cs2 with RTX 3070 and it would make my GPU reach 86-87c. Even with the Kraken 360 which is the best out of all it would still generate a lot of heat around the pump area. Plus you don't need all those cores and threads.  Get a 5700X or 5700X3D. My temps never went over 80c and I could for 12 hrs without overheating at all.

I paid 38 € for a small McDonald’s menu that in Germany would’ve cost me 12 € at the time, and that’s just fast food prices.   OP’s PC specs are already fucked due to RAMageddon if he were to rebuy in Ireland. If he’d rebuy in Switzerland though? He might pay double or triple the price he would pay in Ireland.

AMD,Reinstall windows. There are no if's and's or but's about it. Dont be lazy.,Neutral
AMD,Will it recognize and boot? Probably  Should you just do a fresh install anyway? Yes,Neutral
AMD,I would do a fresh install of windows but yeah should be good,Positive
AMD,I would really do a fresh install at that point. If you don’t and run into quirks you’ll never know if it’s the hardware or old install,Neutral
AMD,"Well, you need a new Mobo and new RAM for that, and after that you would need to Reinstall Windows 100%, or you will face several errors every day. Then you can install Ryzen Master to control the CPU, and I'm not sure about this, but Adrenaline also to install the Chipset Drivers, I'm not sure if Nvidia or Intel Cards make it the same way.",Neutral
AMD,Fresh install of 11.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, I know. But should the system be usable after I connect my new CPU and mobo? Will it boot?",Neutral
AMD,"Not OP, but I’m building a new rig, and was wondering what you debloater you’d recommend?",Neutral
AMD,Sure,Neutral
AMD,"Ok, but why everyone is saying I need a fresh install? I am confused.",Neutral
AMD,"Nono, Apple hasn't used Intel for years now. :D",Positive
AMD,It's not just about being lazy. I would need to buy a brand new Windows 11 copy. I can't update on my current CPU.,Negative
AMD,No,Neutral
AMD,"Most likely, but first hdd or ssd?",Neutral
AMD,"95% chance it'll work just fine. My 'tester' SSD has been in and out of about 15 different computers, and aside from Windows not being activated, it's always worked just fine after some driver installs.  If you do run into any issues, reinstalling Windows is easy enough.",Positive
AMD,"Yes, but you could run into any number of problems related to drivers.   Most people would just do a clean windows install. Some people do what you are doing and have no issues.",Neutral
AMD,"okay, just checking. you are most likely gonna have to re-install windows fresh, even if it boots up fine initially. your windows license might need to get migrated over to your new system as well. so not necessarily ""plug and play"".",Neutral
AMD,"Cause a fresh install gets rid of everything and then re-installs Windows from the ground up. No system files, configurations, or drivers leftover to potentially cause any problems. Lately, a fresh install has become less and less *necessary*.   But it’s still always going to be the most recommended way to go if you can bear starting from scratch. If not, doing a “Reset this PC” and choosing to “Keep my files” should still work just fine.",Neutral
AMD,"Bro, I'm using a windows key from windows 7.",Neutral
AMD,I have Windows 10 on an ssd,Neutral
AMD,I still don't get how the outdated Windows 10 will boot with a brand new CPU model that has been out for just a couple of months. How does it actually work?,Negative
AMD,"Yeah, I will try that first lol.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah it'll probably recognize, but its always better to fresh install (preferably to win 11) as 10  wont be supported long",Neutral
AMD,"Windows 11 is just Windows 10 stuffed into a trenchcoat along with a bunch of AI and spyware features, as far as most drivers are concerned. The majority of Windows 10 and 11 drivers are interchangeable.",Negative
AMD,"for the 1660 Ti, heck even the 3700x is probably more than enough. For the 9070 xt, i would definitely recommend upgrading to AM5 if possible.",Positive
AMD,Thanks in advance btw!,Positive
AMD,"I was in your exact same situation with the 3700x. I ended up getting the 9800x3d bundle from microcenter for $679. I think theyve gone up in price now to over $700, but i think it was worth the money",Neutral
AMD,"Since your playing 1080p, yea upgrading CPU is worth it.  I think the order of your upgrades just depends on. Preference",Positive
AMD,It would future proof me for awhile too I’ll keep looking at deals thanks!,Positive
AMD,"Am5 and X3D for what you want is more than 50% faster,  combos with ram start at around $450, I suggest you pick at least a 7600X3D it was $200 before,  buy it as a combo preferably with 32GB of ram, and that computer Will be much faster.  And when you slap a 9070xt it will fly. Don't sabotage yourself from the start , you will create a bottleneck for the new graphics.  New faster platform all the way and return that cpu. The worst thing to do is spend the money twice.  Get it right from the jump and sell the old platform, many people are looking for cheap upgrade...prices are rising,  if you can pick up both that combo and 9070xt while still at msrp at Microcenter, you would do yourself a huge favor,  if you can afford it...",Positive
AMD,Oh it’s more than enough thing has been an absolute beast for me since 2019! But that’s what I’m thinking. Sucks the closest micro center is 3hrs away.,Negative
AMD,"Hmm yeah if I return the 5800 and sell my 3800x  I wouldn’t mind dropping 700 for the 9800x3d, but is the 9800x3d overkill? I really only use my pc for gaming.",Neutral
AMD,Definitely time for an upgrade! I just wish it wasn’t overpriced like when I first bought my pc around covid!!! .__.,Negative
AMD,Yeah you’re right that seems like the best thing to do. Not gonna like I impulse bought it when I saw am4 3dx through the roof. Forgot about micro center bundles. Thanks!,Positive
AMD,"Make sure you can afford and fit 9070xt in your budget. Anything 7600X3D and up you will be fine. Once you covered that with ram, 32GB ddr5 6000 2x16gb, THEN you can debate if you want to surcharge for 7800X3D,  or 9800X3D combo.  You don't objectively need them, but if you got the leftover money after the graphics and cpu combo buy it. Focus on that 9070xt and cheaper X3d first.  9800X3D is built for cards like 5090. Even with 7600X3D you will be just fine....now , the fact people are spoiled and WANT the fastest cpu while neglecting and pairing it with weaker graphics is another silliness...  Sell the whole old platform as a combo , cpu motherboard  and ddr4 ram once you upgraded.",Neutral
AMD,Its currently the best cpu on the market for gaming  so its not really overkill when you use it for its intended purpose,Positive
AMD,"I picked up a 7700x from a microcenter bundle and it's absolutely more than sufficient for any current gen game. Just don't forget to go into BIOS and enable ""precision boost overdrive"" and set it to ""90 level 2"" (if you have a decent cooler)",Positive
AMD,Thanks I’ll keep that in mind. Already about to sell my old platform and my wife’s as well so we can both switch to am5.,Positive
AMD,Nice! Good to know I’ll check this one out too thanks!,Positive
AMD,No,Neutral
AMD,"For web dev, I’m not sure. Feel like a 5800 XT might be plenty for that  For gaming, with your GPU and depending what resolution and settings you use, most likely not worth it",Neutral
AMD,"I think it's a worthy upgrade, and you're getting a more efficient TDP of 65W  I plan to upgrade from a 5600x to a 9700x when RAM prices hopefully return to normal",Positive
AMD,I did a similar upgrade and I love it. Id do it again for sure.,Positive
AMD,"Update: Ended up going through with the AM5 upgrade to a Ryzen 7 9700X and paired it with an MSI PRO B850M-P. Been testing it all day. For web dev work, the improvement is pretty minimal overall. Builds are a bit faster, but nothing major. For gaming, there is a very noticeable improvement in smoothness in the games I play. Overall, I think it was worth it, especially since I found someone who is buying my AM4 parts for close to retail.  Big thanks to u/Symphonic7, u/monkeyboyape, and u/Royal_Aardvark_6406 for the solid discussion and helpful links. It definitely helped with the decision.",Positive
AMD,no upgrade your GPU,Neutral
AMD,"Performance wise now , no. But will it be cheaper to switch platforms in future ? I went to 7945HX , no real world difference that you would notice from day to day  , 9700x is a bit faster on single thread tasks than my HX and it's better chip overall looking at it.  5800x/XT is a bit too hot chip , i was always annoyed by cooler trying to cool it , HX rocks in that area one of the reason i changed the dam thing ( plus they sell like crazy now ) .",Neutral
AMD,Where did u get ram?,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah I think is worth. I have never experienced such upgrade but in theory there should be an improvement, just the fact that the PCIe would match in the motherboard + CPU + GPU. With such GPU, you could squeeze all it's juice.",Positive
AMD,"Flip the DDR5 ram, sell the 5060 Ti and get a 5070 Ti or 5080 if you game at 1440p. Your 5800XT is plenty for webdev, will not bottleneck the new GPU and you will get more value and impact for longer from a higher tier GPU.",Neutral
AMD,"The 9700x is in no man's land. It doesn't perform much better than a 9600x in gaming. Production work loads, sure.  But it's really not that much more for a 7800x3d. Like $80.  7800x3d is far superior in gaming and only a slight reduction in production loads from 9700x.",Negative
AMD,The 5800X/XT can be undervolted down to the 60s-70sW range and basically turn into a 65W TDP 5700X.,Neutral
AMD,I'm afraid that 9700x will be obsolete by then or you will have other worries ...,Negative
AMD,Ayy so happy for you man. I think you'll definitely appreciate those better 1% and 0.1% lows. For me its been night and day in league of legends. Post the build sometime,Positive
AMD,Upgrading a 5060 TI 16GB to play Deadlock is insanity,Negative
AMD,"Bought it off FB Marketplace from a sketchy seller. He blocked me right after pickup, and I later found one stick was broken. Luckily, Corsair approved a free RMA (I was fully expecting to pay) and sent me a brand-new kit.",Negative
AMD,Good advise. Side tangent: I hate the flipping economy. Its one of the many reasons everything is so damn expensive.,Negative
AMD,great point about the 7800x3d. Might look into upgrading to that instead if I do decide to upgrade.,Positive
AMD,This guy is clue less. It isn't far superior in gaming. You can tweak the 9700X to be on par if not faster across a wide selection of games. A tweaked 9700X is not that much slower on \*average\* than a 7800X3D. Also it would make more sense for you to upgrade your GPU at this point.,Negative
AMD,"Appreciate it! You were spot on about the 1% / 0.1% lows.  Also, here’s my full build (it's pretty basic tbh):  [https://imgur.com/bEg8ALk](https://imgur.com/bEg8ALk)  [https://imgur.com/kD7vMk4](https://imgur.com/kD7vMk4)  CPU: Ryzen 7 9700x  RAM: 32GB Corsair Vengeance RGB 6000mhz CL36  MOBO: MSI PRO B850M-P WiFi  GPU: PNY 5060 Ti 16GB OC Dual Fan  Case: GAMDIAS Aura GC10M WH  Cooler: Thermalright Assassin X 120R Digital  SSD: Samsung 990 Evo Plus 2TB  Fans:  Thermalright TL-S12RW X3 (Running these at higher RPMs for the intake)  Thermalright TL-S12W-S X3",Positive
AMD,5060 is low tier low power,Negative
AMD,"Congrats, lucky you)",Positive
AMD,"7800x3D would be a meaningful upgrade. Its genuinely a great CPU, and has some great gains in games that make use of the 3D vcache like simulation games. But I wouldn't spend money just for the sake of spending money, especially since if you upgrade the CPU you'd also have to get a new GPU to really see any difference.",Positive
AMD,"It looks super clean man, congrats on the upgrade. Try out some other games that before felt sorta off, you'd be surprised how big of a difference a strong CPU can make. If anything now just look into some tuning for the CPU like /u/monkeyboyape mentioned. Mainly I'd recommend seeing what -CO offeset you can get away with to lower power draw and temps. Cheers mate!",Positive
AMD,"I'm glad you got the 9700X. How is that cooler handling the CPU when stress testing? When I have my PBO limits set to motherboard, the CPU can still pull over 100 watts in most  games at 1440P and up to 120 watts in Cyberpunk 2077. Even when undervolted, it will still pull 170-175 watts when stress testing in Cinebench.",Positive
AMD,"I'm also looking at a 7900X. Do you think getting a 7900X now is more worthwhile since it offers a bigger upgrade path for the future (in a couple of years), like eventually moving to a 9900X3D and a better GPU?",Positive
AMD,"I haven’t had time to run Cinebench yet since I’ve been busy with work. I have noticed it runs a bit hotter compared to before, though.  Previously it wouldn’t go over 70°C while gaming, whereas now it hits the mid-70s from time to time. During dev work it usually sits in the mid-50s to low-60s, which is about 5-10°C higher than before.  I might switch PBO back to Auto for now. I do have a 420mm AIO lying around, but that would mean switching back to my old ATX case, which I’d rather not do. I’ll probably just run it stock until I find a deal on a Thermaltake The Tower 300 PC Case so I can use the AIO.",Neutral
AMD,"Frankly no, you're saving like $60 at most if youre in the US market. I also made this debate before upgrading to my 7800x3D. Unless the software you use to web dev scales with more cores and doesnt care about CCD-to-CCD latency I don't see a reason to go with the 7900X. Also in gaming its strictly worse (but not bad) than a 7800x3D.",Neutral
AMD,"I’m in Canada, so it’s only a CA$80 difference between the 7900X and 7800X3D. But I also found a deal for a 9700X, and the difference between that and the 7800X3D would be CA$160.",Neutral
AMD,"hmm I see. 160 is quite a lot honestly, that makes a big difference then. I'd say its worth going with the 9700X BUT just keep in mind that you won't see an immediate performance gain in gaming unless you also get a better GPU. X3D CPUs are the best for gaming, but something like the 9700X is no slouch.  I should have asked this first though: What resolution do you play at and what's your monitor's refresh rate?",Positive
AMD,"In gaming 7900x is more or less equal to 9700x. More cores does nothing there. So like the other guy said, unless your applications scale with more cores, you're really not gaining anything. You also lose a bit in power efficiency",Negative
AMD,"1440p 180hz though I mostly play very CPU heavy games like Deadlock, Dota 2, and simulation games.",Neutral
AMD,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNWo\_ahBTrU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNWo_ahBTrU)  Stop lying to him. It just takes 3 seconds to look into this. This is also at stock and the 9700X benefits more from unlocking it's power limits and tuning the memory.,Negative
AMD,"If you're looking to max your FPS to match the monitor's refresh rate and you're willing to upgrade your GPU down the line the 9700X would be a reasonable upgrade. Simulation games will probably see the most benefit from the upgrade. And your 1% and 0.1% lows will probably see a boost as well, making games feel smoother. Just keep expectations in check, not everything will improve.  Also sidenote, the 5800XT you have now is not a bad CPU by any means and matches the 5060 TI quite well. If I were you I'd sleep on it and see if you really want to spend the money.",Positive
AMD,"The 9700X is an incredible CPU.   [https://youtu.be/vkoiCfDK1SU?si=wFbXZPESi0pwfLH1](https://youtu.be/vkoiCfDK1SU?si=wFbXZPESi0pwfLH1)  I have mine running at 5750 MHz boost clock 2200MHz FCLK with 6400MHz CL28 UCLK=MCLK tREF 65535 All core undervolt of negative 30 with PBO limits set to motherboard. I have it running faster than a stock 7800X3D in games like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, Star Wars Jedi Survivor, Warhammer Space Marine 2, and even Monster Hunter Wilds.   Even when you just take it out of the box and don't do any tweaks to it other than enabling PBO to Auto, it is still an incredible CPU and can still beat the 7800X3D in simulation heavy games.

If you wanna take the time to walk the OP through tuning his cpu and memory, go for it. I'm not going to sit here and try to recommend a guy I don't know a product based on its overclock potential.  Fact of the matter is the 7800x3d still out performs it out of the box, even with sub optimal ram  Edit: OP if you want to see what the 9700x is capable of after feeding more power to it, overclocking it, and tuning the ram, I'll at least show you a video from a reputable source  https://youtu.be/EgOHuVvaBek?si=iwizetgm2eBTfVNH",Neutral

If you're interested, I can send you some of my screenshots of how my 9700X performs in modern CPU demanding games like Stalker 2, Space Marine 2, Monster Hunter Wilds.

AMD,"This post is kinda the result of AI being a buzzword that has lost all meaning.  Don't know all of that stuff, but the ones I do recognize are developer tools, to write your own neural network (or code in general). Notably not even necessarily generative AI, I used them for example to write a network that would remove noise from CT-scans as part of my thesis.  As for why they come with your GPU, that stuff often needs to run on a GPU and the longest time only NVIDIA had actual support with their CUDA-api. So this might be AMD informing people about them catching up; in a bit of a clumsy way to be fair.  But others have said, it does not require additional user interactions to not have it, so I would not be bothered by it personally.",Neutral
AMD,This for using AI models on your local pc. It has not much to do with the big AI provider which are causing the higher hardware prices. With 20GB vram + 32GB ram you can use a 20B model or smaller models with higher context sizes with usable output.,Neutral

No clue what the parameter count they are using but I am assuming it’s something like 13B.  VS Code, PyTorch, and Python are all for developing AI.

AMD,"Afaik they don't actually include the AI bundle as in it will download that stuff only if you want it. I think the main reason for AMD doing this is simply to make their GPU more appealing to the AI crowd since right now when you want to do AI, people (including me) always say ""go with Nvidia"" which is honestly still true. I would be very happy if this push will make more AI devs not only make their AI solution work on AMD GPU but actually optimize it to run good on AMD.  I know if you don't care about AI then this will be annoying to you, but you can't deny that the demand for AI is there and AMD is trying hard to catch up to Nvidia.   I wish they would also pay attention to other productivity stuff tho, like using their GPU for rendering in Blender is still a lot slower than the spec suggested, thus there is a potential for more optimization.  Also I really want AMD to make the Vulkan version of FSR4 and just let the RDNA3 GPU run FSR4 upscaling even if it is just running the FP8 version in FP16 thus slow. I would rather see a slow FP8 version running on RDNA3 vs nothing.",Neutral

Companies like OpenAI farm huge amounts of data and use legal loopholes to use people's data for training. It is quite honestly a hellscape, but what they're doing here is showing you that your AMD GPU is actually a legitimate option for running this stuff locally and not necessarily having to rely on a service like ChatGPT.

All these tools and utilities, are not essential to amd GPUs, nor do they rely strictly on amd GPUs.  **Its bloat.** The same sort of bloat that people complain copilot is.  **Stop bloating computer software.** Separation of concerns is a software engineering principle, stating functions and classes should be separate and have one clear and distinct purpose. If something has two distinct unrelated roles, then good practice says to split that up. AMD, a multi billion dollar hardware and software company, is violating this principle.  But honestly, I cant expect a multi billion dollar company to reasonably follow good software design. Its shocking how poorly software is made, under the guise of convienence or intuitiveness, when really on the surface its just annoying trends dictated by the same 5 companies, and underneath likely dark patterns to keep people overusing the software, or in this case, trick people into doing something they didnt ask for and dont need.  (Before someone says its not a dark pattern because its optional- no. The mere existence of the option is the dark pattern. Having a button that looks like added functionality to the product can incentivize peiple into selecting the option without understanding it or needing it. Separation of concerns applies to frontend software- one program focuses on one particular task. This installer installs a gpu driver, not AI tools.

AMD,Only on this sub could people be upset about a complete optional opt in feature set lmao. If there was an option to opt-in to free money I'm sure someone here could figure out how to be upset about it.,Negative
AMD,"The most frustrating thing about this post is the edit. Pointing out ways in which OP is factually incorrect or lacking nuance isn't the same thing as ""glazing"" AI. But apparently the only accepted opinion for OP is ""AI BAD OPTIONAL SOFTWARE BAD""",Negative

AMD,I wish my GPU supported pytorch tbh. I think it's great that they are fighting Nvidias Monopoly,Positive

AMD,As a Linux user my drivers are baked into the kernel so I don't have to deal with this. IF I wanted AI slop I'd install it myself. I don't because I hate AI and I don't feel like wasting tons of storage on slop. The only actual useful things I see there are VSCode and Python. But again I run Linux so I can just install VSCodium.

AMD,">ETA: the glazing is so funny. Apparently you can put anything in anything as long as it's optional. Including a 34 GB AI bundle that I didn't ask for.     This is for local AI means running it while having no connection to any of the big AI corpo or whatever and has some development tools too for developers even if you install them none of them would run unless you know how to configure them or know what you are doing this is for people who know what they are doing, in fact local AI is one of the good sides of all this AI drama if you want to use that is while not giving away data for free.",Positive

AMD,Thats just for installing the AMD optimized version of LM Studio quicker. I don't particularly like them bending the knee to venture capital thats all in on 'AI' either but this specifically isn't really a big deal in the grand scheme of things to be honest.,Negative
AMD,"I mean, people use these programs, really good software for ones of the easier ways to make and run large language models, so it may be useful for some users. You don't want it, you don't install it, hence ""optional"". If they persuade you into downloading this bundle, then that's an issue.  Seeing the VRAM capacity of the card, it could be easily used for AI, so that could be an inspiration for AMD to add such a bundle. Maybe it shows up only on some models of GPUs, because I don't see any sense in downloading such a bundle with a 4GB card (an RX560X in my laptop for example).",Positive

People are buying amd GPUs for local AI models OP, that's why its there, they know a lot of people are buying their cards for this specific reason. Why on earth would someone complain about something being optional when it doesn't even apply to you, just don't install it?

AMD,"Yeah, they are getting a disproportionate amount of hate for this. I get hating big AI companies like OpenAI and xAI for polluting communities, consuming copious amounts of electricity, and collecting way more personal data than they have any right to, but none of this applies to running open source models locally on your computer.  Environmentally, it isn't any more harmful than playing a demanding game, and you also have the benefits of privacy, Nothing leaves your computer.",Negative
AMD,"For people that use local AI, it also addresses one of the biggest complaints with Radeon cards. Before, you'd have to jump through so many hoops to get something like ComfyUI working (at least on Windows). You'd need to install dependencies, HIP SDKs, certain versions of Python, ZLUDA (an emulated version of CUDA) and do a bunch of command line shit just to get it working.  Because of this, people would overwhelmingly recommend buying Nvidia for AI work because it was plug and play. You downloaded it and it worked.  The point of this AI bundle is to finally bring that plug and play experience to Radeon owners. I don't know if I'll actually need any of this (I already have the portable install of ComfyUI and LM Studio running through Vulkan), but it does make it way easier for people who do want to run AI locally on their card to do so without any fuss.",Neutral

AMD,"That’s not really true. It’s gotten better and better with more community optimisations and presumably AMD could do a lot more.  Also much like DLSS 4.5 more options is never a bad thing. I’ve seen people with a 2080 use ultra performance mode combined with preset L to get surprisingly good image quality in path trace titles. Meanwhile, I’ve seen people with something like a 3090 TI just use preset M and brute force the image quality improvements as basically a native anti-aliasing alternative.   This is why I’m so against this AMD style of thinking where they know best or Nvidia for that matter with frame generation which now could very well run on the 20 and 30 series after they removed the need for flow rate acceleration in their new model but they haven’t done that. I’m sure there are some CPU bound games that could deliver a good experience even on the 20 and 30 series cards but because Nvidia is greedy or Nvidia thinks they know best they haven’t done that.",Positive
AMD,"The penalty is when comparing to FSR3 performance, not native render. I get 42-45 fps in cyberpunk 2k/all max/rt max/pt off and just enabling quality fsr3 gives me +30ish fps. I wouldn’t care if it gave me +20fps but actually good image quality instead",Negative

AMD,"Yeah, this is what gets me about people thinking that AMD has some ulterior motive, or that this is the work of evil big AI, or that this will eventually be forced upon users.   Out of all the AI apps listed here (not the developer tools VSCode, Python and Pytorch), all of them are freeware. 3 out of 4 of them are open source. AMD does not develop any of these apps (Amuse was sponsored, but no one's going to use that with ComfyUI available). And with the exception of Amuse, all of these originally worked on Nvidia first.  AMD does not directly benefit from people having this software on their computer in any way. All of these are for running AI locally on your own hardware. You do not pay for any cloud compute or transfer any data to AMD. They make zero money by bundling these apps for you.  So why are they doing this? It's stupid, but the point of this is to let people know that these things now work hassle free on AMD cards. One of the many things they lagged behind Nvidia in other than upscaling, ray tracing and all that was local AI.   Getting something like ComfyUI working on Nvidia was as simple as downloading it and installing it. It just worked out of the box. By comparison, getting it working on AMD was a complete pain in the ass. [They even acknowledged as such](https://youtu.be/UZHffzyyatY) in their promotional video for this.  All this was aimed to do was to let people know this is no longer the case. Was it a hamfisted, clumsy way of doing it? Totally. But this is very different from something like Microslop trying to shove in Copilot into everything.  It's opt-in, for fucks sake. My drivers automatically updated because I forgot to turn off auto update and none of these things were installed on my computer.

AMD,"My gpu, a 7900 XT has 20 GB vram and I can do, what I wrote pretty well. The 7900 XTX has 24 GB vram and the 9070 XT has ""only"" 16 GB vram. Still good enough for most of the smaller models.   I have to check it again, but from memory I got around 7 to 12 tokens per second from coding models in Lmstudio.  Amd ist not as easy to setup as Nvidia, true, but then this is just an argument for the AI bundle, right?",Positive
AMD,">Basicly only 7900xtx have above 16gb vram  I mean, realistically, what consumer GeForce cards have more than 16 GB of VRAM? It's only ever been the Titan/90 class. Sure, Nvidia does have a couple generations of it available, but these were (and are) prohibitively expensive, so it's not exactly a point against AMD. When it was still available, the 7900 XT was the cheapest card that could fit gemma3-27b-qat completely into its memory with a usable context window.  >Highly ineffective and slow.  It's really not that bad. I have a 7800 XT and with Z-Image-Turbo I can generate a 1536x2048 image in under a minute. Not as fast as an Nvidia card, sure, but still pretty damn fast for an image of that resolution. Flux.2 Klein-4b edits images in under 10 seconds for me. Would an Nvidia card make it even faster? Sure, but not faster enough to say that AMD sucks for these applications.",Neutral
AMD,My 6800xt is extremely fast for my local hosted ai as long as I keep the model below 16Gb,Positive
AMD,Isn't self-hosted severely limited and kind of stuck as you will reasonably not even have half the amount of memory available compared to commercial models? Assuming that you have at best 32GB of VRAM compared to the Nvidia AI optimized cards with 80GB of VRAM. Or is there not that much different between the smaller and larger models?,Neutral

AMD,You jest but having ROCm PyTorch finally available for Windows is big news for some,Positive
AMD,Actually yeah this update is solid for people new to local LLMs (I run ollama via Vulkan on my windows + 9060 XT 16GB rig).  I hope they tweaked the ollama install. Not all amd  cards (like mine) can use local ollama unless the environment variables tell it to use Vulkan instead of ROCm. Vanilla ollama performance like shit otherwise as it won't touch the GPU without the env vars  Edit - apparently the installer will skip ollama install if it's already installed. The ollama build that the installer installs is preconfigured to use rocm including the libraries needed. I'll have to configure some env vars manually to take advantage of it,Positive
AMD,"God yeah  Im in computer science and absolutely hate the trend of LLMs and how its feasting on resources.

AMD,"Im not a developer. I just used python for the first time the other day to make a tray icon app that tells me the last episode i opened of the show I'm watching on VLC. I always forget to make a note of the last episode i watched, so this tiny script i learned how to make is very very helpful. I'll be using python some more, just have to think of ideas.  Its really simple and just the exact thing i needed. Basically it reads VLC for file names and updates a text file with the last opened episode, and then i have a little tray icon that reads the text file and when i hover over it with my mouse, it gives me a tooltip popup ""Last Opened: The Office S05E03"". Yes, I'm watching The Office",Positive
AMD,Idk if it means installing the AMD supported version easily without hunting and building a AMD specific version I'm down,Neutral
AMD,And that's why its optional. Wild concept.,Neutral
AMD,good thing its optional,Positive
AMD,"I'm a developer too. I avoided python like the plague until now and never felt the overwhelming urge to switch to VSC. However, I suspect that I might not get very far without them if I wanted to try local AI models just for fun.  I don't even have any development tool on my home PC yet which I have completely rebuilt 3 weeks ago. Well, I guess Python is there in the WSL image I took over from the old SSD.  I completely understand that you dont want Adrenalin messing up your environment, but apparently AMD has just guessed what I needed.",Negative

AMD,"Radeon is notorious for being a tricky to get certain developement tooling (Pytorch with Rocm as far as I understand) working on - so it does somewhat make sense that AMD is the oen to push out a ""fix"" (fix being them offering to install for you so you dont have to struggle) its lousy cause the process should just be less complicated but its the quickest fix to adress peoples frustrations I suppose",Negative
AMD,"doesn't seem weird at all to me, those tools are meant to run local AI models, which need your GPU and some small configuration steps",Neutral
AMD,Could it be because GPUs are used in areas other than video games?,Neutral
AMD,A lot of developers working in AI use their graphics card to run models. This looks like a convenient way to get that set up without too much fiddling.,Positive
AMD,It's just QoL tbh,Neutral
AMD,"Not really sure what the problem is, it’s an optional download to take advantage of the GPU to do other tasks.",Neutral
AMD,Believe it or not those tools run locally on your GPU.,Neutral
AMD,The AI stuff is used by the GPU (but you can offload some processes to cpu)  Plus AMD has had a lot of issues with local gen stuff working without putting effort in.  It at least makes sense since AI is the trendy thing.,Neutral
AMD,"So like ""hey radeon, build me a calc app in python"" and then go to sleep for 8h?",Neutral
AMD,Python is one of the most popular programming languages in recent years. And VSCode is a common development environment.,Positive

AMD,"Tried it on 3 different version and it never worked. So, returned to 2.2.2.",Negative
AMD,"I know Optiscaler can, but for like 99% of people it is either the built in solution or none. To make the FP8 version run in FP16 should be relatively easy for AMD and they should at least do that. If some people want more upscaling performance then they can use Optiscaler with the INT8. Of course it will be for the best if AMD actually uses the INT8 version and also keeps the model updated in parallel with the FP8. That means maintaining 2 different main models (which in each model there are optimisations for several upscaling targets) which I doubt they will do.",Neutral
AMD,Ah yes I forgot. The mere mention of AI anywhere near people like this makes them quiver in their boots.,Negative

AMD,does this work on Z2E devices by any chance like the Legion Go 2?,Neutral
AMD,Except when given that option they try it and when it does t work they blame the company and demand they make it work,Negative
AMD,Nah.  It just won't run as well as it will on RDNA4.  AMD is being dumb by trying to keep it on RDNA4 only.  Sure isn't getting them any sales and has pissed off a whole lot of people.   Its a pretty egregious unforced error by AMD execs at this point.,Negative
AMD,I can play performance mode at 1440p in cyberpunk 2077 with all settings cranked without any noticeable artifacts on DLSS 4.5.

AMD,"Interesting, i was under the impression that if you want to run semi-usefull local AI you should atleast be in the 50-70b models for it to be 'usefull' but for tinkering its probably fun to play with. I want to buy a H100 when they become more affordable to see if I can make my own local 'jarvis'.    On the contex of the post, I don't like that everyone is trying to force AI into everything, desprate to find a niche to try and make it profitable to recoup trillions of dollars invested into AI, and that is basicly what this is from AMD.",Neutral
AMD,"I tried a couple models recently with 12GB Vram and for light tasks the models are certainly usable. Of course not as good as the latest big models, but fully local. This seems like a good way to have a quick play around with this stuff, especially the user friendly tools.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah, I'll admit that the portable install was already extremely simple (literally plug and play), but if you didn't want the portable install for some reason [it was still quite an involved process.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTp8FnT883E)",Neutral
AMD,"Not on the 9000 series GPUs as they only just got ROCm support this update, before this you had to jump through hoops to get it working or use Linux.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm not sure what other software you wanted to use, but for ComfyUI I've actually been using the Portable Install for ROCm for about a month now on my 7800 XT. Even before this AI Bundle, the Portable Install automatically set everything up for me. I downloaded it, ran the .bat, and was immediately able to start generating.  That's rough. I mean, if it's only been a week and you'd really appreciate the extra $150 bucks, you could probably still return it and buy a 9070 XT instead?  That said, you might want to keep your 5070 Ti, because there's still a few things on the local AI side that are still designed completely for Nvidia. Nunchaku quants don't work on AMD and the devs have stated they have no intention of getting it working for it, and one of the best S2T models out there right now, Nvidia's Canary, is unsurprisingly only able to run on Nvidia cards because it uses Nvidia's NeMo as one of its dependencies.",Neutral
AMD,"You don't need to install anything, the whole point of this is that it does it all for you.  What you might need to do is uninstall things. I switched over from ZLUDA to ROCm a little while back, and while it worked it was acting weird because I had an old version of ROCm (6.2.4 or something) installed along with a bunch of HIP SDKs from my ZLUDA installation. Uninstall those before you update and remove variables from PATH or things might be weird.   I can't remember everything I had to uninstall, but ask an AI like Gemini and it'll walk you through what needs to be done. That's what I did.",Neutral
AMD,It's me. I'm some. Goddamn ROCm seems to always be available for every card and environment except the ones I have.,Negative

AMD,More akin to someone growing weat in their backyard really.,Negative
AMD,"What IS wrong with it is that it completely depends on an open source piece of software that is BARELY credited. And if that wasn't bad enough, there was the whole deal with calling deepseek distils ""deepseek r1"", making people think they were actually running the original model. It's overall incredibly dumbed down, not even letting you choose the number of layers to offload or other useful llama.cpp arguments like override tensor.",Negative

AMD,you can’t use OptiScaler with anything that uses anti cheat bc you have to mod the game files to get OptiScaler working. it’s very simple modding but obvs that won’t fly regardless,Negative
AMD,"Almost because it’s a hack and not supported natively by AMD. still works better on many games on some cards. A lower FSR4 setting looks better than a higher FSR3 setting, and performs about similarly. That’s a big jump in visuals for not much performance hit. I’m going to run cyberpunk that way on my 7900XT since FSR4 is the next best thing compared to DLSS, and way better than FSR3. Even on Steam Deck there are some games that look and play better with FSR4 hacked in compared to FSR3.",Positive
AMD,"Consumer-blaming isn't the solution to late stage capitalism's problems.  Consumers can demand anything they want. The market can then decide if there is enough demand to supply a solution.

Don't know a damn thing about Pytorch because I don't develop so I'm not sure if that translates over, but if AMD is promising better native Pytorch support I'd imagine that sticking with Windows is the play for now.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah that's kinda where I'm at. I have ethical issues with Gen-AI as well, but the core of the issue is corporations trying to shove it into literally everything even when it's not wanted nor needed, all in an effort to justify the absolutely ungodly amounts of money they've burned trying to get it to where it's at now.

The recommended specs are slightly more generous than the last Lego Batman game: recommended was 4 to 5-year-old GPU's (GTX 480 and Radeon 5850), while the 3080 is nearly 6 years old.   You being uncomfortable with the passage of time has nothing to do with optimization. It's been more than a decade since the last game. Graphics improve. Not just the actual effects, but also the amount of stuff that can be rendered at once in a map.",Neutral
AMD,another unoptimized slop,Negative
AMD,"I have the explanation.  You know how everyone was begging for a return of AA games, right? Everyone was fed up of only AAAs with inflated budgets and indies? People wanted mid-budget ""AA"" games more often?   That's where Unreal Engine 5 comes in. The Monkey's Paw curls a finger.   It allows teams to make games much more quickly, and gives lower budget games the opportunity to have a much greater scope both in terms of graphics and content (e.g. Clair Obscur Expedition 33). Also just because it's Lego doesn't mean it's not going to look gorgeous. If this has Lumen, this is going to look better than Arkham Knight in terms of lighting.   But UE5 is notoriously tougher to run. That's why they don't want to underbelly how intensive the game is. Odds are, it should run fine on a lower end card. But they don't want to be complained at if it doesn't.",Neutral
AMD,NOOOOOOOO,Neutral
AMD,Minimum 3080 wow is it crysis,Neutral
AMD,The 3080 is 6 years old and the equivalent of a 5060 Ti which is a current gen mid range GPU. For such a card to appear in the recommended requirements is very reasonable if you ask me,Neutral
AMD,With requirements like that I better feel like I'm in Legoland watching a moving diorama,Neutral
AMD,Cant remember if it was in the Skywalker Saga Lego game but that shit looked amazing for it being Lego.,Positive
AMD,cant be rt or pt judging by how they put 3080 and 6800xt which are no where near comparable in that.  the game is just that fucking horridly made it seems...,Negative
AMD,But it will be *under* the system requirements…,Neutral
AMD,His won't but then mine will :(,Negative
AMD,And then it'll hit minimum sys req and that's the end of it.,Neutral
AMD,UE5 does not like my 9070 I can tell you that much,Negative
AMD,I guess the question is if the recommended spec is for 4k ultra at 120fps. Then that makes more sense.,Neutral
AMD,Yeah Unoptimized Engine 5 is the worst.,Negative
AMD,"The game I was most annoyed of is Clair Obscur. That game looks like it should scale down nicely but it doesn't. I tried to play it on a Steamdeck. Turned everything down. Turned upscaling up. It probably rendered at the same resolution as Daggerfall. Looked like it, too. And it still choked in the starting ravine. The same Steamdeck can run the famously bad PC version of Arkham Knight amd look good.   We truly need to call bad craftmanship out more.",Negative
AMD,UE5 will bring a 5080 to its knees if it does on of those close ups of a face.  What the fuck is up with that engine,Negative

AMD,Yeah I got the same card. It really isn't cutting it for the latest single player games I've noticed. Such a shame. It would've gotten more longevity if they back ported FSR4,Negative
AMD,I am at this point playing more games on my Steamdeck than on my 9070XT. One is on my couch. The other is at my workdesk.  I should have refunded that hot mess Clair Obscur immediately. It looks like it should run on a Steamdeck but it doesn't. And I have no intention to pay a game with my controller while seated at my desk.

AMD,Games stop being optimized when they can't run on the PC I built 5 years ago.,Negative
AMD,"Or when a graphics card started to appear in required specs.   Or when EverQuest released an expansion with a graphics upgrade, that recommended 256 RAM. Which found a lovely Windows bug, where versions older than XP could get lost in the RAM and freeze. Forcing the user base to need to upgrade windows",Negative
AMD,"To be fair Oblivion had a bunch of seriously stupid things going on, like massive texture files for random little prop rocks and the like. That sort of thing is very sloppy and it's not the kind of optimisation that costs anything to do. Bethesda's reputation isn't unearned.",Negative
AMD,For a bit of context on this. I had a 2 year old ATI X800 XT that couldn't run Oblivion properly. Todays equivalent would be a 4090 being only able to run a game on potato settings.,Negative
AMD,"Yeah, pretty sure most games from 2006 would struggle with a GPU from 2000. The 3080 is over 5 years old now. I just replaced my 3080 a few weeks ago with a 9070 XT.",Negative

AMD,8 year old GPUs now are much closer to modern GPUs than 8 year old GPUs were 8 years ago.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah no, this is a bad optimisation, a Lego game should run on a toaster. This is UE5 doing what it does best",Negative
AMD,"The problem is that how many factors of 2x power increase GPUs launched in that time, and also look at the CPU minimum spec which is really high compared to the old one. The older one could run on really old CPUs. The new one needs something released relatively recently. Not that this is an unfair ask but it's still high as a minimum.",Negative
AMD,"This a terrible comparison in so many ways. Much akin to people comparing gpu/cpu prices in the 00s to today.   Look, I don't expect the gtx 1080 to be running this game at ultra, but I kinda thought stuff like it would at least reach minimum requirements.    RTX 3080 recommended is crazy. Even the 5060 ti and rx 9060 XT are slightly slower.",Negative
AMD,A nearly 8 year old gpu that is more powerful than the 5060ti 16gb which isn’t even a year old…..,Neutral
AMD,"It has everything to do with optimization though, since lego games don't do bleeding edge technology graphics, besides it's 6yo high-end GPU. It's still better than 5060ti which is new gen",Positive
AMD,"It’s closer to the 5070 lol, especially the 12gb version which is only 10% or so slower than the 5070, much faster than a 5060ti.",Positive
AMD,Same with Lego Horizon on the PS5.,Neutral

AMD,Ue5 is so bad on amd cards.,Negative
AMD,Doing fine for me,Positive
AMD,"it still doesnt make sense that way in my opinion, its a frigging lego game",Negative
AMD,"> We truly need to call bad craftmanship out more.  People really want 'Indy' or 'AA' games while demanding a degree of technical excellence that even most AAA productions can't afford...  E33 made an excellent compromise to deliver on its aesthetic.  You can't do this on the same budget with a custom or older engine, or at the very least take a huge risk that it just won't work out.  It takes much bigger studios to maintainwell optimised engines with modern feature sets that are suitable for general game development, like id with its id tech engine or Ubisoft's Anvil engine.",Negative
AMD,"Comparing a 2015 game to a 2025 game is kind of weird man idk.     Clair obscure runs decently on modern hardware, I've seen people with budget rtx4050 laptops running it.",Negative
AMD,"In which sense does Clair Obscur look like it should scale down nicely? It features all the standard photorealistic graphics and characters you'd expect from a high-end 2025 release, with a large amount of natural environments. I would expect it to scale down as well as, say, MGS Delta.",Neutral
AMD,RT isn't required in 99.9%+ of available games. I'll survive without the remainder. Those devs are choosing to make their games exclusive to a small portion of the market.,Neutral

AMD,"saying Indiana Jones release was ""two years ago"" when it's 1 year and a month is diabolical",Negative
AMD,Damn. Was it really two years?,Negative
AMD,"I didn't buy it because of the RT requirements. I had a 6800XT at that time and did not even want to test it.  Having that RT as a hard requirement is one of the dumbest decisions ever. If people can't turn it off, then a big portion of gamers may not be able to run it.",Negative
AMD,"My kid's 2070 is *outraged*, *outraged, I tell you* but the kid just drops to medium or uses DLSS and he's happy.  Probably throw a 9060XT at him later this year.",Negative
AMD,"I remember buying Command and Conquer Generals only to find that I couldn't run it on my still fairly new PC. It often only took around 2-3 years for hardware to start becoming seriously obsolete.  Generals released in 2003 and required a DirectX 8.1-capable GPU with at least 32 MB VRAM. This ment it needed an Radeon 8500 or GeForce 4 from late 2001/early 2002. Radeon 7000 and GeForce 3 GPUs from 2001 were already outdated.  Those GPUs released at $299 MSRP. Adjusted for inflation, that's almost $550 today. So depending on how you want to compare prices, that's roughly on par with requiring an RTX 4060 or RTX 4070 Super for a game released in 2025.  The fact that people now believe that games requiring 7 year old hardware is a sign of declining optimisation is kind of hilarious.",Negative
AMD,"Oh heck, don't remind me about Evercrack. I was on Windows 2000 at the time with 512 MB, so didn't see that particular issue!",Negative
AMD,I've got the original big box PC version of Everquest pre expansion and the list of recommended GPUs on the back is absolutely wild. Shit you've never heard of. Diamonds and Orchids and Matroxx this that and whatever.,Positive
AMD,"dudes who be yappin about ""games aren't optimized anymore!"" don't know shit about ""unoptimized"" games. GPUs from 3+ years ago are still completely viable today but back then a GPU that's a year old would barely be able to play anything new",Negative
AMD,"I was running a Radeon 9700 when Oblivion dropped, bought it in late 2002. It was the king of the hill, I had it overclocked slightly over 9700 Pro spec.  Oblivion *killed it*. Even on ""Medium"". Even at 1024x768. FPS was below 20 at all times and dropped into single figures when refraction shaders were used.  That'd be like an AAA game today running badly on an RTX 4080 or 4090 from 2022.",Positive
AMD,Gpu improvements have heavily stagnated. The 3080 is still stronger than the 5060ti 16gb and even trails the 4070 from last gen.,Neutral
AMD,you couldnt play games maxed out on $500 graphics cards even in 2005 without framerate dips.  as for now. a $500 5060ti 16gb running dlss 4.5 at balanced 1440p looks good and hits 60+fps.,Neutral
AMD,"It's a LEGO game now set in a larger open world and the visuals absolutely look more detailed than the last Star Wars LEGO game, which was set in smaller linear environments. Open world games just take more to render then closed environments do.   Like, I dunno what else to tell you. The 3080 is almost six years old. It's aging and it's perfectly natural that older GPUs move down into the ""recommended"" spectrum.",Positive
AMD,Thank u i was panicking. Still not great,Negative
AMD,"tbh for real, a lego game shouldn't be demanding this much lol. ue5's wid for this",Negative
AMD,What would you say is closest to a 3080ti?,Neutral
AMD,The 4070 super is about the same,Neutral
AMD,"This isn't something subjective, it's verifiable. According to TPU, the 5060 Ti is only 11% slower while the 5070 is 15% faster.   The requirements talk about the 10gb variant so that's the one I'm considering.   Iceberg Tech also made a video comparing the 3080 12gb and the 5060 Ti and they seemed to be close, so the 10gb variant would be closer.   I'm sure there are more benchmarks you can lookup to verify the performance of the cards and reevaluate your understanding based on the results",Neutral
AMD,thought you were talkin about the Forza Horizon 4 expansion for a sec,Neutral
AMD,Playing Horizon with my son right now and it looks amazing.,Positive
AMD,"Me, personally, have a much better time with ue5 games than I did on the 4070.  Less stuttery",Positive
AMD,UE5 is bad on all cards,Negative
AMD,Arena Breakout Infinite is UE5. It runs in 3440x1440 at over 200fps on my 7900XTX. It's buttery smooth so to say.   UE5 runs fine on AMD cards.,Positive
AMD,"Seriously. When folks do these comparisons of older games vs. newer games, it's always games that at the time they released were technical achievements from some of the biggest studios pushing the boundaries of what was possible at the time.   That often had not only outsized budgets, but development timelines relative to what a smaller team can afford.  It's like uh, yeah, the game looks good because they put an immense amount of time and labor into bespoke assets and toolkits to achieve a specific aesthetic within the boundaries of that period's hardware. (and oftentimes not even within those boundaries, but pushing beyond them like Arkham Knight)",Neutral
AMD,I'm comparing it to that because at lowest settings it runs and looks worse than a game from 2014.,Negative
AMD,Truth. I had no issues when I had a GTX 1080 last year.,Positive
AMD,The fact you can play the majority of modern games on 10 year old hardware seems to say the opposite of the point you're making.,Negative
AMD,Yeah but you need RTX and more CUDA cores to get all the best AI copilot features,Neutral
AMD,Big part of it as well. Everything is UE5 slop nowadays.,Negative

AMD,"RT capable cards have existed for eight years, if your PC rig doesn't have one it might be time for an upgrade ngl",Neutral
AMD,the 9060xt is pretty similar speed as it lacks dlss and fsr3 looks bad (unless the game supports fsr4). 9070 or 5070 are upgrades though,Negative
AMD,"And before Steam and indie games really took off we had a period of publishers dismissing all PC gamers as pirates. That era was full of just *atrocious* ports from consoles, if the publishers even bothered at all.    It was pretty much just Valve and Blizzard holding the PC flag for a while, and Bioware was at least good about adapting their UIs for PC (tactical mode in DAO, for example).",Negative
AMD,"I had ME at the time, and after adding ram to my system, I was soft locking about every 30-45 min.",Neutral
AMD,"Not to mention that a lot of the stutters of the Oblivion remaster are not because of UE5, but because the original Oblivion code still stutters on hardware from over 15 years later.  Asset streaming in open worlds is a hard problem. We live in a blessed time to treat the occasional shader compilation stutter in UE5 games a as a major issue.",Negative
AMD,I had a vanilla GeForce 6800 which I was able to unmask some extra pixel pipelines for extra performance. Not sure if I ever played Oblivion on that though because I played it a couple years after release. I might've played it with my next build with the GeForce 9800 gt.,Neutral
AMD,It doesn’t matter how old the 3080 is. It’s not a weak gpu by any means. It’s like 10% stronger than the 5060ti 16gb and only slightly trails the 4070 for comparison.,Positive
AMD,Eh I blame developers just as much,Negative
AMD,"12gb 3080 and 3080ti are essentially the same performance, so the closest equivalent would be a base 4070 and 4070 super or 5070",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah there are a lot more advantages to the 3080(like its near 2x bus), and there are 2 variants of the 5060ti... don't know ""iceberg tech""... so wont speak to that.  When looking at either. We see that when in RT, the 3080 just smacks the crap out of the 5060ti 8Gb, and makes the 5060ti 16GB do a very good impression of the french. Only winning when it can leverage the 16GB Vram buffer, which is predominantly 4k, which is not a great res for that GPU anyway.",Neutral
AMD,"Tech power up isn’t accurate down to the perctanges like that, it’s more of a rough idea on where the perf of a card stacks up.   In real world benchmarks and game testing at 1440p/4K the 3080 is much closer to the 5070.   You even said that the 3080ti is closest to the 4070 super, which is correct. The 12gb 3080 is essentially the same thing as a 3080ti in perf, and a 4070 super is around 5070 perf too, so you basically agree with me already.",Neutral
AMD,haha. Lego Horizon Adventures to fully clarify!,Positive
AMD,"Probably able to just brute force it a bit more, I found I had a better time when I went with the x3d chip from my 12th gen i5. The stutters hit less frequently recovered much faster than the gpu upgrade",Positive
AMD,bad developers are bad on all cards* ftfy,Negative
AMD,I mean 7900 XTX is still tied for like 8th best amongst non-commercial cards.  Its kind of a beast.,Positive
AMD,"There are definitely examples of ue5 that run fine on amd cards, but there are a lot that don’t.",Neutral
AMD,Worse than a game at max settings? Well yeah. A game from 2014 at lowest also looked worse than a maxed out 2004 game. Maxed out 1440p half life 2 vs lowest settings 720p shadow of Mordor (which was considered a good looking game on release…not so much later). Half life 2 clears.  It’s been like that for a very long time. Basically ever since graphics settings.,Negative
AMD,I think we're saying the same thing? Only a small number of recent games require RT.,Neutral
AMD,"I tired RT only once on my 6800XT and that was Control. Never bothered again.   Also I play a lot on my Steamdeck a lot. Because I do not need glasses using that. Game streaming never worked for me.   I got two reasons not to get it. Both not very strong, but forced RT was an immediate turn-off so I immediately forgot about it. Maybe when it is dirt-cheap on GOG.",Negative
AMD,"And the physical hardware was so low quality.  GPU didn't even need a 12VHWPR connector to frequently fail within 2-3 years, because capacitors, coolers, PSUs, and the general build quality were so bad. [This thing was a $299 card in 2002](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce4-ti-4400.c180), and it's not like high-end cards were built much better. Even on a purely physical level, it's awesome how much better built a [modern equivalent like the 5060 is.](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-5060.c4219)  I lost 2 GPUs to those dreaded flickering polygons (afaik indicating that some memory cell or data channel had broken) just in the 3-4 or so years I was playing World of Warcraft.  Not to mention the buzzing audio because most cables and speakers broke easily. I had to weigh down the cable of my speakers to make up for a partial cable break constantly, and had buzzy sound every summer when temperatures went up.",Negative
AMD,Whoever said it's *weak*? It's now a mid-range GPU. It is *literally the recommended GPU* for this game.,Neutral
AMD,Thank you for the insight 🤝,Positive
AMD,Is HUB a big enough channel for ya? Their review puts the the 5060 Ti 11.5% behind the 3080 12gb at 1440p so within 10% of a 3080 10gb. I would not call that a smacking.   I'm not saying that the 5060 Ti is a good card or that the 3080 10gb is bad. All the comparisons I'm saying indicate that they're reasonably close to each other and that's about it,Neutral
AMD,"The post specifically mentions the 10gb variant of the 3080 though. HUB's 5060 Ti puts it 10% slower than a 4070/3080 12gb at 1440p as well, and the 10gb variant is a few percent slower.

AMD,"Oh yeh it usually runs bad, but this is Id's engine which runs amazing on amd cards generally. They did black magic to get it running smoothly. Obviously I couldn't use the path tracing mode but who cares.",Positive
AMD,"That's funny, because of course both Indiana Jones and Doom TDA at max settings run *much* better on your GPU than Control does. Because they have 'forced RT' so the games are actually built to *properly utilize* it, unlike Control which has the nice non-forced RT everyone loves - because it's bolted onto the existing engine and runs like crap. Just like *every* game that has RT bolted on runs like crap when it's enabled.",Positive
AMD,"I had one of the earlier fan cooled GPUs, and it had the bearing in the fan fail. It rattled for a bit, then the card died.   I remember all the issues with audio drivers, and it being generally recommended to have a separate sound card to get better stability for games",Negative
AMD,What I meant was the guy I was replying to says it’s perfectly natural for a 6 year old gpu to be seen in the recommended. Kinda insinuating that the 3080 is an older less powerful card that should be relegated to this status. Despite it being stronger than the less than a year old 5060ti,Neutral
AMD,"Again, what 5060ti...  You used a source. I used the exact same source. When you actually dive into the specific results, the ""12%"" average. Turns out its a lot more than 12% but occasionally the 3080 didn't run a vram parasite. You just have to open up the techpowerup results to see the details.",Neutral
AMD,Where my bro the 3070 ti? He falls right above the 7700 XT in 1080p.,Neutral
AMD,9800s only recently came out and honestly even the 5800x3d is still a premium chip. You wouldn’t be putting yourself in a bad position if you grabbed any x3d chip,Neutral
AMD,"Sure, but also it *is* an older less powerful card. It's simply relegated from a flagship status to midrange - while 5060Ti although more recent was of course midrange to begin with.",Neutral
AMD,You can't just grab a CPU and call it a day. Moving from LGA 1700 to AM4 would be monumentally stupid. He can already upgrade to CPUs equal to the 5800X3D on the existing platform.,Negative
AMD,"Of course he can, I was just on the same train of thought of I upgraded to an x3d chip.",Neutral
AMD,You upgraded to AM5 which makes sense. The 5800X3D isn't an upgrade over the best Intel CPUs.,Neutral
AMD,"The 2 builds are very solid.  However, the Intel one has more performance for 1440p games and multitasking.  But if you want something ESTRICTLY for gaming, then the AMD one can let you upgrade to a R7 9800X3D in the future.",Positive

AMD,"Not out till end of May too. Lots can happen in that time. Better to advertise higher requirements now and then lower them, then rising them later. Not to mention they might test more system combinations later. Can't say it will run on a Gen 10 processor without testing it first even if it works.",Neutral
AMD,"It actually isn't in the places that matter regarding hardware requirements, it's an Unreal Engine 3 game(AK) vs an Unreal engine 5 one(new lego batman).  Graphically and stylistically AK is of course far better than the new lego batman, but the techniques and technologies used for developing and present in the new lego game are far more demanding than the ones in AK.  For example, baked lighting can look as good as ray tracing, or even better in some cases, but ray tracing demolishes performance specially when the resolution goes above 1080p, while baked lighting is far less demanding and was the previous standard. If i'm not mistaken, AK uses baked lighting while the new lego batman uses ray tracing.  Higher hardware requirements don't mean more complexity in gameplay/scope or higher fidelity necessarily, higher hardware requirements simply mean more demanding tech in use and/or less optimization.",Neutral
AMD,Also it’s coming to switch 2 so relatively it’s not that power compared to pc hardware so I’m not worried about the system requirements being too high.,Neutral
AMD,no whats better to do is to not say them at all and use TBD or TBA like every other game all this will do is hurt pre order sales and what not if u actually believe this was placeholder im sorry but ur an idiot they only claimed it was a placeholder after they got a bucket load of shit thrown at them this was never placeholder,Negative

AMD,"This thing is absolutely nuts  AMD BTFO unironically, I'm floored. I never, ever would have considered an Intel chip before 2025, now this is the most obvious laptop part ever. AMD is surely sorely regretting recycling the same 780M and 890M chips for another entire gen, betting that Intel would continue stagnating.  This thing is gonna be a monster in handhelds.  I really, really wanted a Strix Halo laptop, but the lack of SKUs, price and the inflexibility with RAM kind of make it unappealing to say the least, not to mention the power draw compared to Panther Lake is unwelcome. These laptops are gonna be probably the best x86 in mobile has eaten in a very long time.  On top of that, it's almost making the 5050 look like a stupid part in a laptop.

The ultra H 300 has default TDP of 25W, with Maximum Turbo Power (MTP) going up to 65W-80W. Intel has a better design, if they threw 40 XeSS3 cores on it, it would prolly run circles around Strix.",Neutral

AMD,"Bingo  Strix is also limited by being RDNA 3.5 and no FSR4, so it's rather dependent on raw throughput, and it can't possibly fit in a comfortable handheld that would last for more than an hour and a half under load.  I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage. I hope they keep it up, it would really be cool to see an AMD vs Intel APU console war generation.",Neutral
AMD,It's about 50% bigger die with 1 CCD (which seems comparable CPU performance),Neutral
AMD,"This is a big of exaggeration, as you can see with Nvidia moving to gddr7. While bandwidth has increased substantially, performance is clearly limited by lack of compute power",Negative
AMD,">GPU's will take all the bandwidth you can feed them.   Didn't deny that. But 12 Xe cores is presumably considered the sweet spot, that's all I'm saying. And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.  Besides, Intel already has Nova Lake AX in the backlog, or whatever it's going to be called. Practically intel's strix halo. It'll have Xe3P cores, more powerful than Xe3, thus deemed more worthy of the halo treatment.",Neutral
AMD,"No official confirmation yet, but JayKihn leaked the tile size for the 12Xe SKU last year. Another user somewhere else said the 4Xe GPU is 33mm2.   https://x.com/jaykihn0/status/1812898063502938260   And even without the PHYs and NPU, from what I see, Halo's GPU tile is still like almost 3 times as big.

AMD,"Halo's die is still quite a bit bigger, but from the Intel side, you need to include IO, GPU and about half of the compute die which has the MCs, encoders / decoders, etc. to match the ""GPU"" die of Halo, so it is more like 200mm² to 300mm² when compared",Neutral

But all I need to know is it's faaar bigger.  >panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus  That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.",Neutral
AMD,"Well Panther uses mixed processes, and hybrid tiles are bound to be a bit less space efficient than putting everything on a single die. And to be fair, Halo GPU uses N4P process while Panther GPU uses N3E So, still not directly comparable.   Gotta say though, Arc's PPA has improved a lot since Alchemist and Battlemage.",Neutral
AMD,"> That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.  Yeah, it doesn't matter how much memory bandwidth you have if the GPU doesn't have the raster performance to keep up with the flow of data. Case and point, AMD's R9 Fury X. Released with 4096bit bus HBM. Had a total memory bandwidth of 512GB/s. Yet the GTX 980 Ti released with a 384bit bus and 336GB/s memory bandwidth and it out performed the Fury X in pretty much everything.

Exception is the Ultra 9 where they just do it with vPro support as standard.  These have a higher cost because you are getting more features.  You could make it so you just have one CPU and then the manufacturer pays a license for corporate firmware per device, but that's more work to then ensure manufacturers are licensing machines correctly, and more confusing for end-users where now if you're buying a corporate device with vPro support you know you are looking at Core Ultra 236V and 268V for vPro support whilst 226V and 258V don't have it.",Neutral

As of right now only the ending 8 differentiates the 338H from the small-GPU SKUs, which IMO is not clear enough.

They don't care if ARL on paper or on theory is some great reset. Perf, power, and cost is what's important.   >he 285K is suffering from the acute growing pains of decoupling the compute complex from the uncore in a way that creates a distinct latency penalty that enthusiasts are mistaking for regression.  It's not being ""mistaken"" for a regression, it quite literally is one.   The problem is also that AMD also has disaggregated their compute from their IMC, and yet has *better* latency on *less advanced* packaging.   >The controversy here isn't that Intel failed to push frequency; it is that they deliberately chose to execute a hard pivot away from the monolithic brute force strategy of Raptor Lake to a disaggregated chiplet design that prioritizes area efficiency and performance-per-watt over raw, latency-sensitive throughput.  Nothing about ARL's current design prioritizes ppw or area efficiency over RPL's design from a chiplets vs monolithic perspective. ARL isn't enabling higher core counts from going chiplets, that seems to be left to NVL according to rumors. And chiplets carries an area penalty over monolithic designs anyway.   >The removal of Hyper-Threading from the Lion Cove P-cores is the most contentious yet logically sound decision engineers could have made given the thermal constraints of modern silicon.   This makes no sense   >By removing the simultaneous multithreading logic, specifically the duplication of architectural state and the complexity required in the reorder buffers and schedulers to handle two threads, Intel was able to physically widen the core and increase the L2 cache per core to 3MB without blowing up the die size  SMT costs Zen 5 less than 5% in area btw. Just throwing that out there.   >The result is a P-core with significantly higher IPC than Raptor Cove  It's not though. This has been a significantly worse ""tock"" in terms of IPC uplift compared to something like SNC or GLC.   >but this raw single-threaded throughput is being masked by the interconnect latency.  Maybe gaming or some benchmarks are, but for the large part, no.   You can see this two ways, LNC's structural gains (core width, ROB capacity, etc etc) have smaller gains, percentage wise, over their predecessor versus something you would see in GLC vs SNC, or SNC vs SKL.  And also LNL's uncore is dramatically improved over ARL, and yet you see the same unimpressive IPC gains over MTL/RWC (which is the basis for ARL's mid mem fabric).   >the architectural overhead of the Foveros packaging means that ring bus latency is higher.

AMD,"AMD had a very similar experience with their first generation of Ryzen CPUs. One of the differences here is Intel had a competitive product prior to their architectural shakeup. Had Intel totally croaked for years and not been competitive in the CPU space the narrative would be completely different and everyone would be singing their praises.  Aside from that I think the biggest problem with this new architecture is simply there's little reason to buy in. It was only recently (if memory serves, I could be wrong on this) announced that the next generation of CPUs will share this platform and later ones will be on a new socket. When AM4 was announced we knew that it would persist for multiple generations and now with AM5 - why would you buy a board that will be obsolete when its time to upgrade when you could buy into a platform that will support your next 1-2 CPUs?

AMD,"IMO corrupt tech sites and tech YouTubers are behind ARL’s failure for two reasons.   The first: AMD MCM processors without 3D cache are bad for gaming, and it’s hard to find this information in 90% of charts to warn intel about the consequences of going down this path, even though they should have done their own tests and experiments.   The second: in my own tests, the 265K was 15% faster than the 9700X on launch BIOS. Through BIOS updates, that gap extended to 20%, making it only 7%-10% slower than the 14700K. Yet on some very questionable charts, the 265K is shown as slower than the 9700X.   For experienced users, RPL CPUs’ temperatures can be lowered by 20°C by turning Hyper-Threading off and undervolting. For inexperienced users, ARL is better, as it runs 20°C cooler out of the box.   I believe that in 2026 we deserve raw, unedited video benchmarks that start from the desktop, show full system specs, then enter game-by-game benchmarking—no more charts with zero evidence to back them up.   When I tried to confront HUB with my benchmarks, I got blocked to cover up their lies and corruption. If they truly cared about which CPU is faster, they would share their in-game benchmark scores and discuss them in a scientific way, but that’s not their goal. The numbers go up and down for the highest bidders.   Lastly, I believe Nova Lake, with its expected 144 MB cache, will be faster than Zen 6 X3D by 10–20% as 9700x in real world is 20% slower than 265k and if both got the same IPC uplift NL will end up on top.

AMD,"285K seems to have fantastic workstation performance, I didn't think much before selecting Intel over AMD parts for work to be honest, considering the efficiency gains. We landed on 265K, it benches very favorably compared to AM5 parts in nearly every workload except for gaming, and even then, that's mostly the X3D parts, and even then, that's when there is virtually no GPU bottleneck.   Most initial ""gaming"" reviews were done exclusively with 5090s, which is extremely unrealistic for most gamers and gave an extremely false impression that you would see a massive uplift by buying this part compared with the alternative CPU parts in gaming.   A lot of reviewers such as HUB have done a lot of work to correct this impression with a variety of testing scenarios and explaining their reasoning behind removing the GPU limiting factor as much as possible in benchmarks. Incidentally, these reviews typically showed that anything less than a 5080 sees virtually no benefit with a 9800X3D versus, say, a 9700X, and incidentally the two parts that saw no discernible benefits were the Radeon 9070XT and the 9070.  Obviously, if you have a 5090 and an unlimited budget with price being no factor, your best bet for top tier performance in all categories is a 9950X3D, but that just isn't what most people are looking at.  I myself bought into the future proofing mentality with my CPU and bought a 9800X3D, and ironically bought another AMD Radeon 9070XT to pair it with, a GPU that seems literally no performance gain compared to a 9700X, let alone a 285K. The same 285K that takes a dump all over the 9800X3D in nearly every other productivity benchmark.  I guess the good news is that when I upgrade my GPU in 2-4 years, at least I'll take advantage of the 9800X3D in games, lol. But considering it cost me over $900 for CPU, RAM, and motherboard, that's cold comfort.

AMD,"I suspect they just didn't have enough time to change anything. MTL releasing in Dec 2023, internal testing I'm sure yielding some set of data, and external reviews giving other feedback, even by the release of MTL, ARL has probably been in the pipeline for years and probably locked into certain design choices regardless of the feedback and testing.  Additionally I suspect that on mobile chips/laptop gaming rigs there's less focus on each individual part because  a) few people hardcore game on laptops b) the latency can be blamed on other things since laptops are a prepackaged consortium of parts and it's harder to isolate, and  c) therefore laptops tend to be evaluated as a whole rather than the individual pieces that comprise them.   Therefore the ""latency issues"" only became a massive kerfuffle when the offending cpu could be isolated and tested alone, and reviewers needed something to complain about.   That's even if Intel was considering latency as the issue everyone made it out to be. Intel could have looked at it and considered the latency worth the cost to improve in other areas and serve as intels seminal desktop entry utilizing disaggregated silicon. Then gamers came and lost their shit that the newest Intel chip deprioritized something that impacted their precious fps- even though the impact was ""the new one is approximately the same to maybe a little worse as last gen in most games"".   Notwithstanding the fact that the 200 series chips retain healthy gen-to-gen perf uplift and a _massive efficiency improvement_ in productivity and general computing, and boosting the NGU and D2D clocks (which are _very_ low from the factory, and can be done with the app that Intel _has specifically designed for tuning their chips_ and is freely available (XTU)) brings the gaming performance to ""approximately the same to a little better in most games"". Contrary to what some people may think these chips are not solely or even majority used for gaming and there are other use cases Intel can to think about/chose to prioritize.   To be fair, gamers and tech enthusiasts are the ones who will care the most and therefore have a disproportionately large impact on the kind of publicity the chip will get. So, was this intels smartest PR decision? Maybe not. But I think it was still a sound engineering decision, regardless of whether or not they had feedback or data on the issue, even if it didn't go over very well with their loudest customer base.  And this is all overshadowed by the fact that if you stuck even the most hardcore of gamers on a blind trial and told them to identify what kind of chip they were gaming on, I have a hard time believing any of them would be able to tell with any certainty which is which.   Once you get to 60 fps, the vast majority of people stop caring. Whats five fps going to do to radically change your gaming experience so much that it's unplayable? Which brings me back to one of my original points: If you care _that much_, you can go spend your money _elsewhere_.",Neutral

AMD,"Let me explain why it will not degrade my CPU.  1. **TVB (Thermal Velocity Boost) is disabled when I set the turbo limit.** 2. **Current is not the issue.** First, even Intel chips were failing at idle. Second, you stated that ""the same power limit at lower voltage necessarily means more current."" That is incorrect, if it drew more current, then why does lowering voltage reduce power consumption? Have you missed basic physics? 3. **CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve.** The main issue was that either the CPU or the motherboard was supplying excessive voltage, or the CPU was requesting too much. Higher voltage is required for extreme single-core boosts, such as 5.9 GHz. This is why i3 and i5 CPUs were not affected. When I limit my boost and apply an undervolt, the CPU no longer requests high voltage. It might request slightly higher voltage for 5.5 GHz, but that is nowhere near the voltage required for a 5.9 GHz boost. 4. **The same principle applies.**  Its seems you are a failure of high life form.   Maybe read here more. it was already to high voltage   [https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop-Instability-Root-Cause/post/1633239](https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop-Instability-Root-Cause/post/1633239)  Maybe you havent read much. if you undervolted only using AC/DC loadline and didnt limit max frequency.

I think maybe you forget that AMD had to offload global foundries, I don't think anyone even blinked when that happened and it's likely because that was a different era.   My post had nothing to do with the bailout versus architecture (or saving it) , apart from mentioning that I don't believe as a consumer I should feel motivated to buy Intel over AMD, or any other American firm, at the moment.   To be very clear, as this is personal for you, I do own Intel equipment including an Arc graphics setup for one of my children. I'm not anti-Intel or anti-American at all.   I know the history between AMD and Intel fairly well. Oversimplifying, AMD as it is doesn't exist without Intel. AMD only grew because they were the most successful second source producer for Intel, and the most successful at riding the thin grey line between patient infringement and unique implementation of similar IP that kept them alive while everyone else in the X86 space either died or became irrelevant to the consumer or enterprise space. After Itanium, the story levels out with both companies becoming effectively unwilling AMD64 codependents, and I'm saying that humorously.   Intel would gladly own the X86 market outright. So would AMD. At the end of the day, we need the two driving innovation through competition. Even if the CHIPS Act, the government stock acquisition, and the nVidia partnership are solely aimed at bringing more, needed, chip manufacturing to the US, it could create a situation where that amount of leverage puts Intel into a hyper dominant position again in the near future.

Broadwell-E and early Skylake also weren’t great for OC.   -Once the node matured, things improved again. Coffee Lake (refined 14nm) made 5 GHz relatively easy. The same pattern repeats with 10nm: Alder Lake (12th gen) came after Tiger Lake and could already reach ~5 GHz, while Raptor Lake pushed clocks even higher, up to ~5.7 GHz.

AMD,Nvidia is at least some what believable. AMD though?,Neutral
AMD,"I thought that too. At least they'd have some money coming in. But apparently it takes years to rejig the plants to churn out RAM instead of CPUs. And they're heavily invested in getting the next gen CPU fabs working.   Pivoting to RAM just doesn't make sense, unless they magic'd up a new type of RAM that's cheap to make and has super low latency - which is one thing I've always thought they ought to do.

Yup, and to make it even more obvious, the same graph also has Intel 14A showing up early 2026, and 20/18A showing up at the start of 2023*,* so clearly it's not the date of when the node is going to come out (or even start HVM).",Neutral

AMD,That crazy amount of cash being spent by Pat is what enabled 18A and 14A. They HAD to buy multuple $250M Litho machines from ASML in order to make that possible. Pat was playing catch up after years of under-investment by Swan and Krzanich. It was necessary and LBT is getting the credit. You don't appear to understand the lead times required in the semi industry. Pat understood that. The mistakes Pat made were trying to build a fab in Ohio and not cutting headcount and getting rid of dead weight sooner.,Neutral
AMD,The thing intel is doing rn is literally pat's groundwork isn't it?,Neutral
AMD,Still a tall order imo unless it's some defense chip for RAMP-C,Neutral
AMD,"If they're following industry standards I'd say it depends on how good AMD's next gen is. Intel doesn't need direct access to AMD designs to etch chips for them, and designers make way more than per wafer than foundries do.  If AMD has superior designs to intel again they could finally ship out some damn chips for laptop OEMs. It would hurt intel more than the revenue would benefit them imo since client has really been carrying intel for the last six years and demand for AMD chips has been high despite the drip feed of strix chips. honestly I'm considering an AIO/NUC/whatever the new name is with strix halo and unified LPDDR5 to upscale old footage without having to use my daily desktop. imagine if it was available at scale.",Neutral
AMD,"they don't have to make faster ram, just make it, right now, some ppl don't really care about speed",Negative
AMD,"So, risk production in late 27/early 28 and HVM in 2029 I suppose?",Neutral
AMD,YEs it is. He did make mistakes. He was hiring like crazy at the beginning of his term. And he should have started cutting sooner. But he doubled down on EUV lithography and tried to get orders in for the most advanced litho machines ASML made before TSMC started buying those machines. This is why 18A and 14A even exist at Intel.,Negative
AMD,"Nothing they're doing *right now* is a success story. Remember that they don't actually have customers, and that is first and foremost what got Gelsinger fired. As things stand, the foundry as a whole is a failure. If things turn around, that will have to be under Lip Bu.",Negative
AMD,I wasn’t aware 14A is part of the RAMP-C initiative. I thought it was only Intel 16 & 18A that are currently covered by RAMP-C?,Neutral

AMD,"> But he doubled down on EUV lithography and tried to get orders in for the most advanced litho machines ASML made before TSMC started buying those machines. This is why 18A and 14A even exist at Intel.  No, that was just more wasted money. 18A doesn't even use the high-NA machines Intel bragged so much about.

AMD,It can expand in future ? My point is how can we believe such stuff at face value without actual proof.,Neutral
AMD,14A does use the High-NA machines. They didn't buy them with no plan to use them That would be stupid.,Negative
AMD,"no it wasnt. GPU's are surpassing cpu's eventually if not now.  a major part of amds success  was buying radeon all those years ago. when intel realized how utterly shortsighted they had been, they pushed arc heavy even though it wasnt going to succeed that well.  this was the right choice, as otherwise they would look like a dinosaur.",Neutral
AMD,"It can expand in the future but this is a trial, it’s not yet a long term commitment until the outcome of the project is known (final evaluation won’t be until 2026/2027). 14A is not part of RAMP-C, it’s still in phase III trial with 18A. There’s been no additional RAMP-C design calls via NSTXL that I’m aware of",Neutral
AMD,"> 14A does use the High-NA machines. They didn't buy them with no plan to use them  They bought the very first high-NA machines, claiming it was for 18A. Now they won't be used until a node that hits volume in '28/'29, by which point TSMC will have (or rather, already has) much better machines. So what exactly was the point?  > That would be stupid.  Is that not a perfectly apt description for Intel's foundry strategy in recent years? It sounds like they really drunk the coolaid with their attempts to blame the 10nm failures on the lack of EUV.",Negative

AMD,I just wanted arc to succeed 😔,Negative
AMD,did you buy one? I have owned two. A A750 and now a B580. They are great cards for the price paid. I'd like to upgrade to a B60 PRO. 24GB VRAM sounds amazing especially for $600. but I can't find one in stock anywhere.,Positive
AMD,"The fact 890M is that much faster than 140V shows this benchmark is terrible anyway. In real gaming performance, 140V performs very close to 890M and does so at usually superior efficiency.",Negative
AMD,Is panther lake on the intel process considered better perf than lunar lake on tsmc process? Or is it lateral,Neutral
AMD,I hope it comes to desktop CPUs,Positive
AMD,Almost 7600m performance ie stream machine. From a igpu . Hoping a handheld with this igpu under 1000usd,Positive
AMD,"yeah it says   ""We should also make it clear that these benchmarks seem to undermine the performance of Intel's Xe2 architecture. The Arc 140V is shown much slower than the Radeon 890M, but in reality, it ends up close to or faster in actual games. So it looks like this benchmark suite is not optimized for older Arc GPUs, but the new Arc Xe3 architecture is doing well, and we can see further improvement once the finalized drivers roll out.""",Negative
AMD,Yeah this headline doesn't add up based on my own testing,Negative
AMD,Yeah that's a strange result. Makes me think the 16% will be for PL improvement over LL.,Negative
AMD,"So imagine how much faster it is in actual practice.  These iGPUs Intel are putting out are great, it's a good time for lower-power handhelds!  And insane power handhelds too, with Strix Halo getting in them, the Ryzen 388 (8c16t with 40CU iGPU) allegedly coming, and I'm sure Intel is working on an answer to Strix Halo which if it uses this kind of uArch, will probably be deadly.  Good friggin times.",Positive
AMD,concur  some benchmarks are biased,Negative
AMD,lateral,Neutral
AMD,If it’s just “16% faster than 890m” it’s nowhere close to 7600m. You have to be over twice as fast as the 890m.,Negative
AMD,"Isn't 140T also faster than 140V in benchmarks, despite being Xe+?",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah the 388 makes a lot of sense, a worthy sacrifice of a cpu tile for cheaper more efficient gaming cpu.",Positive
AMD,Answer to strix halo was the partnership with nvidia,Neutral
AMD,Did is you see the link? Passmark graphics score? 10999 for 7600m and 9500 for b390.,Neutral
AMD,"since the 140T has 20 watts for the GPU itself, how can it be otherwise?",Neutral
AMD,"I feel like the partnership was an answer to a much broader question concerning both companies, none of it really being an implicit answer to Strix Halo beyond a vague promise to develop custom chips with Intel cores and RTX cores fuse together using nvlink.     I mean, if they actually launch something, cool. But as of now, we don't really have any information that directly points to a competing product.      In fact, I might be crazy but I feel like it is more likely that the actual answer to Strix Halo will be all Intel silicon, because Nvidia is very horny for all things ai and all things datacenter.",Neutral
AMD,"I mean no offense, but Passmark is irrelevant.  Even comparing the 890m to the 7600m (non-xt), the 7600m is usually twice as fast, with dips down to ~60% faster, and lifts up to ~170% faster.     NoteBookCheck has an extremely robust dataset of benchmarks in games for both the 890m and the 7600m (non-xt) at various resolutions, and they show not only a clear winner, but a very large difference in the performance of these devices.      Now I'm not trashing what the B390 will be, because we need an iGPU fight here.  But thinking that the 7600m (non-xt) is only ~15.7% faster than the B390 ((new-old)/old gives percent change) because of Passmark is erroneous.",Neutral
AMD,">I feel like the partnership was an answer to a much broader question concerning both companies, none of it really being an implicit answer to Strix Halo beyond a vague promise to develop custom chips with Intel cores and RTX cores fuse together using nvlink.  They explicitly talk about a client product that will have Intel cores and Nvidia iGPU tiles. It's not especially vague.   >In fact, I might be crazy but I feel like it is more likely that the actual answer to Strix Halo will be all Intel silicon, because Nvidia is very horny for all things ai and all things datacenter.  Despite that, Nvidia has already provided a custom iGPU tile for their Mediatek + Nvidia iGPU solution.   They have both the resources and financial incentive to do this. Plus, this should be better than any all intel silicon solution anyway.",Neutral

Most of the reason a laptop is “slow” is bloatware and has nothing to do with the cpu choice anyway.  And Intel is already “beating” AMD in laptop cpu sales, by a substantial margin.

Yes AMD is handily winning there.",Neutral

I work in tech for years, not an expert in laptops area but I can assure you that new CPUs from Intel that I mentioned earlier are way, way, way better than previous generations.",Positive
AMD,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works. It's like the 2001 Toyota of the laptop world, it's not winning prizes for looks, but it'll never die, gets good mileage (battery life), and is easily repairable. Maybe not the laptop you want, but definitely the one you need (excluding people who need something like a dedicated GPU or really need super high CPU performance).",Positive

AMD,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good. It seems the Intel chip was designed to be very efficient during periods of downtime and something like viewing a PDF or editing a document has a LOT of downtime for the CPU",Positive

AMD,"if you think you're 100% correct - go out and buy an x3d and run the tests, post a video with the results, and put an amazon affiliate link in the comments for a 14700k build that overall is better than an x3d.  there's nothing wrong with the 14700k, it's a beast. i think there's a few select games where it even beats the 7800x3d. but there's a reason that you can find hundreds of youtube channels with sub counts up and down the spectrum from 0 subs to 10M subs showing hardware side by sides with the x3d's beating the 14700k - and most of them don't have advertisers to please.  in my opinion, you're getting downvoted because you don't want to provide proof, you're out here saying it's tech tubers fault that you have no proof. you can also find a good amount of open source benchmark data at openbenchmarking.org, it's not pretty - but there's useful data there as well.  but hey - you're only hurting yourself by not breaking open the youtube techfluencer conspiracy around AMD processors. go buy an x3d, do all the testing, and use it as a springboard to free us from the lies of big tech. i'd love for you to be correct, but until you can provide proof, it honestly just looks like you have buyers remorse with your 14700k.",Neutral

AMD,"I sell PC hardware and get to test a wide range of components. I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance. I’ve shown full system specs and game settings every time, and provided more evidence than any tech site or tech YouTuber ever has, yet some people are still in denial.

AMD,"Two things can be true at the same time. Arrow lake has legitimately improved since it launched last year, and Intel is portraying it in the best, most optimal light they can that is probably not representative of a broad spectrum of games reviewed by a third party.   It would be interesting to get a retest of arrow lake now, but I dunno if it is worth the time investment for some reviewer like TPU or HWUB to re-review a relatively poor platform that’s already halfway out the door.",Positive
AMD,"Arrow Lake performs quite well at general compute and power efficiency compared to prior generatons ans even against AMD.  Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU. Ironically the 9070 performance was identical with a 9700X and a 9800X3D.  So it's actually kind of the reverse, gaming reviewers painted Arrow Lake in the worst possible light.",Neutral
AMD,What do you mean by gaslighting in this case?,Negative
AMD,"The answer depends on whether or not you're a ""next-gen AI gamer"" (apparently that means 1080p avg fps with a RTX 5090).",Neutral
AMD,I doubt they would give false numbers. Those are probably what you get with the setup they list in fine print. Also they pretty clearly show the 3dx parts are faster in gaming. But they have probably picked examples that show them in a good light.   There is nothing wrong per se in the arrow lake lineup. In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all. The issue that destroyed the image of arrow lake is that the previous generation was often faster in gaming. That made every reviewer give it bad overall reviews.,Neutral
AMD,Wait till refresh comes out in December... Memory latency lower and performance boosted. Price also lower... Wish it could come to the old chips but it architecturally cant. :(,Negative
AMD,"generally they cherry pick, so maybe the demo they use is process heavy with minimal I/O (arrow's biggest performance hit is memory movement). if you manage to keep memory movement low core performance is actually really good on arrow lake. it just gets massacred by d2d and NGU latency, which they don't get a pass for but its unfortunate that decent core designs are held back severely by packaging.",Negative

AMD,"As a real world example, I upgraded my primary system from a 14700k to a 265k recently.

That is not in windows, but my os which does not have thread director or custom scheduling for e cores. (So going to be worse than windows or Linux)   All the numbers except the 7900 are with the same ssd, psu, custom water loop.  The motherboard and cpu changed between Intel builds and the 3950x was the previous build before the 14700k.   The e core performance significantly improved in arrow lake.  It’s now keeping up with 16 core am4 parts in the worst possible scenario for it.  If the scheduler was smarter, I think it would be very close to the 7900.   In windows, it’s pretty close in games I play on frame rate to the old chip. A few are actually faster.",Neutral

AMD,The ones with similar pricing not performance,Negative
AMD,"True, except AM5 supported all cpus 7000, 9000 and will support the newest one. So not exactly true per se, because you need a new motherboard every time and those on AM5 can upgrade cpu without buying a board. Imagine if someone was on 13400F and wanted to buy lets say 285K? Well, you need a new board. So it depends what “cheaper” is seen as.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep. We all see the patterns here. Gamers nexus, HUB, LTT and most big name they all keep mocking Intel, even when Intel did good job to bring improvements to their products like fixing Arrow Lake gaming performance but those ""tech reviewer"" decided to be blind, they don't even want to revisit Intel chip and benchmark it, they don't even want to educate their viewers.    At the same time they keep overhyping Amd products to the moon like they own the stock, it's obvious now who is the real reviewer and who is fraud reviewer using their own popularity and big headline to spread their propaganda for their own benefits.

The fact that you can go from a 1700x to a 5800x3d on the same mobo for 85% more performance is crazy good value. You can say that all you want but there's a reason why in the diy market everyone is buying amd over intel. People know arrow lake is doa where as am5 actually has a future, which is why everyone is flocking to the 9800x3d in droves.  Zen 7 is rumored to be on am5 as well. Meaning that am6 would come out in 2030/2031. If that's true am5 lived for around 8/9 years.  That's insane value to get out of one socket.",Positive

AMD,"I agree with you, it’s daft, no doubt about it. But you’ve got to factor in that people can be daft too. Most tend to skimp, only to end up buying another middling CPU the following year, and then again after that. And so the cycle trundles on.  When I buy PC parts, I usually go for the best available. Provided the price is reasonably sane. I picked up a 9900K seven years ago and it’s still holding its own. Is it on par with the 9800X3D? Of course not. But it’s still a very capable bit of kit. Next time I upgrade, I’ll go top shelf again.",Neutral

Since then, I’ve been experiencing intermittent no-POST issues, especially after gaming sessions.   To get it to boot, I always have to adjust the screws on the AIO head. If it’s too tight: no POST.

AMD,"Intel ARC b580 apparently unable to run games in the snowdrop engine, but in such a way that it's almost impossible for benchmarkers/testers to catch.  I've been trying to run Avatar Frontiers of Pandora on my arc b580 for over a year now, and I keep having the same extremely unusual crash.  If I freshly reinstall the game, or change my operating system, or switch arc driver version, I can play the game normally, at regular framerates, with no issues, for around an hour. MAYBE two if I'm lucky.   The game then crashes, with seemingly no trigger. No thermal issues, no unusual resource usage, no memory leak, no framerate issues, no stuttering, not even a crash report. The game will just close as if I had closed it manually.   I don't crash in the same location every time, it crashes with different game settings, xess enabled/disabled, different monitors, different ram configurations. I can have the framerate capped or uncapped. GPU maxed out or not, power draw high or low. I can't consistently recreate the crash in the same way every time. The only certainty is that it WILL crash eventually.  After crashing once, It will then crash on game launch, every single time. The game opens, the epilepsy warning flashes up for a second or two, and then the game crashes in the same way, with no freeze, no crash report, just the game closing.  Since the game runs fine for an hour or so after I first install it, any benchmarker testing the gpu will likely never see the crash, because they install the game, run benchmarks, do their tests, and then close it before seeing anything wrong.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and have NOT worked.  * Updating graphics drivers (to both the latest absolute driver, and latest WHQL certified driver). * Downgrading graphics drivers (going all the way back to the first game ready drivers for the b580). * Updating windows (latest windows 10 and latest windows 11 versions). * Running a memory diagnostic * Enabling/disabling XMP. * Verifying integrity of game files. * Forcing the game to run in the Vulkan engine instead of snowdrop. * Performing a complete reinstall of the game. * Replacing one of the .dll files with a ""repaired"" one. (this apparently fixed a crash for some people). * Forcing the game to boot in dx11 instead of dx12.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and HAVE worked.  * Running the game on my AMD integrated graphics.  Obviously running the game on an igpu doesn't offer playable performance, but the game will run, and I've yet to find any crash, even leaving the game open for several hours.  Due to this issue, I'm on the verge of selling my b580 and replacing it with a different card from another manufacturer that hopefully won't have the same issue.  Has anyone had a similar issue and knows the fix? Although I suspect the issue has to be resolved with a driver update.",Negative

AMD,"Hello, I'm experiencing an intermittent but severe system hard freezes on a prebuilt PowerSpec G441 desktop purchased from Micro Center 2 years ago. The freezes occur during gaming, mixed workloads (gaming + video playback), remote desktop usage (TeamViewer), and occasionally shortly after logging into Windows with no workload running.  When my PC hard freezes:  \- Mouse is unresponsive  \- Keyboard is unresponsive  \- No audio sound  \- No BSOD or error message     My PC does not recover and requires a manual power button reboot.  After a forced reboot, Windows loads normally and allows me to log in but the system may freeze again within 1–2 minutes, even at idle. Other times, the system may run normally for days before the issue reappears.  No relevant error logs are generated at the time of the freezes. Event Viewer only shows Kernel Power events related to the forced shutdown.  So far I've tried all possible solutions to resolve my issue:  \- Updated motherboard BIOS to the latest available version  \- Updated Windows 11 fully and also reinstalled Windows 11 through USB  \- Performed clean GPU driver reinstallations  \- Verified CPU and GPU temperatures (normal under load)  \- Ran hardware stress tests and diagnostics (CPU, GPU, memory, storage) and no failures detected  \- Tested each monitor individually (dual monitor setup)  \- Swapped HDMI/DisplayPort cables and ports  \- Tested my PC without background applications  \- Returned my PC to stock settings (no overclocks, no undervolts, no XMP changes beyond default)  I've also took my pc to a local repair shop, which they could not reproduce the issue but suggested it may be CPU or PSU related issue. However, when I took my PC to Micro Center, technicians ran similar diagnostics and stress tests but were also unable to reproduce the freezes. They have also tested the PSU voltages and it passed.

AMD,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Neutral

AMD,"u/hus1030  The mounting pressure from your AIO cooler can directly affect whether the system successfully completes POST. When the cooler is tightened too much, it can cause the CPU or motherboard to bend slightly, which may lead to poor or lost contact between the CPU and the socket pins. This prevents the processor from initializing properly, resulting in a no-POST condition. Installing a contact frame changes the pressure distribution compared to the stock retention mechanism, so overtightening the AIO screws can amplify this issue. On the other hand, if the screws are too loose, the CPU temperatures will rise because the cooler is not making proper thermal contact. To avoid these problems, ensure the AIO screws are tightened evenly in a cross pattern and do not exceed the manufacturer’s torque specifications. If the issue persists, you may need to verify that the contact frame is correctly installed or temporarily revert to the original retention bracket to rule out pressure-related problems.",Neutral

AMD,"u/Any_Information429 Your HP EliteBook 830 G8 is experiencing boot issues due to corrupted Intel Management Engine (ME) firmware, which is a critical low-level system component that manages hardware initialization. This corruption is causing the blinking caps lock light, multiple restart attempts before successful boot, and the extended Windows startup times you've been experiencing. The BIOS showing ""ME Firmware Mode: Recovery Mode"" confirms this diagnosis. Since these issues began after your recent repair, it's likely that the Management Engine chip connections were disturbed or the firmware became corrupted during the service process.  To resolve this, you need to perform a forced recovery of the ME firmware by downloading the specific firmware version for your EliteBook model from HP's support website-[HP EliteBook 830 G8 Notebook PC Software and Driver Downloads | HP® Support](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/hp-elitebook-830-g8-notebook-pc/38216726) and using specialized recovery tools to reflash the Management Engine. You also have check BIOS settings to ensure proper ME configuration and temporarily disable fast boot to allow complete initialization. If the firmware recovery doesn't resolve the issue, this may indicate hardware-level damage to the ME controller that occurred during the previous repair, which would require professional chip-level service or potentially warranty coverage since the problem originated after authorized service work. The good news is that once the ME firmware is properly restored, your system should return to normal boot times and eliminate the restart cycles you're currently experiencing.

AMD,"u/strumpystrudel So what you're experiencing is actually pretty normal behavior for your laptop when it's unplugged - that 80% performance drop is totally expected and here's why. When your laptop is plugged into the wall, your CPU can run at much higher power levels (probably around 28W or more), but when you switch to battery, it gets severely limited to maybe 8-15W to preserve battery life. This is especially true for ultrabooks like the Gram that prioritize being thin and light over raw performance. The thing is, a lot of this power management happens at the hardware level with Intel's built-in systems, which is why all those Windows power settings you tweaked aren't really making a difference - the CPU is basically ignoring them and doing its own thing to save battery.  Now, for a game like Final Fantasy XI, you should still be able to get it running decently on battery with some tweaks, but expecting that same smooth 60 FPS at max settings is probably unrealistic given the fundamental power constraints of ultrabook design. Most ultrabooks see this kind of 60-80% performance hit on battery for any sustained workload, so you're definitely not alone in this.   But honestly, this is just how these thin and light laptops are designed to work - they're amazing when plugged in, but they have to make compromises when running on battery to actually give you decent battery life.",Neutral

AMD,I was going with the 265K over the 9800X3D since the Intel stuff seems to get better 1% lows and smoother experience at 4k and above. But does DLSS change that? Does DLSS lowering the render resolution push the 9800X3D back into the lead?,Neutral
AMD,"The issue turned out to be Bitdefender (which uses hyper-v), which I believe Killer services depend on. After uninstalling all Killer stuff, I was able to delete the Bitdefender driver and my computer is now stable.",Negative
AMD,"Tried running a clean driver reinstall using DDU. (I'm pretty sure I did this last install too but did it again to double check) and that didn't fix the issue.  ReBAR is enabled, it was on by default.  My PSU is the [Thermaltake Toughpower 650W Gold](https://www.thermaltake.com/toughpower-650w-gold-modular.html)  Windows event viewer did pick up the crash [(imgur link)](https://imgur.com/NhS5e6l), not sure what to make of it though.",Neutral
AMD,"u/Intel_Support Thank you for your guidance. My system is a prebuilt, so the processor never came in a box and is likely a tray CPU. Micro Center told me to reach out to Intel for warranty support, so I just want to confirm, should I be working with Intel directly or do you recommend contacting PowerSpec/Micro Center for the RMA? Thank you again, I look forward for the next steps!",Positive

AMD,"u/Sk7Str1p3 I'm pleased to confirm that TME is indeed supported on your i7-12700F processor. TME is a security feature that encrypts the entire system memory using AES encryption with a hardware-generated key. The i7-12700F is part of Intel's 12th generation Alder Lake family, which includes TME support as a standard security feature.  However, TME functionality requires both processor support and proper system configuration:  Verification methods:  * BIOS/UEFI security settings * System diagnostic tools that enumerate processor security features  Important considerations: TME enablement depends on the motherboard BIOS implementation and may be disabled by default on many systems.  To assist you further, I need the following information:  * Make and model of your motherboard, as the TME feature may be disabled in the BIOS settings  For your reference, please find the official documentation: 12th Generation Intel® Core™ Processors Datasheet, Volume 1 of 2  [655258](https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/655258) (Page 40) - This document contains the specific technical details about TME support for your processor.  Once you provide your motherboard information, I can guide you on how to check and potentially enable TME in your system's BIOS settings.  Please let me know if you have any additional questions.",Positive
AMD,My motherboard is Asrock H670-M Pro RS. firmware version: 18.01,Neutral
AMD,Hello. I want to tell you i7-12700f does NOT support TME. Thank you for your help anyway.,Negative
AMD,"Your Intel i7-12700F processor does support TME (Total Memory Encryption), but the issue lies with your motherboard implementation rather than CPU capability. The ASRock H670M Pro RS with firmware 18.01 appears to either disable TME at the platform level or doesn't expose the necessary BIOS controls for consumer users. This explains why your diagnostic tools show ""TME = false"" and why HWiNFO64 displays it in gray. While you could check for TME-related options in your BIOS under Advanced → CPU Configuration or Security sections, consumer-grade H670 motherboards often omit these enterprise security features from their interfaces. Your best course of action is to contact ASRock technical support directly, providing your exact motherboard model, BIOS version, and specifically asking about TME support and whether future firmware updates might include these controls.",Neutral
