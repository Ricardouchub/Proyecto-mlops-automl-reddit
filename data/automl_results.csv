Intel,Spoiler. Yes is a new variant but it is call B70 arc pro series  Not the B770 we want,Neutral
Intel,"Performance wise, how what nvidia series card will it compare to?",Neutral
Intel,"I'm sure B770 will launch as a side-effect if G31, but the real reason is for a low cost (relative) 32GB pro card to target AI. (Called B70?)  If Intel can offer 32GB VRAM on the pro card for $1000, it would be hugely popular within it's specific niche. And it's most important job is to get it into the hands of AI hobbyists to build out software support OneAPI in the open source AI community.  G31 isn't going to revolutionize the gaming market. It won't revolutionize Intel's finances. But it's goal is going to be high-VRAM at a low cost to try and build out alternatives to CUDA.   It's just a shame that it couldn't have come at a worse time from a cost-structure POV",Neutral
Intel,Curious to see if they can actually compete this time.,Neutral
Intel,What niche is this going to fill? Battlemage was already kinda iffy performance wise when the B580 launched. It really had to compete with its increased VRAM and low price. Performance is going to be aged even more now. I imagine it’ll lose to a 5060ti or at best a 5070. Obviously price is king but I don’t see this generation being performance competitive.,Negative
Intel,"As always too late - it's hard to compete when launching mid-late AMD/nvidia generation. Also curious how CPU driver head will reflect on much more powerful card, because it's still not quite resolved based of B580 tests.  Something like RX 9070 has very good pricing, especially in Europe, then RTX 5070 is very popular too. They would need to price it under 500€, likely closer to 450€ to have decent appeal, and I don't know if that's possible.",Negative
Intel,"Oh, Intel, the *timing*...",Neutral
Intel,"On TSMC 5nm with gddr6 memory, theoretically this card could have launched in 2020-2021, not 2026.",Neutral
Intel,Wondering when we'd start hearing CES stuff.,Neutral
Intel,"I might be interested in buying one of these, if it's priced right.",Positive
Intel,Celestial or maybe even Druid was supposed to be out in 2025 at one point.   https://www.techpowerup.com/292208/intel-targeting-2024-for-ultra-enthusiast-arc-celestial-gpus,Neutral
Intel,"Maxsun edition: 32gb memory, $1299 via Hydratech reseller.",Neutral
Intel,With how insane RAM shit has gone. These stock oils were bought long long ago. It won’t be in stock like… at all. Ever.,Negative
Intel,For me the sweet spot would be 5070ti performance with 32gb vram,Positive
Intel,Id sell my 4070ti super and move to this if it releases,Neutral
Intel,"Watch it end up being AI-focused, without graphics output, and part of the Flex family.",Neutral
Intel,"4070, 4070 Super at best (5070).",Positive
Intel,"b580 looks to use around 170W, this new card has a TDP of 300W so assuming the same efficiency and it uses the full 300W it'll be up to 1.76x the speed putting it between 4070 and 5070.",Neutral
Intel,"1.6x the cores, but only 1.33x the memory bus with maybe 5% faster RAM is like 1.4x the bandwidth.   So I'd guess 1.5x the B580 at best.  Which puts it below an RTX 4070.",Neutral
Intel,This must be the “4080 performance” RedGamingTech has been mentioning since 2020 /s,Neutral
Intel,"1.6 times the number of cores, 1.5 times the power draw compared to the B580. Let's say 1.4 to 1.6 times faster than the B580. That puts it at approximately the 5060ti to 4070 level.",Neutral
Intel,Nobody knows yet  I guess between 5060 ti and 5070,Neutral
Intel,vaguely 4070-5070 ish,Neutral
Intel,"we're not sure yet, its theorised to be around 5070-5070ti or 9070/xt but if intel does what they do with the b580 it'll completely destroy them on value, let's hope the ram issue doesn't kill what was shaping up to be the best gpu in recent time. the b580 is delightful.  intel 140t/v and b580 gained like a cumulative 20% perf boost this year just from drivers alone",Neutral
Intel,People are saying \~4070 at a lower cost. Intel GPUs are still space inefficient compared to Nvidia (so is AMD) so them dumping a lot of power into the chip is probably the best way for them to keep costs down.,Neutral
Intel,"Intel has so far shown to match Nvidia regarding RT performance per dollar but not ""real"" performance per watt against AMD.  As their last flagship was kinda matched into AMD 5700XT and Nvidia RTX 2070, but like 5 years too late.",Neutral
Intel,5060 Ti 16gb to 4070 Super range.,Neutral
Intel,> If Intel can offer 32GB VRAM on the pro card for $1000  If you can even find the card.  It’s bad enough that I just went with an AMD R9700 instead of waiting for the B60 or its 48GB dual variant to show up.,Negative
Intel,"Realistically? None. This is a long-term play for Intel. They know the real money's in datacenters, but the ramp up to get there now is a decade+ with how complex modern GPUs are. They're just putting a few consumer products out there to establish the product line along the way.",Neutral
Intel,It'll be priced in the 5060ti range but offer better performance. AMD doesn't offer a product at that price.,Neutral
Intel,"> because it's still not quite resolved based of B580 tests.  And it probably never will be, since a large part of it is architectural.  AMD never solved the GCN single thread bottleneck in DX11 either.",Negative
Intel,"Maybe, if it comes out soon it will be a better value than both potentially.",Positive
Intel,"Rumors were that it wasn't gonna come out. Something changed in the market to make Intel resume releasing G31.   And I'm convinced that's the fact that B70 could disrupt the market *(the market being the relatively small but growing home AI market - don't underestimate the impact this market can have on software stack support in professional environments)  As for the gaming side of things, I guess we'll find out if the driver overhead is a fixed amount or one that increases with the card's performance.",Neutral
Intel,"Where are likely a year and a half to the next Nvidia consumer cards releasing.  Assuming things like memory shortage goes away at that time, or else they might even Delay it even more.",Neutral
Intel,Nvidia released RTX 30 Series in 2020 on a variant of Samsung's 10nm.,Neutral
Intel,All about price points.,Neutral
Intel,"Aside from the architecture not existing back then, the tech is a lot cheaper now than it was then. Not using bleeding edge hardware is a good thing for a budget card.",Positive
Intel,"No way in hell it'll be anywhere near that with only 32 Xe cores, it's looking like 5060Ti at best, and only if they can get it to scale well",Negative
Intel,"You’ll end up with the same performance on the games Intel optimized the drivers for, worse performance on everything else, and no DLSS.",Negative
Intel,Why? You already have a superior GPU.,Neutral
Intel,The 4070Ti Super is literally a beast of a card. It's between the >RX 9070 and <5070Ti in rasterization and a cutdown of 4080/S,Positive
Intel,That'd be a weird thing to show off at CES.,Negative
Intel,Flex was killed.,Neutral
Intel,"That’s the relatively unobtainable Arc Pro B60 24gb and its unicorn tier 48gb dual model, save for the lack of Flex branding.",Neutral
Intel,"that would be an excellent sweet spot for sales. more than most anyone needs to play games, but not excessive.",Negative
Intel,It's not going to be linear with power. Core count and especially memory bandwidth are not scaling to that degree.,Neutral
Intel,Haven't seen them on my youtube feed in a long time.  I prefer to get all my fake rumors from MLID.,Negative
Intel,That was a rumored XE3 card. Not sure if it'll come.,Neutral
Intel,The rumor when B580 was coming out was that this should be a 4070 competitor. Don't tell people this will be anywhere close to a 5070ti lol; that'll undermine any chance of Intel having success with this card real quick.,Negative
Intel,\>5070ti or 9070/xt   Absolutely and utterly out of the question,Neutral
Intel,They can probably just make the money back for launching the larger die from cranking out 32GB professional cards.     Wouldn't be surprised if what they launch for consumers is a slightly cut down version.,Neutral
Intel,"Because ""that price"" is iGPU range.",Neutral
Intel,Intel will also end up being a year and a half out of date shipping another non-competitive entry level enterprise card.,Negative
Intel,"Fuck, it's already been half a decade.",Negative
Intel,And apple launched m1 mac on tsmc 5nm in 2020,Neutral
Intel,"My guess is that'll outperform 5060ti at higher resolutions, but trade blows and maybe even be slightly slower at lower resolution.",Neutral
Intel,If this can match the 4070ti super (>5070) in any gpu bottlenecked game that would be a huge success. Probably impossible given that this only has 32 Xe cores,Positive
Intel,Exactly why I think it's more likely than them releasing a B770.,Neutral
Intel,Been waiting for the B60 to be commonly available here and it’s more rare than the 5090 FE,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, depending on the price it could be the perfect 1440p card.",Positive
Intel,"b770 has shown up in benchmarks with 16gb gddr6 and double the CUs so that's why i gave a range, it means it is going to fall between those probably with lower spec being realistic and higher optimistic.  itd possibly be better for the consumer if it was 5070 spec and 16gb since it would be a killer affordable 1440p card with potential to do entry 4k and the community needs value right now.  if it competes with high mid range it will probably cost a ton. if they can do this card under 500 its going to be insane value. my wife and i think it'll be 500-600(msrp) but of course scalpers will do their thing",Neutral
Intel,Really all they need to do is provide a better card than the 9060xt and the 5060ti. If it's $370 it will crush the competition.,Neutral
Intel,That's because only Apple  has early access to TSMC most advanced node.,Neutral
Intel,I’d bet that equivalent generation Quadros or Radeon Pro cards are far easier to find at any price much less near MSRP or even introductory MSRP.,Neutral
Intel,"I mean honestly a 5070 is fully playable even at 4k,",Positive
Intel,I keep wondering if Apple will get everything together to actually make a gaming alternative.  They are throwing enough die space at it seemingly.,Neutral
Intel,"The total worldwide gaming market is $400 billion, about equal to Apple's yearly revenue, and only 4x Apple's yearly profit.  They will invest the minimum in the one gaming cash cow they have (iPhone) and ignore the rest, as usual.",Neutral
Intel,"They make excellent gaming devices, that's more on developers avoiding them for whatever reasons. The closed shop nature doesn't help either, they really should keep the closed stuff as a premium brand and release a new brand of more open arm hardware. They could probably make a killer handheld at a minimum.",Positive
Intel,Apple is a large player in the *total* gaming market through iOS,Neutral
Intel,I was thinking of proton on macOS that correctly uses metal.  Maybe that could happen?  Granted it adds x86 compatibility to the mix but it’s not like they did not already address that….,Neutral

Intel,"Probably one of the worst benchmarks out there for multicore tbh, I’d be more curious about the cb r24 scores",Negative
Intel,But they have a gpu compute test too,Neutral
Intel,"Geekbench claims it's much more realistic than those multicore tests that scale nearly perfectly with tons of cores, and I think that's a fair take. It's not as if they didn't know how to create a benchmark that scales like other nT tests do, geekbench 5 nT does that.   I wouldn't call it worse, just different.",Positive
Intel,It runs for far too short a time to reflect accurate multi-core performance.  People don't get a multitude of cores to run a task for a few seconds.  They do it for tasks that take minutes or hours to complete.  I'd argue it spends too little time on single-core tests as well.  I don't trust it to provide any useful information about anything other than transient performance.,Negative
Intel,I agree but the problem is it's being mindlessly used to compare MT scores as in this article.,Negative
Intel,"It's being used for comparison because that's what we have. AFAIK, this is the *only* 388H benchmark we have",Negative

And you can get a very solid product at that price tier, the RX 9060 XT is $369 on Newegg.  GPU prices haven't gone up, you money is just worth way less.",Neutral
Intel,"5050 really has no right to exist at the price it does. B580 is obviously being sold at near cost or even a loss however, it's not exactly a fair comparison but that doesn't matter to consumers.  If you just want to game then I can't see any reason to consider anything else at this price point.",Negative
Intel,I'd still probably go nvidia here as I don't trust intel's compatibility with older titles and the like.   Still it would probably be better to spend $20 more on a 9060 xt 8 gb or $50 more on a 5060 than either of these.,Neutral
Intel,"If UE5 games generally run this poor on Intel GPUs, there might be trouble ahead as there are lots of those games in the pipeline.  You still couldn't get ~~more~~ me to buy an Intel GPU, even if I was desperate for a cheap GPU right now. I'd just adjust my settings.",Negative
Intel,"The B580 is decent enough, but it might be better to just save a bit more and get a 16GB 9060 XT for $350 or something. That card is likely to last 10 years flat at this point, and it will definitely last at least 5.  And yes the 5050 is not good. Getting something with a half-decent iGPU would be a better use of your money at that point.",Negative
Intel,The biggest issue is that he did not test PCIE 3.0 vs 4.0 vs 5.0. Those GPUs are very likely to go into budget builds or as upgrades to older motherboards like the B450.,Negative
Intel,Imagine spending $250 on a GPU when you could literally just save $100 more for like a 100% percent more performance.,Neutral
Intel,Wait isn't xess a lower resolution per quality setting?,Neutral
Intel,"yeah there is a reason why there are 5050s for 210  the thing is a sub 200 dollar GPU, which matches it capability and vram well, its more or less the I want to step up from igpu deal",Neutral
Intel,Maybe for the low end but high end I can’t even buy a card at msrp outside of America.,Negative
Intel,"*ignores that this is a 50 tier product and should be compared with the 950 and 1050*  This kinda of ""but but inflation"" virtue signalling I'd very unhelpful to these kinds of discussions.

Intel,Tech is supposed to beat inflation. Look at monitors or TVs or SSDs (before now) or CPUs or ....,Neutral
Intel,All the tech tubers are just turning into old men shouting at clouds. They will probably all be replaced by younger people living in the now soon enough.,Negative
Intel,"First of all 250 euros bought way more gpu in 2015 than 360 does today. And the lower end and midrange gpus were much less cut down vs the high end chipa today.  A 5050 sits where the 750ti did when the 980ti was out. Now you get entry level performance for mid end prices  Have wages actually increased that much? Because that is the only useful measure of ""inflation"". Everything else is just corporate profits   If prices for everything go up but wages don't then that leaves less money for frivolous shit like ram and storage and laptops and consoles, not more.  Even in my country where our wages are automatically indexed to match inflation, our purchasing power has dropped because the actual cost of living isn't properly represented in whichever calculation is used for the inflation number.  Houses have gone up by 100+ percent since 2015, rents have gone up by over 60 percent, grocery prices have more than doubled, utility prices have risen sharply, public transport has more than tripled in cost.  Minor expenses like clothing or a tv you buy every ten years have stayed flat, but that isnt what people are spending 80 percent of their income on.",Neutral

Intel,"> Yep, inflation. $250 in 2015 money is $342 in todays money.   People really need to stop using CPI. I can bet you that GPUs don't make it to the market basket. Yes, your money's value has fallen but not by that much.",Negative
Intel,You're getting downvoted for speaking the truth.  The RTX 5050 should be a $150-180 GPU for the price and value it offers but unfortunately people are gonna defend the price tag that the card was set for by Nvidia,Negative

Intel,"I'd say that the cheapest new GPU that I'd blanket recommend with no ifs, buts and caveats is the 9060XT 16GB, everything below that either struggles with outright performance, VRAM or software issues like Arc.",Neutral
Intel,"Intel checks all the right boxes on paper (generous VRAM, decent pricing compared to competitors, an alternative to the duopoly) but the recent CPU overhead stuff coupled with the crapshoot that is trying to play older games and it just isn't worth it",Negative
Intel,"Yeah they cover this at the start of the video https://youtu.be/lLe5AP6igjw?t=229   XeSS 1.3 shifts everything down a tier, so their quality scaling ratio is everyone elses balanced ratio.  Older versions of XeSS match DLSS/FSR scaling ratios.",Neutral
Intel,"I know quality is, not 100% sure about others. dlss quality preset uses higher resolution than XeSS and FSR quality presets",Neutral
Intel,Its fine for people who need a dGPU but not a beast for work. think stuff like CAD or Photoshop. It will also be fine for people who only play competitive multiplayer games.,Neutral
Intel,Nvidia cards are bellow MSRP here in eastern europe. AMD cards slightly above MSRP.,Neutral
Intel,"They are all selling below MSRP in the UK. £979 is MSRP for a 5080 and I can buy 3 in stock models for less than that price without much searching, at scan.co.uk.

Intel,"You are just making shit up at this point. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 (2013) release price: $250.   That was a shit card, arguably a worse product than the 9060 XT is today, when you compare it to contemporary rivals. How do i know it was shit? I had it.",Negative
Intel,TSMC inflation is FAR higher than CPI. You are half right,Neutral
Intel,"according to US bureau of labour staticstics that measures the CPI it includes  all personal computers (desktops, laptops, tablets) and related equipment (printers, monitors, smartwatches, smartphones). It does not look at GPUs specifically, but the effect of that will be visible.",Neutral

Intel,"i mean, the 5050 off of amazon rn is 210, so it is getting there as a sub 200 dollar GPU for improving over iGPU right",Neutral
Intel,I pretty much but there's nothing else people *trust* in the category because apparently Arc cards are for professional nerds or something whereas I haven't had a real bad driver issue in over 2 years with my A770  People are also conditioned to fear older gen GPUs so 6xxx and 7xxx parts are sitting on shelves waiting for blowout discounts. People would still rather spend more on a basic nvidia from the 5000 series.,Negative
Intel,B580 user here. I coupled it with a R5 5500 and as of the recent updates the card just seemed to run much better vs when I got it last July.  There was a video before which also revealed that the CPU overhead is now being addressed in subsequent updates.  https://youtu.be/gfqGqj2bFj8?si=PyAfB2NhqZKWWVXY  I’d say it’s getting better and that I’d recommend it over a 5050 since the overhead is now fixed/negligible.,Positive
Intel,Intel is in their second GPU generation. Its going to take a lot longer to catch up with the institutional knowledge and practical application in videogames that the others were developing for over 20 years. The CPU overheard was not an issue in Intel iGPUs and Alchemist because GPUs never got fast enough to matter. It is only now that they noticed that issue since the GPU is far enough to create it.,Neutral
Intel,And that only in terms of native resolution and does not mean equal final image quality.,Neutral
Intel,\>dlss quality preset uses higher resolution than XeSS and FSR quality presets  Not exactly. FSR and DLSS are evenly matched in internals at all quality presets.,Neutral

Intel,"It sure is funny every time all those 6700k/8700k era CPU's pop up on used parts sites or FB Marketplace and still expecting close to initial prices.  Who even buys them anymore? At least a Q6600 has retro value ,but those are just obsolete.",Negative
Intel,"Not if you consider how the workloads being run on them have also changed. A GTX 970 ($450 inflation adjusted) would have run 2015 games better than how a RTX 5060 Ti ($429) or 5070 ($550) run 2025 games.  In other words, demand for performance has outstripped performance improvements, and those improvements are not felt as much.",Neutral
Intel,"A 100$ CPU in 2015 would easily run 2015 made software. A 100$ CPU in 2025 would barely run the electron JS slop. This includes Windows.

It needs few second to run settings, it lags when opening notepad, it is disgustingly slow while navigating file explorer on my 1000 dollar ""gaming laptop"" with NVMe SSD.  Yes yes yes it is very good on benchmarks but I don't stare at benchmarks all day. I use my computer for things you do at computer. Don't force my CPU to crunch how much digits of Pi it can compute.  A 980 Ti can easily run top 2015 games. Now? My laptop barely runs modern AAA games without looking a blurry mess.

Intel,"Why aren't you comparing relative buying power of 2014/2015 vs now then?  $650 got you what in 2014, a GTX 980TI?  $330 got you what in 2014? How close to the top end are both these things?    That's $900/$455 today, thereabouts.  What does $900 get you today?  Does that buy you anywhere near the top end?  And how does that product compare in relation to others above and below it?  Because the $330 product in question ($455 today) got you about ~75% to top end performance for ~half~ MSRP of the 980TI.  How does a $455 product of today square up relative to the top end?   Why don't we throw in a GTX 980TI vs a GTX 280 comparison while we're at it.  Make things really interesting.  I'll let you fill in those blanks (along with the $330 card in question) hoping you actually learn something in the process here.  The bar is very low, try not to trip.

Intel,How is it comparable? The 9060 XT is a very good card for 250. Ideally it'd be around 200 or below but for 250 you get a card that's a bit overkill for even 1080 P gaming.,Positive
Intel,In quite a few countries the 9060 XT is at or below the RTX 5050s MSRP.,Neutral
Intel,Then why did the comment above mine get multiple downvotes? It's Reddit and that's how it goes unfortunately,Negative
Intel,6x and 7x are priced far too high for old stock and are poor value compared to nvidias 50 series. They really haven't had a good price/performance low-mid end card since the 6700XT which are extinct at retail.,Negative
Intel,"I think they must have to go into every game, and adjust that t fix it, because it's not a universal fix it seems. Maybe per-game optimizations .",Negative
Intel,yep. XeSS 1.3 is closer to DLSS 3 rather than DLSS 4 in terms of image quality. Its good enough to game on in my opinion.,Positive
Intel,"> Who even buys them anymore?  The best SKUs on sockets have always demanded a premium in the used market. Since that's where people upgrading old machines will go.  And many machines from OEMs are not readily upgradable with just new boards/CPUs combos. Since they use custom form factors etc. So it's either a in socket upgrade or replace the whole machine. The socket 6700k is on is also especially affected by the ""premium"" factor. Since there's no lower end SKU with 4C/8T. You either get the 6700/7700 variants or are stuck with lower thread count.",Negative
Intel,"> would have run 2015 games better than how a RTX 5060 Ti ($429) or 5070 ($550) run 2025 games.  I think your memory is impacted by the expectations at the time.

To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.  Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.

Intel,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.  EDIT: 8060S (Strix Halo) is \~18,000 for reference.  EDIT 2: 890M (strix point's top end) about 8,100, so the PTL 12Xe chip will smoke that.

Well, we already had rumors of Intel struggling to hit actual intended frequency-goals, no?  Though especially the actual performance-metrics of the node will be quite sobering I think.  The power-draw of these SKUs is supposed to be a TDP of *officially* 25W – In reality, these parts are allowed to draw as much as 55W (2+0+4 or 4+0+4) and 65/80W (4+4+4 and 4+8+4) respectively.  So it must be seen, if these parts are any more efficient in daily usage, or just a side-grade to Lunar Lake.",Neutral
Intel,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power. A 10-15% frequency advantage would go a long, long way towards closing gaps if it comes as a relatively small power cost.",Neutral

Intel,">I can't say I'm entirely sold on the idea of having three core clusters humming inside my laptop.  From a user's perspective, CPU's are a blackbox and the inner-working details are irrelevant. What matters is results. They want, typically, a balance of performance, battery life, heat / fan noise, and cost, placing greater emphasis on one of these categories over the others.  The idea is that P cores = performance optizied  E cores = Area optimized  LP-E Cores = power optimized.  The theory being to have different core types focus on different parts of PPA.  E cores and LP-E cores are the same microarchitecture. Just LP-E cores are off-ring so the ring (and rest of the cores) can be powered down in light-load scenarios.  Intel's biggest problem is that looking at each of the cores, the P cores perform their designated role the worst. 200% larger than E cores for \~10% more IPC and \~15% more clockspeed is a pretty rough trade off - and by the time you've loaded all P cores and need to load E cores too, that clockspeed difference diminishes hard.

Intel,"Jaykihn attributes only density to the supposed heat issues, not BSPD.

With fewer thermal constraints and much higher power budgets, they should be able to push well past the perf/W peak, where it should continue to scale well and for a long time before it starts hitting severely diminishing returns.  I'm not talking 300W monster CPUs, but the scaling between a 65W and 105W 18A CPU should be more significant than on current nodes, where you might gain like 10-15% additional performance from that 50% power bump.

If they have a 'double upgrade' opportunity in both fixing the discovered 18A issues and implementing the originally planned 18AP improvements then it could end up being a somewhat bigger jump.  Don't think it'll be an N2 beater though.  18AP *might* beat the best of N3 in some applications, we'll see.  For that you'd want to look ahead to 14A where the CFO mentioned on the earnings call (and he was somewhat realistic in other areas so it's more believable here) that 14A has been a positive surprise and they're actually pretty excited about it.  It's possible that if Intel gets more experience on High-NA versus TSMC that they might start having an edge later on.  Maybe.",Neutral

Intel,"Yeah after being reminded that the LPE cores are also Darkmont like the E-Cores I looked up the layout in detail and the differences is simply the P and E cores are on a large Cluster with L3 Cache and a fast ring-bus, but the LPE cores are seperated from that Ring-bus and don't have any L3 Cache (just access to a ""memory side-cache"" accessible by the NPU and small cluster but not the large cluster).     They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them.

Though, it's kind of ironic, how Intel all by itself proved themselves liars, when it took them basically +6 years since 2017, for eventually coming up with only a mere chiplet-copycat and their first true disintegrated chiplet-esque design …  For a design, which *in their world-view*, Intel was working on their tiles-approach already since a decade, which is at least what they basically claimed when revealed by 2018 – I called that bullsh!t the moment I first heard it. Surprise, surprise, they again straight-up *lied* about it …  They most definitely did NOT have had worked on anything chiplets/tiles before, if it took them *this* long.  Just goes to show how arrogant Intel was back then, letting AMD cooking their Zen in complete silence since 2012/2013, for their later Ryzen. *Still boggles my mind, how Intel could let that happen* …  > Yes, they also benefitted a lot from both having an actually decent node and on-package memory […]  In any case, we can't really deny the fact, that Intel basically cheated on Lunar Lake using OpM, eventually creating a halo-product, which ironically was quite sought after, but yet expensive asf to manufacture.  If AMD would've been to cheat like that (using OpM) in a mobile SKU, while dealing some marked cards in such a underhanded manner, it would've been ROFL-stomped Lunar Lake …",Neutral

Every research report shows that demand for high-end GPUs is still strong. Steam HW survey shows the most popular GPUs are still mid-range gaming cards, showing that discrete GPUs remain central to the PC ecosystem.  And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",Neutral

Small models, like a 1B parameters voice model, will naturally fit. The larger the model you want to train, the more complex the architecture might be, but there are ways to train even models over 100B parameters on such hardware, like routing distributed fine grained experts. Not that I think it's a good idea at this point.",Neutral

The actual answer is, that this on the slide was surely NOT done slide by accident, but it figuratively puts PTL's X^e Graphics tiles of PTL's iGPU *on par* with their dedicated Battlemage-cards, which (at least in Intel's eyes) shall from now on signal a ""continuation"" of  Battlemage itself.

Intel,Because it's most likely still the same foundation. Xe3 just have additional optimizations and HW blocks along the lines of OMM (confirmed) and whatever new tech Intel decides is worth pushing for higher end parts.

Intel,"> It explicitly calls BMG dGPU cards ""discrete"" and does not do so for PTL  Of course not, since it would instantly tank their reputation and will kill all further ARC-sales?!  Do you actually think, that Intel is that stupid to plain announce the death of ARC-series graphics-cards? Do you think they'd even sell a hundreds cards after such a announcement? Who would by a dead-end line of graphics-cards, which won't even get any further driver-support and still have disastrous drivers like Intel's ARC? NO-ONE!  Of course they virtue signal it through the backdoor here, to preserve the sell-off the of the rest of pile of shame of their B-series graphics-cards as long as possible (leaving users with none support afterwards), and *only then* pull the plug afterwards when they went through their inventory …  Since when are you following Intel? Intel has always done so, and only announced a sudden discontinuation once the inventory was sold (leaving customers in the open with no further support overnight), despite virtue signalling a continuation all the time (to preserve a proper sell-off).  ---- Wasn't this exactly the same story with **Optane** back then? Each and every question upon a future support was answered in the affirmative, only to pull the plug overnight again as usual …  I'm not another piracy of cons here, it's Intel pulling the same Optane-stunt with ARC – Happily selling off their cards, knowing darn well, that they will pull the plug, yet refuse to actually play with open cards again.",Negative

Intel,"You have to look at this from both sides.  This would give NVidia the ability to offer OEMs a tightly integrated on SOC gfx solution vs a separate discrete gfx package as it is now. This would lower costs for NVidia's customers as well as improve performance and Intel's cpu's get to ride that train.   Intel has a long track record of using integrated gfx so it's certainly right up their alley to take this on.  Could Xe gfx coexist with NVidia? Yep, I think so.  Xe could be the budget igfx option and iNVidia is the premium integrated solution. That's basically how it is now with Intel Arc/Battlemage & GTX.   On the DC side, Intel has absolutely no gfx solution at this time and won't have anything for at least two years.  Intel already sells NVidia when a gfx solutions are needed so tighter integrated products will benefit both sides in that DC space as well.",Positive
Intel,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work.

Nvidia's and AMD's cards outperform it in gaming raster performance thanks to having been in the market for much longer. They have the more efficient architecture and software for gaming. It wouldn't be great for marketing if Arc came out at the same time with similar pricing, yet got beaten in the FPS benchmarks.  But productivity cards could wait. Arc's always been very competitive in productivity tasks. Maybe because Intel has more experience in this department. So reliable driver is the focus here.",Positive

Intel,"It's a really good general purpose card. Perhaps not the best card if you want to squeeze out the most fps out of games, but it performs really well in a wide range of tasks including gaming. And yes 12GB VRAM really comes in handy.  It can easily be found for under $250. B580 is still cheaper than 5060 and 9060 XT and even RTX 5050 and RX 7600, especially in the UK where you can find a B570 for only 20 pounds more than RTX 3050. That's way cheaper than RX 6600, it's a no brainer. But the prices could only go down thanks to economy of scale mostly. It's been produced for a while, that's why.  Also one of the big reasons it's still selling now is thanks to good publicity. Imagine if it came out as the same time as RX 9060 XT. HWU would tear a new hole regardless of how much of an improvement it is over the Alchemist cards and the impressive productivity performance.

AutoDesk for example will tell you to go pound sand if you try to get support and you aren't running a workstation GPU with ECC VRAM. So for businesses running AutoDesk software in a professional capacity, or businesses needing SR-IOV, you could offer them a 3090 or a 5070 Ti Super to them for $100 and it still won't be an option for them, because for their needs they might as well be paperweights.",Neutral

Intel,"iirc, SR-IOV and VDI support in the coming months, toggleable ECC support, and it is ISV certified",Neutral
Intel,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction. Very important when running 24-48 hour simulations.",Neutral
Intel,Software support is a thing. CAD applications like solidworks and inventor don’t officially support the GeForce rtx or radeon rx line of gpus and they’re considered untested unsupported options.

Intel,I’ve been working in a professional aechtiectural environment for 5 years and haven’t seen the need for ECC once.   Can you explain situations where it’s needed? I’ve always wondered.,Neutral
Intel,"SR-IOV for (license-free!) vGPU is IMHO the killer feature here, perhaps along with being able to get 16GB of VRAM per card relatively cheaply and without needing auxiliary power.  Both open up interesting server and workstation use cases that can't be had cheaply from the competition.",Positive
Intel,Have you tried GPU paravirtualization?,Neutral
Intel,"You can buy it off AIB Partners but you can't buy it at retail (i.e. microcenter, newegg] and it doesn't have an official MSRP yet.   The prices you see now are what AIB's want to charge in bulk orders.    If you want to know how much let's say 5 B60's cost you have to get a quote from a distributor",Neutral
Intel,They need GPU IP for two things: client and AI. Anything else is expendable.,Neutral
Intel,"Yes, my point was *if* they have the gaming cards, they can justify the professional line, but it's not nearly big enough to justify making a dGPU to begin with.",Neutral
Intel,"SR-IOV is Virtual GPU (SR-IOV is IO Virtualization used to split PCIe lanes into virtual functions so their physical function can be shared between VMs). No consumer cards support Virtual GPU right now besides Pascal/Turing with driver hacks. AMD's SR-IOV offerings are [very limited](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#virtualization-support), [And Nvidia has a bigger selection](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/gpus-supported-by-vgpu.html) but their budget VGPU options are being phased out (P40).  I believe VDI is Microsoft's implementation. I believe I've done VDI on my RTX 2070 before (I have done seamless sharing between host and VM), but I don't know if it's possible with AMD. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm more familiar with the Linux side / vGPU than VDI.  ECC is Error Correcting RAM. I generally don't understand the use case for ECC either, but it is ubiquitous in HPC. All server boards support ECC RAM.  In modern environments most of these features need 16GB of VRAM minimum, but if you ever wanted to try it on a consumer card, you could get an old RTX 20 series and try it out with some driver mods. Optionally, the P40 is still pretty cheap ($250 used) and doesn't need those hacks at the cost of drawing a lot of power, which Intel has solved with their Battlemage Pro platform (by far the cheapest VRAM/$/W you can get).",Neutral

Intel,RTX 3090 Ti and RTX 4090 have ecc. Not that they're cheap.,Neutral
Intel,"It's needed whenever the work you're doing matters and a single-bit error could cause significant harm.  Something like audio or video, a single-bit error probably isn't very noticeable.  Calculations, it absolutely depends on what you're calculating and which bit gets flipped; flipping the low-order bit in a number might not matter much and flipping the high-order bit could cause a big error.  Networking, it depends on whether the protocols you use have more error checks at a higher level (TCP does; UDP does not).  If in doubt, you want ECC, but market segmentation to mostly restrict ECC support to ""server"" chips and boards and charge more for ECC memory means you'll overpay for it.",Negative
Intel,"They're so good, I wish there was a single slot variant.   I want to put them in my MS-01s. The Sparkle A310, being the main candidate for deployment in those machines, only has 4GB and its maximum h264 encoding throughput actually drops below the iGPU (although its h265 and AV1 throughput slaps the 12900H/13900H).

Intel,"Where can you get them? And are they for sale yet, or pre-orders, or...?",Neutral
Intel,"The problem with Gaudi (I know, I've written code and run training runs on it) is simply that the programming model is not oneAPI, or whatever oneAPI becomes. Yes, pytorch works, but people care a lot about software longevity and long term vision when buying $5mm+ of GPUs (and these are the purchases Intel cares about that can actually start to offset the cost of development).   The whole purpose behind Falcon Shores (and now Jaguar Shores, if it will even happen) is to put Gaudi performance (i.e. tensor cores) in an Xe-HPC package. Unifying graphics and compute packages is what NVIDIA was able to achieve but not yet AMD, and it's really great for encouraging ML development in oneAPI.  See this post to see where Intel would like to be: https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-2-8-brings-native-xccl-support-to-intel-gpus-case-studies-from-argonne-national-laboratory/ (they don't mention the ""XPU"" because it's Ponte Vecchio, which are iiuc worse than A100s).",Neutral

Intel,"Yup. For example you are doing a structural integrity physics simulation, and a single flipped bit can ruin your 1 week long run (and your liability insurer will reject your claim, a lot of them have standards requiring calculations to be done only on ECC for sensible reasons).",Neutral

Intel,"Mediated pass though requires big ass license fees vGPU/MxGPU, and isn't FOSS other than Intel's currently broken support that they abandoned for SR-IOV support.  API forwarding only support limited host/guest setups, and even more limited API support. The only FOSS support is VirGL, which only support Linux host/guest and only OpenGL.  Obviously fixed pass though is an option, but even that isn't without issue. NVIDIA only recently removed the driver restriction, they could add it back at any time. Plus you are limited on virtual machine by the physical GPU count. It works with Intel GPUs and is FOSS with them.  SR-IOV on Intel fixes all of that. It works amazingly well with their iGPUs, has no license issues, and is fully FOSS.",Negative
Intel,Hey no need to be aggressive towards the other user. Your comments are very helpful and I appreciated them a lot but keep it constructive please!,Positive
Intel,"LMAO, I actually have quite a bit of knowledge in this area.  If all you care for is VDI for a small number of VMs, then you'd go GPU passthrough. vGPU / MxGPU often requires higher levels of hypervisor software tier (i.e. VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus), requiring more money. For KVM hosts, setting up vGPU is a lot more difficult and time consuming than just straight up GPU passthrough.  Only two groups of people would be interested in GPU virtualization / splitting:  * Enterprise, in which they wouldn't care about the used card prices.  * Enthusiasts, in which they wouldn't want to pay for vGPU prices anyway. So why bother catering to this crowd?",Neutral
Intel,"Full GPU passthrough is not a solution that many people would consider because it is clumsier than using sr-iov (or potentially VirtIO GPU Venus). Plus for each extra passthrough instance I would have to add in another GPU and this greatly increases power consumption, heat output and cooling requirements. The process is not all that much more complicated at least on Turing GPUs with a hacked driver on KVM guests at least. Plus for passthrough, you probably still need an NVIDIA card because last I checked AMD cards still had a random kernel panic issue after being passed through.  My assumption is that sr-iov on the b50 will allow users an affordable way to have multiple guests on one host GPU without increasing power draw and paying for expensive alternatives and expensive vGPU subscriptions.",Negative
Intel,"...first time I heard people prefer SRIOV over GPU passthrough because it's ""clumsier"" lol. I'm sure setting up mdev devices in KVM, finding the correct corresponding GPU instances, making them persistent through reboot, then edit virsh xml for each individual VM is a lot easier than just doing IOMMU passthrough. /s     Again, enthusiasts don't care about power consumption / heat output / cooling requirements for their lab environment. Enterprise that do care about them are very willing to pay extra cost to get a production ready driver. You're creating a hypothetical situation that simply does not exist in the real world.",Neutral
Intel,"It's good they launching this, this card adds some competition to the landscape, but before anyone buys it they should figure out if their drivers are lighter weight.  It's hard to think of this fitting a niche of someone with a pretty powerful CPU who wants a midrange GPU.  The more ARC cards out there the more developers get familiar with them, the more XeSS v2 gets added to titles, the more the drivers get matured and the better future ARC cards will be.  I'd happily pick up an ARC card... once they've proved themselves in terms of driver maturity and overhead.",Positive

Returning to the store is a lot easier than doing a warranty claim with the part maker.  * You can’t test that everything works together until you can fully assemble the PC. See previous point about return policies.",Neutral
Intel,"All looks good. Except be quiets arent really good case fans. Get thermalright cl14s or something else, anything really. If u wanna get a better psu and save somewhere else, just get one cl14 and maybe a cheaper thermalright cooler. I bought a used thermalright gf1 750w for 55 eur, so u can look into that as well.",Positive
Intel,What is the total allotted budget? And location?,Neutral
Intel,The thermalright royal pretor is as expensive on aliexpress (here in Belgium last i checked) but waaay better at cooling.  I'm using it myself on a 7800x3d and my idle is 30°c and gaming it goes 55°c. I haven't done a stress test yet though. (might boot one up rn)  I would also recommend you not to skimp on the psu but everyone has their reasons and preferences.,Positive
Intel,"Above build is okay.  If your budget allows you to change the motherboard to a B650, then do it",Neutral
Intel,i'd recommend using intel 225f with b860 mobo. no need to buy an extra cpu cooler as the 225f comes with one. overall that'd be cheaper than what you planned and intel platforms are more stable and reliable,Positive
Intel,"First build I’ve ever seen on this subreddit with an intel gpu  Looks pretty good to me, I would change out the PSU, you should be going for gold rated or higher",Positive
Intel,"Dawg, I was already gonna use the 550w version of that PSU, but switched over bc the 650w one was gonna let me upgrade the GPU down the line. My total wattage is like 380 lmao",Neutral

Intel,"Well, the PSU is ok, right? Like, it works according to reviews",Positive
Intel,"I think I was clear when I said ""IF"" you want to upgrade.  Upgrade isn't only from B580 to something like 5060 Ti. It could be a 5070Ti or 5080 too.",Neutral
Intel,It's quite a bit more but also a board with excellent power delivery and the feature set and io is improved. It's the b650 eagle ax for 50 more euros.,Positive
Intel,I cant. Due to no option for Lithuania in pcpricetracker.,Neutral
Intel,"Thinking about it. It really depends on you.  Are you upgrading next year, go for the 850w one. Also if it is not a big upgrade. You want some headroom and also keep that battery at it's sweet 50% mark.  If you are upgrading waay later like 2-3 years. Just get this one and save up for a good psu  Edit: your psu has most important safety features but is nothing to write home about. With a warranty of 5 years. So you should be fine.  It has everything you need but constraints you in wattage and only one 4x4 connector. (if you plan on upgrading your motherboard for a better cpu)",Neutral

Intel,"If GPU isn't close to 100% you are CPU limited. The only sizable upgrade would be a ryzen x3d CPU (the i9s aren't much faster than the 13700k), which means new motherboard and ram.   I would honestly stick with what you have. If you want to improve performance a bit you could try overclocking the CPU and ram.",Neutral
Intel,"How does 80% usage point to your GPU needing to be upgraded? The only worthwhile jump for you would be either an X3D chip CPU which is not cheap as you'd have to swap mobo and ram, or going to like a 5070 TI which is only I think like a 30% performance jump for like $750 at best?",Neutral
Intel,"Looks pretty good as is, you are cpu limited though. Running at 1080p? Only thing I would suggest (which is free) is ensuring XMP is enabled and your ram is running st full speed. Other than that, you could try disabling e-cores and/or overclock the P-cores.  Also would you really benefit from more than 160-200fps?",Positive
Intel,"Leave it as is  Tweak your RAM for a bit more negligible performance gains  If you want more out of your current GPU, you'd want to get on the AM5 platform   If you want to ""bottleneck"" more so with a faster GPU, you'll have to upgrade your power supply as well",Neutral
Intel,"I have a 9800X3D and get the same numbers in BF6. I run it at 1080p low.   There's really no point in upgrading. BF6, Arc raiders, Warzone are all CPU-bound games. But they all run very well.   In order for you to get higher than the 160-200fps that you're currently getting in those games, you'll need to either use DLSS and/or Frame Gen (it looks really ugly and fuzzy using DLSS at 1080p); or spend over $1200 upgrading CPU and GPU for what would amount to barely a 40fps increase - if any. DDR5 prices are through the roof and with me being on DDR5, I'm telling you that moving to DDR5 alone is NOT going to give you a performance improvement because your limitation is not memory bandwidth as I already stated I get similar numbers.   Just keep what you have. You got a great rig. No reason to needlessly upgrade your rig when the improvement isn't going to give you what you're looking for. And thats even after selling your old parts.  Overclocking might give you a very tiny bump in performance - but in order to have a stable and reliable overclock, on GPU, CPU & RAM... its incredibly tedious work that takes weeks of testing every single change - for what amounts to usually less than a 10% gain. CPU & GPU already overclock themselves due to algorithmic boost clocks that are based on temperature headroom and the load of the instruction set as it is.",Negative
Intel,Get a cheap AMD second GPU and run lossless scaling 👍 you might need a bigger PSU but overall this is a cheap upgrade path for 2x dos since you'd have to upgrade to a beefier GPU or new mobo+CPU to get gains here.,Neutral
Intel,"Your CPU is fine – a 13700KF isn’t holding you back in Warzone/BF. The weak link right now is the RAM. You’ve got 32GB of DDR4-3200, which is pretty slow for that chip. Swapping to a 32GB kit of DDR4-3600 CL16 is cheap and will help 1% lows and overall smoothness.  On the GPU side: even though you “only” see ~80% usage, it can still be the limiter. GPU usage is an average – it can spike to 99% in microbursts, and as long as GPU frame time is higher than CPU frame time, the GPU is what’s capping FPS. In practice, if the GPU is consistently loaded more than the CPU in a game, you’re effectively GPU-bound.  If you want more FPS right now, a 4070 Ti Super or 4080 Super is the logical upgrade. If you’re not in a rush, you could skip a mid-cycle upgrade and wait for a 50-series card (5070/5080/5090) once prices settle – that’ll be a bigger jump per dollar than going from a 4070 to another 40-series card today.  Also, the HYTE Y40 looks great but can be a bit tight on GPU airflow. Adding a couple of bottom intake fans blowing at the GPU is a cheap tweak that helps temps and lets the card hold higher boost clocks.  TL;DR: – Keep the 13700KF – Upgrade RAM to 32GB DDR4-3600 CL16 – You’re still effectively GPU-limited even at ~80% usage – Options: 4070 Ti Super / 4080 Super now or wait and jump to a 50-series (5070/5080/5090) – Add bottom intake fans for better GPU airflow",Neutral
Intel,He's not CPU limited at 40% usage.,Neutral
Intel,"Game's don't use many cores, so CPU usage stays low even when you are cpu limited",Neutral
Intel,"40% utilization on OP's 13700KF can mean there are 4-6 cores that are at 100% utilization.   Most games barely use 6 cores so a CPU that has 16 cores like OPs CPU, a CPU doesn't have to hit 100% utilization in order to be CPU-limited.   Many games behave this way because they are primarily CPU-bound and there really isn't anything you can do about it.   OP upgrading to a 13900k or 14900 MIGHT help, but the performance improvement is going to be so low that it will never actually justify the cost of upgrading.",Neutral
Intel,r/buildapcforme,Neutral
Intel,Excellent bang for buck with drivers getting better and better.,Positive
Intel,They're good if it's a decent bit cheaper than the 9060 xt.  You also need a fast CPU since the b580 scales with how good/bad your CPU is.,Positive
Intel,"Are you buying brand new or used? If you are considering new, I would suggest going used instead as you can get a better card for the same amount of money as a new B580.",Neutral
Intel,I mean it's alright. It's got 12GB of VRAM which is cool I guess but XeSS is not that great compared to DLSS 4 and FSR 4 these days and the performance is slower than a 5060 or 9060 XT 8GB.,Negative
Intel,"I have a B580 linked up to a 4K TV. The only quirk I've really noticed is that changes in resolution, refresh rate or HDR on/off will occasionally cause the TV to hard reboot. I'm not sure if this would happen with a regular PC monitor, but this never happened with the previous GTX 750 Ti I had.  Otherwise performance in games is as expected from reviews. I don't play AAA games in 4K with it, but haven't had crashing issues that some people report.",Neutral
Intel,"with how bad GPU pricing is slated to be due to the memory shortages, I'm starting to consider a B580 so I can at least have a GPU that should be able to play BeamNG in 3440x1440. not keen on having to replace it within less than three years though, but maybe I'm severely overestimating how much GPU I actually need in a realistic gaming scenario. the used market here has been rather dodgy as of late.",Negative

Intel,"Agree, the only high ticket items i buy used are things i can physically fix myself such as cars and bikes",Neutral
Intel,"You are incredibly misinformed. TV upscalers are nothing like DLSS and FSR.  A TV's upscaler really doesn't work all that well in gaming one because they generally don't really make games running at 1080p look like 4K since that's what most TVs are nowadays and this is coming from someone with a 4K Samsung.  Also DLSS and FSR improve performance, reduce motion blur, give better anti aliasing than regular TAA all of which a TV upscaler doesn't do.   Also TV upscalers introduce extra processing lag from the upscaling which DLSS and FSR straight up lower latency because of the performance uplift.",Negative
Intel,"It's technically slower than even the 9060 XT 8GB which is usually around the same price give or take 20-30 bucks. I wouldn't call it ""seriously impressive for the price"" at all it's only saving grace is having 12GB of VRAM but it's got iffy drivers, cpu overhead and a worse upscaler.  It's not impressive at all. It's decent at best. It's cool that it has 12GB of VRAM and that might matter in a handful of games at 1080p at maxed out settings or matter more in 1440p but it really lacks reasonable performance to play the latest games in 1440p without relying on upscaling which it has been surpassed by in FSR4",Negative
Intel,"oh thank you so much for the info. i'd look into that. i'm using a samsung 65"" 4k tv and i usually output 1440p from the gpu via hdmi to the tv and let the tv do the upscaling thing. i'd try enabling the upscaling in gpu and output 4k to the tv and see if i could spot the difference",Positive

Intel,9070xt now might be able to find a 4070ti super used or open box somewhere for cheaper if you want nvidia,Neutral
Intel,"5070 Ti is the better choice. Especially at 1440p, you really don’t need anything more. 5080 is only 15% faster and is 30% more expensive.",Positive
Intel,Get the RTX 5080 Ventus.,Neutral
Intel,"I think the 5070ti is a good choice.  Keep in mind, you'd need to upgrade the PSU if you go higher which would add a little more costs to them.",Positive

Intel,"Hell yeah a 5080 will be a really good upgrade !   It is worth it, if you have the money for it.  You will you will.. worst case scenario you crank the graphics. Obviously you will feel the slower CPU and RAM down the line but not tomorrow !   And don't forget to set nvidia boost thing to just ON not on+ boost since you will have a weaker CPU than GPU",Positive
Intel,If you can grab the 5080 for retail do that.,Neutral
Intel,"I would keep it, isn't 2070 good enough?",Neutral
Intel,I ended up getting the 5070ti for the reasons you mention. After doing research it seemed like 5070ti was great for 1440 and so far I’ve been loving it. I’m getting around 140fps on Arc Raiders.,Positive
Intel,Yep the 5080 is a bad value compared to the 5070 Ti and is nowhere near the 5090 despite the name.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly, not sure what everyone is smoking to justify the 5080 when OP wants a monitor too.",Negative
Intel,Is 750w really not enough for 5700x3d and 5080? I was planning on updating the PSU when I update my CPU and RAM when the situation maybe gets a little better.,Neutral
Intel,It’s bad advice to say the 5080 is worth a 28% increase in price for far less than that in performance,Negative
Intel,"There actually is also the possibility of going 9070 XT when talking value. Cheapest, which is Powercolor's Reaper going for 639€ right now compared to the 5070 TI's 769€ pricetag.",Neutral
Intel,I'm just going off what nVidia recommends and what google outputs.  The 5700x3D is a 105W CPU and the recommendations probably include 170Ws.  I suspect the 750W would work on a lot of games and crash at random times.  It also might just kill the PSU sooner.  I mainly like the 5070s cause as far as I know they don't suffer from any connectors melting.,Negative
Intel,Not what I said haha bro can do with he wants he will see a difference in perf. Not talking about price. If he has the money go for it.   My 5090 is bad advice but shit does it ever rip !,Negative
Intel,I just upgraded to a 9070 XT from a 2070 Super. Couldn’t be happier. It has amazing performance for the price. I use a 4k tv as a monitor and it is tackling 4k games well and 1440p games perfectly.   I was on the fence between the 9070 XT and the 5070 TI but the cost savings for essentially equal performance helped me decide.,Positive
Intel,Well yeah that’s another 130€ you could save especially if you’re playing BF6 and CS2,Positive
Intel,130€ puts them at equal value once you take nvidias feature set into account in my eyes. Id go 5070ti + 280hz tandem oled,Neutral
Intel,Mainly what I'm interested is will the difference in performance be noticeable between 5070TI and 5080 since I'm probably pretty CPU bound with 5700x3d. I might probably sell my GPU and go all out in 2 years.,Neutral
Intel,Holy fuck buddy bro said he wants a monitor at some point maybe blowing another ~$370 CAD on a graphics card isn’t a good idea,Negative
Intel,"What I tend to do is look for YouTube benchmarks of builds I intend to go with. Like ""5700x3d 5070ti vs 5700x3d 5080"" then go through it until I see the resolution I play at. On some games the 5080 is 30% more typically, then on other games it's not so much.",Neutral
Intel,"What are your struggling scenarios that you want to upgrade almost the whole system? Games are not that hard to operate, except if you want absolute graphics quality.",Neutral
Intel,"Coffee Lake is old at this point, and there isn't really a good upgrade path. Even the top dog of that era the 9900k is quite slow by modern standards, and will be a bottleneck for most mid to high end GPUs. I guess you can choose to upgrade just the GPU alone and stick with the 9600k. Just know that in CPU limited games, you most likely will see a substantial CPU bottleneck.",Negative
Intel,"The main thing I am coming across is titles like Monster Hunter: Wilds, Borderlands 4 etc that are both poorly optimised and CPU intensive. In theory my current specs are right on the ""minimum"" specs to play MH:Wilds, but in practice I get barely a stable 30fps at 1080p, even using upscaling and low settings.    I have contemplated just a GPU upgrade (e.g. picking up a 30series GTX), anything newer and I assume I'll end up severely CPU limited. But then I still have a 6 generation old CPU and a few generation old GPU, so probably land in the same situation with the next generation of games. And a 3060 new still costs almost as much as a B580 or RTX5060, so doesn't seem cost effective.",Negative
Intel,That's why I'm contemplating a full CPU/mobo/GPU upgrade and keeping the ram/SSD/PSU.    Its just not clear to me what a good GPU match for a 13-14 gen i5 (or equivalent AMD) would be so I can keep my RAM. Or even whether it's a good idea at this point to hold on to my RAM (e.g. should I just wait until I can afford a newer system and go full DDR5?,Neutral
Intel,"There are 2 things we can probaly do:  1. Tweaking this old system to squeeze the most out of it for best performance at stable state while gaming. You won't get significant improvements but in other hand, it is free. Your risk is the temperature and voltage. 2. Generational upgrade that cost us minimal changes with most reusable parts.",Neutral
Intel,"Well, there's also the problem that your RAM 2666 is pretty slow for DDR4. Also, whether it's AM4 Zen3 or 12/13/14th gen, you're basically investing in a OLD platforms that's not only slower than modern AM5, but also has no future.   Honestly, i'd stick with Coffee lake at this point, maybe see if i can swap to a 8700k for cheap, and go with a low end GPU like a 5060 or B580 and deal with the CPU issues until prices normalize.",Negative
Intel,"Thanks, that makes sense. I kind of suspected that while my RAM and SSD were compatible with newer systems, but not actually very good anymore (given they weren't exactly cutting edge 7 years ago when I got them) - but it's good to confirm that.   I think I'll look around for cheap/second hand GPU options and otherwise wait around until I can afford a complete system update.",Positive
Intel,"No problem. Your SSD is decent, if a bit smaller capacity. I had this exact same model and it's in my dad's pc right now. 500GB is still ok for a system storage drive if u don't have a ton of stuff. Gen 3 speeds are still more than enough for daily use imo. You'll still need a extra SSD for games if you don't have that.   As for the ram, you could see if u can overclock it to 3000 mhz. If you don't mind used, then it's ok to migrate them to a AM4 b450/550 platform and maybe pair it with a Ryzen 5 5600x . You can probably get the pair for around $150-200 used and elevate some CPU performance issues you'll have. Granted, what I said about investing in old platforms with no future still stands, but if the price is right and you really need the increased CPU performance, then it could be justifiable.",Positive
Intel,"Arc B580 is a good budget card and leagues better then a 3050, just note it will probably struggle on high settings on 1440p. On tomshardware it scored 42.6 FPS on average for 1440p Ultra Rast which included God of War Ragnarök in there game selection.   If you want to play high settings consistently without frame gen at 1440p, I would spend the extra $100 for the 9060XT 16GB. It scored 40% higher then the B580, and cost 40% more. So you're getting same value wise, for price to performance 1440p Ultra.  Also note, Intel GPU's are still new and have the most vary performance with time,  so I would actually imagine the B580 is a bit better then the recorded benchmark I'm refrencing from.

Intel,"Depends on pricing, the B580 is a decent deal in the UK, you can get it here for £200 and a choice of a £60 game out of four options including BF6 so a no brainer for budget builders. Anymore than £200 or the dollar equivalent id just jump to a 5060 or better yet 9060XT 16gb. There will be some CPU bottleneck, but you can get alot of performance out of itself still.",Positive

Intel,"At 4K you’ll likely need to use FSR for some games to be playable/smooth, which is no problem since FSR 4 is pretty good.   I use FSR 3 for 4K with my 7900 XTX when I need it, but most games run on >100 FPS anyway and games like Overwatch even at 200+ FPS. If you really want Raytracing/Pathtracing you have to choose between FSR or low FPS",Positive
Intel,"Depends on your tolerance for 60 fps. If 60 fps is enough then go 4k. A lot of us don't play below 100 gps because it just doesn't look good comparatively, and you can't consistently get over 100 fps at 4k on a 9070xt. I have a 4090 and stay at 1440p.

With some exceptions like Stalker 2, where it's more like 60-80 fps.  Personally I would go 4K if you were getting a TV, but not if you're getting a monitor. To me the jump from 1440p to 4K on a monitor isn't worth it, but it's 100% worth it on a quality TV.  Also, I wouldn't be worried about having to use FSR. FSR 4 quality mode is as good as native anyway. Even performance mode looks great, especially on an OLED TV or something of similar quality.",Neutral

I play any souls like at 4k max settings with no issues and maintain either 60fps or exceed my 165hz monitor in fps. I’m really not sure what games would ever hold you back as far as gpu goes.

In 1440p you'll be able to play almost any game no problem, unless it's an extremely poorly optimized game.  Realistically if you're looking to game in 4k and want an AMD GPU, get the RX 7900 XTX, as it has 24gb VRAM in comparins to the 9070xt's 16gb VRAM, which most likely won't be enough for a decent amount of games in 4K.

Intel,"1440p. No brainer.  I don't recommend 4k, even on a 5090. 1440p is where it's at these days. Get a high refresh 1440p OLED.  I run a 9800x3d, 5080, and 64GB of RAM with a 240hz 1440p OLED. It's incredible. I upgraded to high refresh 1440p from 4k 🙂. 4k was a lot more viable when we were all stuck at 60hz.  I don't even use my 85"" 120hz 4k TV for gaming now.",Positive
Intel,2k is better,Neutral
Intel,4k with only 60fps in some games? It will get at double or triple that in the vast majority unless you are cranking to the max graphics in super demanding games. At 1440p I would be looking at 240hz monitors for sure. Pretty sure I was playing Wukong with the 7900xt at 100fps on second highest graphics settings,Neutral
Intel,"I also prefer at least 80 fps or more just for the reduced input lag, but 60 actually isn't too bad if you have a VRR capable monitor.  Especially if you use a controller, like on a TV for example.",Positive
Intel,"True, but 9070XT gets FSR4. With the similar raw performance but better upscaler, the 9070XT is a marginally better buy (without discussing differences).   Saying that as an XTX owner that plays in 4K",Positive
Intel,">16gb VRAM, which most likely won't be enough for a decent amount of games in 4K.  Why are you commenting if you don't have the knowledge base to make an informed remark?  16GB is still enough for 4K. 16GB is only a limitation when completely maxing out a very limited handful of games with ray tracing, and the 9070 XT is not fast enough to completely max out new AAA games with ray tracing.  Even newer Unreal 5 games like Stalker 2 doesn't use more than ~11GB of VRAM completely maxed out (without ray tracing).  The 9070 XT will also need upscaling in a variety of games, which reduces VRAM usage by a measurable amount.  The only reason to choose a 7900 XTX over the 9070 XT is if you can find it much cheaper, or you're planning on playing heavily modded games with huge textures.",Negative
Intel,1440p ≠ 2K,Neutral
Intel,"But for 4k the 7900 XTX is the better choice, specifically because of the extra VRAM. 9070 XT is more future proof, 7900 XTX is a better 4k card. 9070 XT i think has slightly better raw performance.  Future Proof = 9070 XT   Strictly 4k Gaming = RX 7900 XTX   Alternative = wait for RDNA 5 because the price for both 9070 xt and 7900 xtx will probably drop over time",Positive
Intel,">16GB is still enough for 4K. 16GB is only a limitation when completely maxing out a very limited handful of games with ray tracing, and the 9070 XT is not fast enough to completely max out new AAA games with ray tracing.  >Even newer Unreal 5 games like Stalker 2 doesn't use more than \~11GB of VRAM completely maxed out (without ray tracing).  You're literally specifying here without RayTracing, obviously without RayTracing 16gb is going to be enough. If you have to specify specific settings you cannot use to try and disprove me, then you're argument is trash. Also, the 9070 XT is CAPABLE of RayTracing, and if someones card is capable, their most likely going to want to play using those settings. But there is a VRAM overload, so people have to compromise. Because the 7900 XTX has 8gb more VRAM, you don't HAVE to compromise and you can max out RayTracing without having to worry about VRAM. You're literally cherry picking settings to try to disprove my point.   Also, what if i wanted to mod using my RX 9070 XT but can't because using 4K resolution with max graphics has used up all my VRAM and i have no more headroom? You said the only reason to choose a 7900 XTX is if you're planning on heavily modding games yet you clearly didn't take into consideration someone may want to mod with an RX 9070 XT as well. The RX 9070 XT is widely considered a premium 2k card, not 4k. And it's not considered 4k because playing with 4k max settings with RayTracing usually exceeds 16gb VRAM, and people LIKE RayTracing. So strictly for 4K, people will opt for the 7900 XTX.  RX 9070 XT however is newer, has FSR 4, more updated drivers. But the RX 7900 XTX has way more VRAM headroom, especially for people who want to use RayTracing in 4K, which the RX 9070 XT won't be capable of in a fair number of titles unless you manually choose the settings yourself, and even then you're leaving yourself no headroom for modding. RX 9070 XT is more future-proof in terms of performance, but RX 7900 XTX is more future-proof strictly for gaming in 4K, as games are only going to get more VRAM demanding.  7900 XTX is only better under specific uses, and this specific use being 4K. And that's SPECIFICALLY because of the extra 8gb VRAM.",Neutral
Intel,It's 2.56k and 4k is actually 3.84k,Neutral
Intel,"Uhmm ahhh akthuallii 🤓👆  Yes 2k is not 1440p but almost everyone uses it and people understand that by saying 2k, you actually mean 1440p. Fucking smartass.",Negative
Intel,"The 7900 XTX can't max out ray tracing at 4K, so that's a completely moot point. The amount of ray tracing that card can do at acceptable framerates will never make it go above 16GB VRAM.  And yes, I specifically said to get the 7900 XTX if you want to play games with huge texture mods, but you can still play modded games with a 16GB card just fine. I played a heavily modded Skyrim with almost only 4K textures, and it hovered at ~12.5GB  Sure, people like ray tracing, but that doesn't change the fact that neither of those cards can max out ray tracing - and keep acceptable framerates - to the point where it becomes an issue with regards to their VRAM buffer.  The only way you're doing max settings and path tracing is with performance mode upscaling, at which point you're just not maxing out that 16GB VRAM buffer. Case in point: https://youtu.be/8bEo1dgeRn4?si=Z3WwktPwxqDgsHYK  Max settings + path tracing, barely scratches 11GB dedicated.",Negative

Intel,GPU on top or bottom pcie slot?  All GPU cables plugged in and firmly?  Did you by chance flip the bios 2 mode on the GPU?  Download afterburner and set all settings to default. Then max out the power slider.,Neutral
Intel,I had the same problem when I upgraded my CPU. Turns out my CPU cooler wasn’t properly screwed down and was unevenly placed causing my CPU to have heat spikes and I was having major stuttering and lag. I was so confused because it was a far better and more expensive CPU. If you have an AIO make sure you removed the sticker or that the pump is working correctly,Negative

First, If my PC is off, I have to move my display cable to the integrated slot, then I turn on the PC and let it boot to desktop. After that, I open task manager and watch the graph for my discrete GPU. Obviously the igpu will have all of the fluctuations, but my discrete will stay flat for close to a minute. Then I open steam or YouTube and wait until I see repetitive motions on the graph for the discrete. In my case, I get tiny little mountains back to back.

Unfortunately I really think this may be a bad motherboard, especially with the popping and audio distortions you’re hearing.   Since it’s self built, some cables may not be fully seated. Here is the link to the digital English manual for your motherboard: https://download.msi.com/archive/mnu_exe/mb/MAGX870TOMAHAWKWIFI_English.pdf . You want to find the diagram showing what cables go where. I would:   1) specifically pay attention to the 24-pin power cable (a big ass, stiff ass cable that goes from PSU directly to MOBO, plug is labeled ATX_PWR on the diagram). Make sure it’s fully seated. If you want to unplug it and replug it, be careful as it will require some force but you want to be slow with it.   2) look at the two 8-pin power connectors for the CPU. It’s on the top left of the MOBO (labeled CPU_PWR1 and CPU_PWR2 in diagram). This ones a lot easier to plug and unplug. Make sure BOTH are plugged in and fully seated.   3) Confirm that the power connector to the graphics card is fully plugged in. Do that same unplug and replug. Examine the power connector for signs of damage (mainly burning/melted plastic).   4) You may have already done this, but fully reseat your RAM.   5) Make sure the audio cable is fully plugged into the MOBO. This is on the bottom left of your MOBO and is labeled “JAUD1” on the schematic.  IIRC it’s a funky looking plug, haven’t seen anything else like it.    Apologies if you have already done these steps. The only thing it can really be at this point is the MOBO or possibly GPU related, because your processor seems to be doing its job.

Intel,I appreciate the in depth breakdown. For the moment I am trying all the software settings and testing before I start ripping it back open.       During the installation nothing seemed out of place or funny but its been a while since I did a custom build and I can double check that everything works with that.,Neutral
Intel,thats good,Positive
Intel,Get a 3dmark score and compare to similar system scores in the results,Neutral
Intel,"Yes - in your original post you stated you enabled XMP. That could be the source of your problem. I would try disabling any RAM BIOS OC/double check and see if you did set it to XMP, Try Expo 1 or 2.",Neutral
Intel,"Fair enough. Look back through my comment if/when you do tear it open, I’ve made some edits to be more specific and concise. If it helps, I don’t think you’ll need to remove any parts to get to any of the cables I mentioned. (MAYBE have to uninstall GPU to get to the audio cable, MIGHT have to remove CPU cooler to get to CPU plugs, depends on how beefy it is).  EDIT: Also, if you do end up taking the side panel off, feel free to DM me some pictures of the inside. I can try to help more in depth as I’m available.",Neutral
Intel,That's good I guess. Thank you for the help,Positive
Intel,oh yeas good idea i completely overread this and my brain said same thing,Positive
Intel,It seems I mistyped. I did enable EXPO1 not XMD and changed the post to match.,Negative
Intel,They are both beefy....   But thank you again. I will reread them once I pop it open.,Positive
Intel,just means that it isnt the cpu and or mainboard. could be the gpu or the slot or some weird software stuff,Neutral
Intel,Ok got it. Could be worth trying moving to the more stable Expo 2 or disabling all together… sorry you’re having issues.,Negative
Intel,You may want to just shoot a short video or bunch of photos showing where everything is plugged in.   Take it slow and be sure to show everything.,Neutral
Intel,More ram because this is a amazing build,Positive
Intel,"Get fast 32GB DDR4 RAM (or even more). The rest of the build is well balanced and upgrade meaning completely new system (except PSU and storage). The GPU still good, but produce less fps in new games compare to 5070Ti (own both - personal experience).",Positive
Intel,RAM 32GB (16 * 2),Neutral
Intel,400 CAD for 3080 is good,Positive
Intel,You should also look into getting a new CPU as well that can help your FPS as well.,Positive
Intel,"That's more than I would spend on a used GPU, personally. Who knows how it used and how much life it has left in it? Before I spent that kind of money on a used GPU, I would save a little more for something new from the current generation, like maybe a 5060ti. Not only does it average right about 60fps in pure rasterizarion, without DLSS and frame generation in play, but you would also get the benefit of both of those things, which you will not have with the 3080.  The performance numbers I have were based on a Tom's Hardware review of the 5060ti. I suggest doing your own research, of course.  Good luck!",Neutral
Intel,"A 3080 no, a 3080ti I would consider it but would also check the 4070 if prices are to your wallet. I own a 7800xt and it's a solid 1440p card. Pair it up with a 5700x and you have a solid combo with vram to spare... RT is... capable.  Also, make sure your psu can handle them.",Neutral
Intel,"100%, for the right price. Ive been recommending a used 3080 or used 3080 Ti for over a year now. I also recommend a used 6900 XT. You can get one for like 375 on ebay. Insane value imo",Positive
Intel,"I'm playing arc raiders with a 3080 10gb and 5800x, on 1440p monitor. With graphics set to epic, I'm getting 90-100 fps.",Neutral
Intel,"30 series ain't too old, just try to haggle it down some.",Neutral
Intel,"Seems expensive for a 3080, but it’s still a solid card",Positive
Intel,Yeah the 3080ti is still a very strong card. A 3080ti 12gb is about 20% stronger than a 5060ti 16gb while being about the same price. Though the 5060ti has more VRAM and will have have driver support further down the road while having access to the new DLSS.   Its a reeaally tough choice. 20% extra FPS is more worth it IMO versus the extra Vram,Positive
Intel,yeah it is,Neutral
Intel,"For sure. I can’t afford to upgrade a ton right now, but I figured I could do it piece by piece, starting with my gpu for now yk",Neutral
Intel,Thanks so much!,Positive
Intel,I’ll definitely take this into consideration,Neutral
Intel,Wab a 3090ti?,Neutral
Intel,"It’s not a ti.  So potentially 2GB less memory, fewer CUDA cores, and 5-15% less perf. I still think it’s a deal but might want to amend your post.",Negative
Intel,what board and psu do you have?,Neutral
Intel,and you get bonus a.i. cores 😅,Neutral
Intel,"Considered it, but too expensive in my country (used market sucks) and it's a power hog. But a beast of a card.",Negative
Intel,"I can’t remember the exact variant, but I have a b450m matx motherboard. When swapping the gpu I’ll probably be switching out the psu for a 750w or 850w",Neutral
Intel,"that would be wise.  are you eventually going to AM5 in the near future? if not, i would be looking into a slightly newer cpu for better single thread performance and additional cpu cache for gaming.  pick a few out and price watch them. since they are end of life they might go up in price",Neutral
Intel,Check Amazon returns. They have a few older Am4 overstock chips their trying to clear out of inventory that hasn't sold. You can get a really good deal on a chip rn thats better than your current.,Positive
Intel,Sick! Any specific ones worth checking out?,Negative
Intel,"Only 2 worth keeping an eye on upgrade wise from you 3700x since that chip was such a huge value buy is the 5600x3d, 5700x3d. The ones on Amazon get snapped up really fast but you can find one reliably on ebay. That CPU will give future proofing for a long time and keep you from having to make the switch to Am5 and will work really well with current Gen CPU.    Because honestly if it wasn't for ramageddon the normal choice would be to make the jump to Am5 because of the value to performance on the newer 7800x3d and 9800x3d chips.",Positive
Intel,Ramageddon fits rn😅,Neutral
Intel,"Valid point. I’ll keep this in mind 🙏. Regarding the spike in ram prices tho, wouldn’t it make sense to just buy used? I’ve seen some exceptional prices compared to what they’re at right now",Neutral
Intel,"If they could hit close to 5070 performance and price it at $399, they might just go from 1% to 2%!",Neutral
Intel,holy shit. these cards are not cancelled?  are they still coming?       theres still hope for Celestial?  https://preview.redd.it/daxvcoxft06g1.jpeg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b3dba05fcdcfb82799679baccf7b3c3b05073f6,Neutral
Intel,"Over 50% more power, so it should be over 50% more faster.  So slightly faster than the 5060ti and 9060xt.",Positive
Intel,"Spicy.  Nice to see a unit with some power.   Really, their target only needs to be match the 5070/5080/9070XT range.  If they can do that and actually get volume built, they'll sell a ton.   I've other very interesting thing they could do is go heavy on vram, not because it's needed for games but because it's needed for bigger at home AI models.   Drop a 32gb just for fun, or larger and let people run bigger models than can even fit on 4090/5090 cards.  Create a cheap alternative to the pro cards.  Don't even worry about speed.  Just gotta fit model sizes.",Positive
Intel,Going to be a very interesting card. In the age of expensive GPUs...,Positive
Intel,"At that TDP it better be very, very close or better than RX 9070 XT... Ok, fine RX 9070, non XT.",Positive
Intel,I’d sell my 4070s to support them if they can hit the same amount of performance level. I know sounds redundant as hell but need to have more competition in the gpu space,Neutral
Intel,Hmm for 300watts isn’t that close to 9070xt and 5070TI power usage? Does intel in general use more power? Just from efficiency standpoint and power usage that seems where it may land unless it is power hungry and inefficient compared to competition? Any info is appreciated. Trying to line this up as well 👍.  Either way glad to see it’s finally coming out. I wish they announced it sooner though would have tried to get it over the 9070XT to be honest.,Neutral
Intel,I’ll be watching this with interest. I love my b580 and I’ve had 0 issues with it regardless of whatever crap about them gets spouted online. Never had a crash or driver issue related to the card and the driver update have been coming hard and fast bringing improvements   If these are priced right I’ll be upgrading and replacing my wife’s 3060 with my b580,Positive
Intel,Motherfucker I just bought a B580 because I thought this thing was a myth!,Neutral
Intel,"Lotta people hoping for 5070 performance who will be pretty disappointed. I'm not saying this will be 5060Ti level necessarily, but probably best we can hope for is something between 5060Ti and 5070 performance but with 16GB of VRAM, in the $350-$399 range.",Negative
Intel,Gross.  You guys know higher tdp is bad right? It’s literally a measure of power consumption.,Negative
Intel,"The B580 is 4060 performance at almost 200 watts, it's probably gonna be 4070 levels.",Neutral
Intel,"""5070 Performance!""",Neutral
Intel,They can make it $150 and it still won't increase market share.,Negative
Intel,Well if Nvidia pulls a crucial and stops selling consumer cards then Intel has a shot!,Neutral
Intel,Just from sales standpoint 1%->2% means 100% more sales. Which is allright ?,Neutral
Intel,"At 300w TDP it better be, but definitely not at that price.",Neutral
Intel,"Can't wait for first qtr of 2027 to see them!  Honestly quite annoyed with this launch, they are seemingly having issues at this point. Battlemage has been out for a whole year with no news, only leaks of the 700 series cards.",Negative
Intel,"Judging by the late timing maybe they were ""uncancelled"" =p",Neutral
Intel,"That's assuming performance scales linearly with power consumption, I'm not saying it doesn't but that's not really something we can verify without some hard data.",Neutral
Intel,Oof I'm hoping around 5070,Neutral
Intel,I'll take that. The speed bump that comes with fitting everything in vram for AI outclasses raw power by a mile,Neutral
Intel,With the price of memory right now dont count on it.,Neutral
Intel,Honestly if it’s 399 and hitting 5070/9070 performance. I’m buying in a heartbeat,Positive
Intel,"Not to ruin your day, but selling your 4070S just to ""support"" them is IMO a stupid decision.  The support you ""provided"" is completely negligible, literally a water droplet in a lake. In exchange, you get a far worse experience in your performance, software, power efficiency and compatibility.  All of that just so that you can feel right in your own PoV lol. Selling it doesnt change the fact that you already gave Nvidia your money.  You will be of bigger help by just keeping your 4070S and instead recommending Intel GPUs to your friends and other people who want to build a new PC (assuming Intel nails the pricing right). Spread the word instead, and dont sabotage yourself.",Negative
Intel,But with TDP performance goes in pair. NVIDIA nailed it and they are low TDP high performance. Thats why they are 90%. But to get some traction you have to compete in performance much more then in TDP. Thats what most games care for - FPS.,Neutral
Intel,I doubt you're the only person here who was smart enough to put that together u/flatroundworm.,Negative
Intel,4070 and 5070 are extremely close.,Neutral
Intel,"""4090 Performance!""",Neutral
Intel,"Why not? As others have mentioned, their market share is already successfully increasing. There's no reason to think a new desirable GPU wouldn't continue that trend.",Negative
Intel,"Exactly.  If they were smart, they just build what others don't and build something no one can currently compete with.  Build big and take the sales.   There are three challenges.  One, it needs to be good enough to be on par with the 5070/5080/9070XT.  It needs to be a viable alternative, not 30% worse but on par, however they need to do it.  Two, they need to build a feature no other manufacturer has.  This is the vram part.  Go big.  Make it do something no one can compete with for a period of time   Three is the bigger challenge, but it might or might not matter to certain people.  This is cost and efficiency.  If the cost can be competitive to the 5070 and 9070 XT, they will get considerable sales, not like 1%, but as many sales as they can build for.  The second part efficiency.  If they can be highly efficient, they could market a budget option for AI use, not necessarily fastest but efficient for the work load.  This too could promote a significant sales volume just because it costs less at scale.   But, if very little is as achievable, you can always have a feature no one else has, and you can still sell quite well.",Neutral
Intel,If it's 32 Xe cores (up from 20 on the B580) that'd likely put it somewhere more like a 6800XT or 5060Ti :(,Neutral
Intel,It prevents someone else giving Nvidia their money while propping up intel - if more people did it like this mad lad it would make a difference,Neutral
Intel,"I bought the card used lol , no way I’d pay over msrp . But your statement stands true .",Neutral
Intel,It’s closer to 4070ti. It’s a 23% improvement over 4070. Putting it a little slower than 4070ti but faster than 4070S.,Positive
Intel,"""4100 Performance!""",Neutral
Intel,"It doesnt change the fact that the 4070S was already sold. Nvidia already got their money from that unit. Selling your 4070S DOESNT RETURN what you already gave to nvidia's pockets lol.  You can think of it as **paying for someone** else to get a 4070S.  That is the thing that people like dude above is missing.  In the end, you just sacrificed your own experience for nothing. Its a ***Lose Win*** situation.  I aint gonna be stupid to sabotage myself just for a temporary feeling of being right and morally superior, a feeling that I did the right thing, because in the end, its inconsequential, and I just fucked myself in the process, and what is waiting for me in the end is just regret lol.  You might as well ***keep*** the 4070S, keep the better perf, software, efficiency etc etc and ***just focus on preaching*** to people to buy Intel GPUs (assuming its good value). ***Thats a win win scenario.***  Also, you dont want to mindlessly give Intel your own money. You want them to earn it. Buy Intel GPUs not because you want a 3rd player, but because you know its a good product and helping out a 3rd player in the GPU market is just a nice bonus.  If Intel half assess the B770's pricing and launch, and you still bought it just ""to support the underdog"", you are just incentivizing Intel to continue half assing their approach",Negative
Intel,"Damn I was thinking mobile, those are like 10-15 percent",Negative
Intel,"Private profile, shilling. Jog on buddy, no one knows what the card will be like.",Neutral
Intel,"You keep repeating the idea that “the 4070S was already sold, so nothing changes,” which tells me you’re stuck in the sunk cost fallacy. Nvidia getting money from the original sale is irrelevant to the next decision. What matters in economics is marginal demand. When someone sells their 4070S and chooses Intel for their next GPU, they remove one potential new Nvidia sale (the buyer of the used card may otherwise have purchased new) and simultaneously create one new Intel sale. Those marginal shifts are exactly how incumbents lose revenue and challengers gain market share. Sunk revenue doesn’t grant Nvidia permanent immunity from switching behavior.  A strong second hand market absolutely hurts Nvidia’s future sales. It lowers the effective cost of GPU ownership, pushes price sensitive buyers into used units instead of new ones, and reduces Nvidia’s pricing power. This is standard industrial organization theory used goods cannibalize new goods. Selling the 4070S does not “give Nvidia money,” it gives someone else a path to avoid paying Nvidia at all. Then replacing that card with Intel means Intel gets fresh revenue while Nvidia gets zero. Combine both actions and the net effect is Nvidia loses one new sale, Intel gains one new sale. That is the literal mechanism by which competition grows.  And pretending that “one person doesn’t matter” ignores how collective marginal actions scale. If even a small percentage of consumers switch from buying new Nvidia cards (~€600 on average) to Intel instead, the foregone revenue becomes massive. For example, 100,000 people doing this is €60 million Nvidia doesn’t get and €60 million Intel gains. That’s not “inconsequential”, that’s enough to change pricing strategy, product roadmaps, and R&D priorities. Markets don’t change because one individual defects they change when many individuals do, and that only happens if people stop rationalizing inaction with the sunk cost excuses you’re using.  Your whole argument hinges on a single transaction worldview, as if each GPU purchase is isolated. But the GPU market is dynamic. Nvidia’s future behavior depends on demand elasticity, competitors’ traction, and consumer switching. Selling your Nvidia card and buying Intel is a strategic choice that weakens incumbent dominance, strengthens pricing competition, and signals that alternatives are viable. Yes, you shouldn’t blindly buy Intel if the product is bad but when Intel is competitive, shifting demand is exactly how you incentivize innovation and better pricing across the board. In other words you don’t “sacrifice yourself,” you just refuse to keep subsidizing the monopoly.  In short, your logic collapses because you ignore marginal effects, second hand market cannibalization, collective action, and basic microeconomics. The 4070S sale is sunk the choice of what you buy next is what actually shapes the market.",Negative
Intel,"So what does a private profile got to do with it?  Or did you just ignore all my points.     The fact that said the word ""shilling"" is clear indicator you didnt understand what I said.  Did you want to go full Ad Hominem Fallacy by using my own profile against me while not doing anything with my statements LOL?",Negative
Intel,"Give it time and that guy will switch it up and come back with ""consumers don't matter anymore to Nvidia, only data center"". These corporate bootlickers are very narrow minded.",Negative
Intel,"The fundamental point you have is that a hypothetical card will be worse than the 4070 super, which is silly to say because we just don't know.",Negative
Intel,"Which still doesnt change the fact that itll be less efficienct and have weaker software. The 4070S draws 220W, and has access to a multitude of features at far greater availability and support, that is Nvidia's biggest strength that even AMD stans wont deny.  It still doesnt change the fact that you already gave money to Nvidia.  You could use your own statement against OP and yourself. Why would you sell your GPU when we dont even know how good it is? Lol. You are dumping a good card for an unknown one.  And I already said the following:  >You might as well ***keep*** the 4070S, keep the better perf, software, efficiency etc etc and ***just focus on preaching*** to people to buy Intel GPUs (assuming its good value). ***Thats a win win scenario.***  >You will be of bigger help by just keeping your 4070S and instead recommending Intel GPUs to your friends and other people who want to build a new PC (assuming Intel nails the pricing right). Spread the word instead, and dont sabotage yourself.  Tell me, wheres the shilling here?",Neutral
Intel,It might run Crisis with the Arc card but not very well with the GeForce.  Crisis has been a very bad experience for the last (I think) half a year on Nvidia cards because Nvidia driver has broken some DX9 compatibility,Negative

Intel,"Yeah I know, I just find it funny that a 5070 (and any GPU currently supports by Nvidia) can't run a 18 year old game.",Negative

Intel,"I just bought exactly those components, a 5070TI, 9800X3D, RM850X, 2TB NVMe, AIO and a new chassi.

Intel,"It's a solid PC - if you already owned some of those components. But I wouldn't buy that new. (Owning the same MOBO, RAM, PSU and roughly chip)  What you want is today's equivalent of that setup, which some have listed below.   The problem with this build is that AM4 is no longer in production, so if that 5800X gets a bit slow, you can't upgrade it alone, you'll have to upgrade the motherboard...which means also replacing the RAM.   So what you want is an AM5 setup where you CAN select cheaper components that you can then upgrade later if need be.  Good luck and welcome!",Neutral
Intel,"maybe consider AM5 rather locking yourself in am4, although you will have to pay for those hellish ddr5 ram prices. Plus with am5 you have access to pcie gen 5, and future proofing till 2027 case as said by others is a bit too expensive, you can shave mayb 150-200 for a good looking one and put the money in a better gpu / cpu and for psu, you can get a full atx one with gold or plat rating for less",Neutral
Intel,"https://pcpartpicker.com/list/PffWVF  I dont think I cooked, but Jesus Ram is fucked",Neutral
Intel,"My only suggestion is to not get a 2TB SSD. From my personal experiences having your SSD as purely systematic files allows the OS to boot quicker and update without fail. If you want the SSD to download games faster sure, just make sure you get 2 separate SSD cards. Alternatively most HDD will suffice as a cheap alternative to still have a butt ton of storage. Also 32GB ram is a good starting point, I don’t see anything eating that up immediately, but if you consider recording your game play, discord, 10+ web browsers and other background uses, not to mention the possibility of streaming, I advice getting more RAM (2x32GB is faster than 4x16GB) but that’s only if your plans are professional",Neutral
Intel,I don't know much about AMD cooler quality but they have their own coolers that come with cpu usually. So you can save money there,Neutral
Intel,That is a lot of money for that PC. If it were me I would definitely drop the $400 case and get a 5070.,Negative
Intel,"Bad value. I got this PC for $1800 in September:  https://www.microcenter.com/product/689586/powerspec-g722-gaming-pc  Even considering RAM prices, it would be still a bad value vs. what you can get in a prebuilt. Micro Center has great prebuilts.",Negative
Intel,DDR5 ram may kill his budget.,Negative
Intel,So I should check better prices for the CPU and GPU?,Neutral
Intel,"oh thank you for that, TBH I didn't realize it was SFX. Are SFX more expensive that regular ATX? I definitely need to check that",Positive
Intel,"Damn man, thank you so much for this. After reading comments, I get that AM4 isn’t a good option so yeah I was think about researching about AM5 to start with it and you dropped a full build so yea I can totally work from this, checking prices.  I’ll check the components in more detail later, but again thank you.",Positive
Intel,"this is an excellent build, you can also probably shave off a good chunk of money by not exclusively looking at 6000 cl30 ram",Positive
Intel,thank you bot,Positive
Intel,"Thank you so much, some others also mentioned about the AM5 and I think it would be the best option but now I need to research about it",Positive
Intel,Thank you!!,Positive
Intel,Would it be better like a 512Gb SSD and 1Tb HDD?  Also not thinking about streaming or something more professional but I will think about 2x32 ram. Thank you!!,Positive
Intel,Probably terrible coolers and loud,Negative
Intel,"And then he absolutely should not be building the system himself. Its just following clear instructions for a few hours for a beginner, that experience should not make you pay $200 more for AM4 + 5060 compared to a 9800X3D + 5070 a system",Negative
Intel,"If that is your budget, I'd generally advice on not getting a $350 case lol. Try to adjust it so you can hop on to AM5, I can't really do the list right now.  Is there some realistic way you can come close to [this](https://www.costco.com/ibuypower-element-gaming-pc-desktop---amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d---nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-12gb----windows-11-home---32gb-ram---2tb-ssd.product.4000384603.html)?",Neutral
Intel,"Costco has rebuilds on sale until the 21st of Dec, pretty sure they are better deals than this. $1500 is 5070 and Ryzen 7 9800X3D",Positive
Intel,"Usually, yes. It generally costs more to make things smaller. Montech has a good deal on an 850w PSU that ranks well in the PSU tier list.",Positive
Intel,He provided a great build for you. I was gonna suggest you get an 9070 XT myself. What screen resolution are you planning to game at?,Positive
Intel,My pleasure  If its out of your budget you could start with a cheaper CPU as the 7800x3d is fantastic but a lot of people might never really use the extra L3 cache and you might be served well enough with a 9600x for example.  We can also take a step back on the GPU and go back to  the 5060TI you chose or a 5070 to also save some money but probably dollar/performance for straight out videogames nothing beats the 9070xt  Then as i mentioned if you are open to other vendors we can probably save some purchasing select pieces from newegg or the mobo/cpu combos from msi  Just let me know if i can help any further,Positive
Intel,"No worries,  The biggest problem right now is that in the last 2 weeks, DDR5 ram has shot up 2-5x in price due to AI datacenter greed and such.  So suddenly a bunch of us are pumping new life into our existing AM4 setups instead of buying new AM5 PCs. Just today I replaced my 5600x CPU with a 2nd hand 5700x3d, which should max out the performance of my AM4 build.  I WAS planning on buying a new AM5 pc with a 7800X3D chip and 6000MHz ram, but the price suddenly jumped by a LOT!  Btw, if you have the budget, try and aim for a 70-series card or AMD equivalent like the 9070. I've always been a 60-series user (960, 3060Ti), but each time I buy it, I always regret not saving 2-3 months extra to get the better performing 70 series. They seem to be the sweet spot for price vs performance, even more so if you go with an AMD equivalent.",Negative
Intel,"From what i know they ain't bad, they're mid. Which is sufficient",Negative

Intel,"If you're going to go overboard anywhere, the case is probably the place to do it since you can carry it through multiple builds. That said, USD$350 is way more than I'd pay for a case personally.",Neutral
Intel,Tysm!,Neutral
Intel,nowadays somehow prebuilds are cheaper than custom built computers. Check if any is available near you. coz 5060 ti for 1700$ is just too much.,Neutral
Intel,"That is true, I'd guess my answer came from the same place. $350 would be way too much for me lol",Neutral
Intel,"In my mind was like… that’s the “cosmetic” part of the PC, like the RGB and stuff that would like to be nice on the pc so that’s why I picked that case but thinking the way you said it’s also a really good point",Positive
Intel,Thanks,Positive
Intel,"I'm waiting on them to make something that can replace my 3070ti, the minimum performance I want for me to justify an upgrade would be a 9070xt / 5070ti  Intel, i'm waiting, and i'm willing, so show me what you can do.",Positive

Intel,"I was considering getting an Arc, but it didn't seem like a good fit for an AM4 board. It was also kinda too low end to be a worthwhile upgrade from my previous card, while the 9070 XT was one.",Negative
Intel,"I would've got the b580, but it only has 8 lanes.  So I got the 9060xt.  I'm playing on a gen 3 system, so l would loose a bit of performance.",Neutral

Intel,"A770 Owner here. Was between 4060-7600XT-A770 this year, video games was a second focus but wanted to go more for productivity (in a budget). 4060 was fine, but the 8gb VRAM make me go for the other 2 options, mainly if I get to edit very big things in high res., it would be hard to do.  And between 7600XT and A770... The A770 gets 4070 performance on video edition, and Intel codes are far better than AMD. Gaming performance they are almost the same... So far very happy with my purchase.  Since the start of the year, doing the same workflow, with driver updates I got to shave a total of 5 minutes on each video render. At the start was 20m, rn is 15m with the same type of edition. And driver bugs? 0, enever needed to reinstall drivers.",Positive
Intel,The $250 price point is compelling to me for the specs.   But does it handle games well? That's what I want to know; $250 is a pretty big purchase for me right now.,Positive
Intel,"I mean i sort of do? My ultra 7 155h laptop has an arc igpu, if that counts",Neutral
Intel,"Had a A770 and it was great, only reaon I moved away was VR. If they could support VR I would go back. Prices are better, it worked really well, the software was great and dev support was amazing.  Halo Master Chief Collection wasn't running well. Raised a support ticket and in a month they fixed it.",Positive
Intel,"They don’t make anything powerful enough for what I want out of a gaming PC but they’ve made strides and if they keep it up, I could see them continuing to improve, maybe having xx60 competitors in a couple of years.",Positive
Intel,"I use an A770 16GB for gaming on the 4K TV. Mostly older or lighter games, but in Forza Horizon 5 with the help of XESS there's no problem with high-ultra settings in 4K. hitting rock solid 60fps",Positive
Intel,I have a A770 and I'd say it performs about on par with my 3070 for most games I play. Honestly interested in seeing what more they can do with better hardware design and continued work on improving their drivers.,Positive
Intel,"A770, really liked it for it's price point, even though it was a pain at first. Solid at 1440p.   I'll get the b780 if it ever releases.",Positive
Intel,I've got the A770 16 gig and it seems fine.  Hard to tell with games if it's my GPU or the game being next gen ready. I came from a gtx 970 so it felt like a massive upgrade. I remember Balder's gate being real low fps in act 1 on the 970 but very decent on the A770 at 1440. Hunt showdown also gets 90+ fps in busy areas but has had issues dropping to very choppy fps when things are happening close. With Hunt it's very hard to tell what the issue is as it has frequent issues that effect many gpus at the same time. Like a friend playing on amd had different issues at the same time as I did. Honestly couldn't tell you if I've turned the graphics up from low since I had that issue. A770 runs armored core 4 really well to the point that I haven't had to mess with any settings or check fps.,Positive

Intel,If they had a card that could compete with Nvidia and AMD high end I would consider it. At the current performance tier with B580 as the best card it doesn't interest me.,Neutral
Intel,"I love to not buy Nvidia, just as soon as someone makes a better product",Positive
Intel,Had a a770 in my Linux but sadly I had to many issues getting it to play certain games and running it in my main  rig which at the time had a 6700xt it ran worse than the 6700xt so now it’s just sitting in it box not sure what to do with it,Negative

Intel,"I don't use it, but I appreciate there being more options available for people.",Neutral
Intel,It's okay at best,Positive
Intel,B580 at 1080 so far so good. Can lock 60fps ARC Raiders max settings or drop down from max a level and 120fps,Positive
Intel,"I picked up a B580 for stoopid cheap secondhand and am using it to learn about local LLMs on my linux rig for future home automation. Works fairly decent, but my benchmark options are limited on linux for now. It runs a bit warm at idle without an undervolt (55° - 60° C).",Positive
Intel,If they ever release a single fan battlemage card akin to the a380 I'd buy one for my sub 5L build for sure... Tempted as it is by the sparkle a380 but I keep hoping for better especially since the b50 pro is a thing.,Positive
Intel,"Not me really, irs rare to find one here also",Negative
Intel,It’s great for a budget build but I wanted something higher-end so I went for the 9070XT,Positive
Intel,I wish I could. But my friends have outspoken this idea from me. Ended up with a laptop and RTX card in it.,Neutral
Intel,For me the problem is that Intel's best offering is about as fast as 4060. I got no use for that.,Positive
Intel,"I would swap to ARC, but the rest of my system needs an upgrade first. I don't even have ReBAR support.",Negative
Intel,"Was looking at an intel one of them for a long time, until I realized most FEA & CFD software suites require nvidia graphics cards and so that killed that idea.",Positive
Intel,I am interested but I don't think it is worth replacing my 2080 Super.,Neutral

Intel,"I just got an a380 for 120 and put it in my plex server.  Love it, barely spins up for 4K to 1080p transcodes including HDR to SDR mapping.  Makes zero noise.",Positive
Intel,"Yes, got a B580 for MSRP, and put it into my custom Steam Machine!",Positive
Intel,"I mean, is it? While the price to performance *seems* to be good, from what I’ve heard, the drivers kind of suck, and it doesn’t really work well with actual budget CPUs.  It’s good on paper, but it’s not really a mature product yet. I’d guess that by the next generation, they’d be more caught up with the competition at that price range.",Negative
Intel,"I have one in my jellyfin and its been amazing doing 3 transcodes at a time and not sucking up too much power, along with some misc server tasks like trickplay. Looking into the b580 for my personal computer currently. I've heard people say the drivers aren't good but personally I havent really had a problem with them.",Positive
Intel,"I have an A770 in my rig, genuinely never had a problem unless it was Fallout 3",Positive
Intel,I had a B580 near launch. Was my replacement for a 1080ti at the time. It was totally fine for my use case. I did upgrade to a 4080 later but that was more due to my use case changing (built a sim racing rig with a large format 4k TV) than the performance of the card itself. I was also quite partial to the understated looks of the card,Positive
Intel,"Ive used plenty of Arcs and have enjoyed the performance and compatability.  The 1 weird thing is in one older game I played, the game defaulted to my PCs AMD iGPU, and wouldnt run on the Arc without disabling the iGPU in the BIOS.   Probably just an issue with the engine only knowing to expect an AMD/Nvidia GPU",Positive

It also has a dedicated RTX 3050Ti, I have been surprised that leaving the RTX disabled I'm still able to emulate PS2 and 360 (Xenia) perfectly. I only use the RTX for heavier Steam games due to heat output and power consumption.

Intel,"Got an Arc B580 for the price/performance ratio, coming from an RX 5700 XT. Was a good bit of an upgrade in a lot of newer games. Honestly think it's a great card for that purpose.  Unfortunately, I ran into poor performance that was a no-go for me. Yakuza Kiwami had a huge issue (ran at like 50-55 fps with horrible lows that made it jittery, while my 5700 XT easily pushed 144, which makes sense, it's basically a PS3 era engine with better assets). From what I can tell, 0, Kiwami 2, and YLAD all had the same issue, and they got fixed over the course of a few years. The problem with that is that 0 was reported on the forum like 2 years before it was fixed. I was in the middle of a playthrough and couldn't just wait for reasonable, playable performance. I even tried DXVK and got a big boost (like 90-100ish), but it was still very unstable.  So you really do have to beware of older games still, despite the drivers having improved a lot and being overall solid. Some other DX11 titles ran perfectly fine though.  OpenGL performance? Forget it. Necesse uses Java and OpenGL and I managed about 70fps before using Mesa for Windows to get a boost. Still wasn't ideal compared to my 5700 XT, once again (and AMD isn't known for OpenGL performance on Windows lmao).  So overall, I think it's a great piece of hardware with mostly solid drivers, but it's not good enough for me on the driver side and I don't want to wait. It lasted 2 weeks before I returned it and got a 9060 XT 16GB (which is again a good bit of an upgrade from the B580, so the extra cost doesn't hurt as bad. I've been waiting for so long for an upgrade that made sense to me).  This was all in the middle of last month. Got my 9060 XT on the 30th.  I'd also like to note that they did alleviate most of the CPU overhead issues recently, so my 5600G wasn't an issue in games that did run well, like The Finals (actually ran extremely well with maxed out settings, and XeSS is actually really good on the Arc cards).",Positive

It's usually not a bottleneck (the GPU can't process data as fast as it comes in through the bus), but it's a noticeable one when you're low on VRAM and the GPU needs to fetch data in the system RAM through the PCIe bus. Mostly an issue with 8 GB cards like the 5060.",Neutral

Intel,"No, I don't do a lot. The main goal wa to use it as a display GPU, but the AV1 encoding is a nice bonus. I run OBS in replay mode (10 minutes) in the background and this intel GPU is used for encoding.  I want my Nvidia GPU to not have any monitors connected to it, so I can switch between using it in my host OS and in the VM, here's an example of how it works: [https://youtu.be/3fiXFv85iRU](https://youtu.be/3fiXFv85iRU)  This allows me to for example stream a game directly from a VM to my TV and still use my PC to do something else, like for example few weeks ago we played Trine 2 with my brother, when I was running the game in both the VM and host (one copy on Nvidia and one on Intel) and we played multiplayer together.  I used to use the VM to play everything like year or two ago, but the Nvidia drivers on linux improved significantly, so nowadays I don't use it nearly as much, but I still do from time to time. Plus it's always nice to have a backup plan for running some anticheats.",Positive
Intel,"I'm using looking-glass. It's a bit different than parsec, it works by copying frames from the main GPU's framebuffer into the shared system memory segment and then to the 2nd GPU's memory. No compression and very low latency (I use virtual display in my Windows VM that I can set to 500Hz, which gives me around 2.5ms of added latency in total).  I also use Sunshine and Moonlight when straming to a TV or remotely to my laptop or phone. I have the cheapest server in OVH that I use as a VPN, so I can access my PC or share some services over internet (like my personal cloud for example: [https://cloud.yayuuu.pl/index.php/apps/memories/s/pKqfn86wLLy6xZM](https://cloud.yayuuu.pl/index.php/apps/memories/s/pKqfn86wLLy6xZM) ), so I can game from anywhere, just login over SSH to my home server, wake on lan PC, start a VM and connect using Moonlight).",Neutral
Intel,"Good point, I guess it isn't necessarily the best gaming CPU, but I quite like its speed for compiling etc.  Getting some 5xxx CPU seems like just a small step up and wouldn't be cheap. And anything even higher would mean basically replacing everything: Mainboard, RAM and CPU. Going with a lower core count and higher boosts might be better for gaming, but would feel like too much of a downgrade.  Ironically most games, which I play besides Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, are such old titles, that both GPU and CPU are complete overkill. And lately I found just far too little time for gaming in general to make it worth it with the current prices to get some DDR5.  Edit: I just checked and at least according to Wikipedia the Ryzen 5000 CPUs aren't clocked all that differently. Its successor the 5900X has a boost of 4,8GHz, but same core count and same L3 cache and same TDP.",Neutral
Intel,I don't know what that means in layman's terms. Does it cap bandwidth like older hdmi resolution? Does it limit my kid's Minecraft terrain generation range? Does it mean I only run 69 mods on Skyrim instead of 420?,Neutral
Intel,"To be fair I don't play *that* many different games, but I haven't come across one that simply doesn't work. The biggest game compatibility issue I ever ran into was with StarCraft Remastered not rendering at full resolution. My theory is that they were specifically checking for Intel (what would've been only slow iGPUs at the time) and disabling high resolution. Blizzard fixed it though thankfully.   This video is over a year old, so things have only improved since then. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the issues shown have been addressed: https://youtu.be/Y09iNxx5nFE",Negative

Intel,"Your not a clown, you’re the whole circus buddy",Neutral
Intel,"Wait, if you don't connect your Nvidia to monitors, does that mean the thing you see on monitors is only rendered by the Arc?    So, is it like how you stream from game pass? Where you let other PC run and calculate the game (your VM in this case) and then stream the game on your host OS?    Are there advantages in doing this? How are the graphics compared to directly using your Nvidia?  When you say that you rarely play on the VM nowadays, do you mean your Nvidia is connected to the monitors? Or is there a way to split the task without VM?  Also when you played Trine 2, does that mean the game looks better on TV than your PC? Since Ark is weaker.  Sorry for asking many questions lol",Neutral
Intel,"😂 Just has less bandwidth, but still really damn good.",Positive
Intel,"It caps the bandwidth. But that's fine because it's not strong enough to even utilize the full bandwidth that 16 lanes would provide. And those extra lanes would just increase cost.   This *may* be a problem on an old motherboard, because 8 lanes of PCIe *may* be too little (idk, didn't see any tests). But 8 lanes of PCIe4 are more than sufficient.",Negative
Intel,"You need to change your expectations if that is your point.  If you buy a stick of RAM today, it is going to run at half speed if you don't go into the bios and correct it. If you don't want to tune your PC, don't build one yourself.",Negative

That's basically what laptops are doing this with multiple GPUs. I just set these environmental variables in the steam's launch parameters: DXVK\_FILTER\_DEVICE\_NAME=""NVIDIA"" \_\_NV\_PRIME\_RENDER\_OFFLOAD=1 \_\_GLX\_VENDOR\_LIBRARY\_NAME=nvidia   and it will run on Nvidia. I can do the same with any other app, like browser, blender, etc. The screenshot shows an example of the game running bare-metal on nvidia-gpu and being displayed on intel GPU.  To not repeat the same parameters with every game, I've made a simple bash script that just exports these variables (and few more, like DLSS upgrade, etc), so I just type ""setenv %command%"" in steam lauinch parameters and that's it.  When running a VM, I use looking-glass, which is different than streaming the game to another device over LAN (like in your example with gamepass). Looking-glass uses shared memory to copy frames from one device to another, so it only works within one PC, but the video is uncompressed and with minimal latency (like 2-3ms of added latency). This is essentially the same path as offloading rendering but with one additional limitation - windows forces vsync, so I need to run as high refresh rate inside windows as possible to reduce latency. I use Virtual display adapter that allows me to set up to 500Hz and run desktop without any physical monitors attached.",Neutral
Intel,"Trine 2 is not that demanding, both GPUs can run it at max settings just fine. This is also true with a lot of older games. With new games it wouldn't work like this, but there is another way. Linux has a built-in multiseat, that allows logging in 2 different users at the same time, giving them access to different monitors, input devices, etc. I could use a 4k dummy plug to enable multiseat on that device and stream from there to the TV, but I don't have it configured right now, as I still need VM sometimes, so usually it's enough.",Neutral
Intel,"So like a v6 Camaro? Not as fast at the suped up v8, but still better than a Corolla?",Neutral
Intel,"I think it’s less about “not getting the full performance”, and more about it being a fire hazard.   Especially when you pay that kind of money for it.    In fact, one could argue that the consumer shouldn’t be able to make your product into a fire hazard, even if they aggressively fuck around with software parameters. As long as no modifications were done to the hardware - it should be perfectly safe. Sure it may not function properly, but it shouldn’t melt itself.",Negative
Intel,"Your ram clocks actually depends on your other hardware, its not the case for gpu. Its fine that you like it, but other may not, and nothing on the box say i need to understand something about overcklocking\\downcklocking. Also i doubt that some random dude will spend time to play with your gpu settings if you buy prebuilt, you will just get it as it is.",Neutral
Intel,"More like the transmission than the engine. PCIe lanes determine how much compute (horsepower) can get to the CPU (Road) so if your GPU (Engine) is performing really well but is bottlenecked by PCIe lanes, you aren't really getting that level of performance.   It's also why this objection to the Intel cards is a bit of a moot point. If you are running a v6 than you don't need the best transmission, the car isn't making the power to necessitate more HP to the wheels.",Neutral

For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch.

Intel,"what is triggering this? I can let my amd pcs run all day without any crashes. (7900XT,5700XT and 6900XT)",Negative
Intel,"Are y'all playing on televisions? HDMI isn't really optimal for modern monitors, with DisplayPort being the better spec for computer graphics.  Not criticizing, just curious as to use-case.",Neutral
Intel,You try install last chipset driver ?,Neutral
Intel,"Bummer you're having issues. Hopefully AMD gets it straightened out for you. Out of curiosity, why did you decide to use HDMI on your monitor instead of display port? I thought HDMI was mostly used for TVs nowadays.",Negative
Intel,So it's the driver that's why that happens 😡 and it's not fixed?,Negative
Intel,Thank you for your service,Positive
Intel,"I've had the ""device_hung"" error and the best drivers are those you are on.   AMD needs a lot of help with their drivers...",Negative
Intel,Any update mate?,Neutral
Intel,"No, radeon drivers update cannot upgrade your CPU so that it would stop bottlenecking your GPU.",Negative
Intel,"Had the same issue, just ddu and reinstall the drivers manually, problem now is with my hardware monitor screen not working, I have an aorus board with an internal hdmi, that is not being detected, will try to reinstall chipset drivers",Negative
Intel,"multi gpu? got the same problem with rx 6400 + 7900xtx. plugging in my secondary display to 7900xtx fixed the issue, but what's the point of secondary gpu if its not working properly...",Negative
Intel,"Workaround:  Win+P and disable the second Monitor in iGPU, then start adrenaline and you can enable the second monitor again  software should be okay then",Neutral
Intel,"I'm the opposite, I just want adrenaline app to stop everytime I right click on desktop or open file explorer.... Bruh",Neutral
Intel,"yeah same, my experience with 25.10 was terrible, had to DDU it once to get back my CPU metrics in Adrenalin, then DDU’d it again to go back to 25.9.2 since games were stuttering.",Negative
Intel,Same.,Neutral
Intel,"Not stable, ddu install 11.1 and lag in old dx11 mmo game(BDO)  Same as 10.2, 9800x3d with 7900xtx, i can keep 144fps in town , 11.1like  fps 60-65 and lag spikes  Im go back to 9.1",Neutral
Intel,"Both 10 and 11 are shit with 7xxx series, myself and most others have gone back to 9.1 or 9.2. Might be alright with the 9070, might not",Negative
Intel,I'm playing it on 7900 GRE with FSR4 INT8 with no issues.,Neutral
Intel,na it works the problem only occures when using PathTracing and you are not going to play on an AMD card with PT anyways and especially not a 7700XT,Negative
Intel,"I played recently the latest patch of Cyberpunk 2077 with RX 7700 XT with drivers from February this year, 25.2.1 and had no issues, no stutter, no lag, no crashes, the problem is with path tracing or ray tracing something, you don't have to use that even and it lowers fps probably for very little visual gain.",Positive
Intel,If it still crashes set RTX Global Illumination to Static.,Negative
Intel,"pretty sure anti lag was causing my system to freeze up when in arc raiders on 25.10. turned it on and issues, turned it off and haven't had issues since",Negative
Intel,"Optimizing has nothing to do with fixing crashing, generally, that would be bug fixing.",Negative
Intel,"The only Redstone component that will work through the driver for upgrading existing features (like FSR3 FG) will be ML FG, but only for games that have FSR 3.1.4+(and FSR FG), as they’ve already announced in a GPUOpen article quite a while ago.   Ray Regeneration (RR) and Neural Radiance Cache (NRC) require dev implementation since they’re much deeper in engine code/inputs.",Neutral
Intel,"Does BO7 have ray tracing? Where is that feature mentioned, would be keen to read about it 🤓",Neutral
Intel,"Itll probably work through optiscaler, but a game like indiana jones has locked dlss inputs, so you need dev implementation",Neutral
Intel,"And all my USB devices dropped for a while, far worse experience than the usual double screen flicker & it's done.  Edit: seems like that was because of iGPU driver for my Zen4. In the end and after 6+ reinstalls, I'm stopping on 25.9.1 and have Vulkan working again.",Negative
Intel,What is wrong with CP? Just got my 9070 after 10+ years of nvidia :o   Ah nvm i see it.,Negative
Intel,Ugh,Neutral
Intel,"Most likely when your distro provides a kernel update.  I'd give this a quick read: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-update-and-see-what-graphics-driver-you-have-on-linux-and-steamos/  Pretty much the default is that you will be using the Mesa driver collection and they were last updated yesterday.  The fixes there do not correlate with the ones in this thread (I think).  As long as you are on a ""cutting edge"" type distro then you can expect that update in the next few days/weeks.  If you are on a ""stable"" distro that doesn't update often, you may be waiting a realllly long time.",Neutral
Intel,"Get what exactly? Features? Bug fixes? Optimizations?   Every 2 weeks there are new Mesa driver updates with bug fixes and performance optimizations. As for features, you have to wait a few months for versions with big numbers (25.2 is soon updating to 25.3, adding Anti-lag 2).   Depending on your distribution, you can get these updates faster or slower.",Neutral
Intel,"Linux doesn’t work like windows. You get updates directly via Mesa stack. When your distro provides mesa package update, that’s when you get driver updates, and they’re completely different from windows branch.",Neutral
Intel,just uninstall it I prefer manual check myself.,Neutral
Intel,So AMDs default driver overclocks and doesn’t reflect that in the values?,Negative
Intel,Same issues here i underclocked it but this new update just made it worse,Negative
Intel,ok it is still crashing ... complete reboot :(,Negative
Intel,"I feel like that crash is more on DICE's side, since Nvidia users get the same exact crash, although less often.  I tried everything I saw on the internet, nothing really works. Sometimes I can play for hours on end, other time game just crashes randomly after 10-15 minutes.  I am going to try to downgrade to 25.9.1 and see how it fares, since I remember that driver being really stable for me (6800XT).  Edit: been playing for 4 hours, no crash yet. Never had such a long session without the game crashing.  Will update in the next few days.  Edit 2: haven't crashed once, been playing at least 2 hours every evening.",Negative
Intel,Okay.,Neutral
Intel,I’m hoping Valve’s new steam machine will push them on that since it’s RDNA3 based.,Neutral
Intel,The RT/PT reflections leading to CTDs issue? We're working with CDPR to resolve this - it's not caused by the driver software.,Negative
Intel,"Stuff like this is honestly bugging me.  First AMD card and while it is okay to have some driver issues, stuff like that shouldn't be a thing at all. It can't be that some bugs keep existing for multiple months let alone more than half a year.",Negative
Intel,A much more fundamental thing like playing video in a window without stuttering took 3 or 4 driver updates.,Neutral
Intel,"> One year already...Cyberpunk 2077 not fixed yet.  On year, I did not know.  I was thinking of a 9070XT earlier in spring, but choose... differently",Neutral
Intel,welcome to amd,Neutral
Intel,Yeah hoping it works. I guess the point about crashing with easy anticheat was the fix? Doesn't specifically mention but it was with raytracing enabled I was getting the crash. I suppose we shall find out.,Neutral
Intel,"Weird. I was running 10.2 and things were running fine for the most part. I kept getting a pop-up on launch saying there was a known issue with that driver and Arc Raiders though, so I rolled it back to 9.2 and had more issues on that release than the one with the stated problems.  My fan control profile broke and stopped tracking gpu temp so last night I did a clean DDU install back to 10.2.  Of course 12 hrs later the new release drops haha  Hopefully Fan Control continues to play nice if I just update",Negative
Intel,Same. Never even had Ryzen master installed.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm receiving the same error in Event Viewer, but I have installed Ryzen Master. Most likely it's also a component of the Adrenalin drivers for system tuning and monitoring.  Registry search shows two keys for ""AMDRyzenMasterDriverV30"" (in both CurrentControlSet and ControlSet001): Computer\\HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\AMDRyzenMasterDriverV30  The ImagePath points to: C:\\Windows\\System32\\AMDRyzenMasterDriver.sys and the file exists. It's valid.",Neutral
Intel,25.2.1 had no pink artifacts on my Pure 7700 xt Sapphire but i switched to 25.11.1 and got it now also and also some flickering.,Neutral
Intel,What is redstone?,Neutral
Intel,What's weird is Black Ops 7 has ray regeneration.,Negative
Intel,"I'm afraid it may be released in January like they drop new major this year like AFMF 2 upgrade, FSR, etc..",Neutral
Intel,vsync issue fixed with win 11 KB5068861 update.,Neutral
Intel,had no issues with vsync on 25.10.2,Neutral
Intel,works fine for me,Positive
Intel,I agree.  I also have this issue  Weird is if you turn on amd overlay it fixes itself,Neutral
Intel,"That it did, lol. My only complaint.",Neutral
Intel,"Not a problem on Linux with Wayland. Ever.   Main reason I ditched Windows 11, constant screen tearing and input lag made me go crazy.",Negative
Intel,The new AFMF features were added in 25.10.2 - Still waiting for AFMF 3.0 at this stage,Neutral
Intel,Suggest if you are using powertoys to stop... After their last game update it was crashing left and right. Powertoys was cause. I only crashed once and I believe it was cfeen blanking was cause for that. I was away too long.,Negative
Intel,"Fps drop over time? That's a game issue, it's got a memory leak",Negative
Intel,"What kind of FPS drops? I was having dog shit frame pacing, and hardcore drops to like sub 60 FPS at 1440p medium/high with a 6950XT. I went through every setting and found that anti-lag was the culprit. Once I turned that off it all went away. Then with future frame rendering it got even smoother. Now I can hold 100+ FPS at all times, sometimes peaking over 200 FPS in some scenarios. And frame times are smooth as butter.",Negative
Intel,I’d settle for bf6 going one entire game without drivers crashing the game and freezing pc,Neutral
Intel,"I'm also having this ""problem"" with driver 25.10.2; I haven't tested it with 25.11.1 yet.",Negative
Intel,Crashes?,Negative
Intel,I have this problem in all games.,Negative
Intel,"Hello, I've been having this issue and I have exactly your gpu and cpu, whenever I played valorant and I alt tabed many times the screen goes black and keyboard become unresponsive but I can still hear friends in discord and they can't hear me, after conctacting valorant support and messing with alot of settings I think  what fixed it for me is to add these in windows defender exclusions : C:\\Riot Games\\VALORANT\\live\\VALORANT.exe   C:\\Riot Games\\VALORANT\\live\\ShooterGame\\Binaries\\Win64\\VALORANT-Win64-Shipping   C:\\Program Files\\Riot Vanguard\\vgc.exe   C:\\Program Files\\Riot Vanguard\\vgm.exe   C:\\Riot Games\\Riot Client\\RiotClientServices.exe   I hope this helps",Negative
Intel,"DDU was only ever for switching GPU families, e.g. Nvidia or Catalyst to Adrenalin.",Neutral
Intel,"Sad to say I am having the same issue. Did you find any workarounds, or just downgrade?",Negative
Intel,"You don't need to make it work on Adrenalin, Battlefield 6 already has FSR 4 support integrated into the game, so you don't need to override, just turn off FSR 4 from Adrenalin.",Neutral
Intel,Works on 25.10.2. I have been seeing ppl said it doesn't work on this driver. It also didn't work on 25.10.1 for me as well.,Negative
Intel,Epic version runs just fine.,Positive
Intel,Cyberpunk GOG last version patch runs fine on this driver.,Positive
Intel,"Hey there, can you give an example of how this looks now versus how it's supposed to?",Neutral
Intel,are you able to install driver only with the newest drivers? When i choose minimal or driver only it still install full version of the software anyway. Only 25.9.1 works perfectly.,Neutral
Intel,Yeah... it can happen. I was already locked outside windows after a bsod with my old nvidia card. I had to use a linux usb drive to fix it through the command line.,Negative
Intel,It's most likely the same as I've described here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1ow4in7/comment/nop2o04/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1ow4in7/comment/nop2o04/)  But yeah unfortunately seems like all you can do for now is either roll back to 25.10.2 or disable your iGPU if you don't use it,Negative
Intel,probably because those issues are build specific.  I've not had any freezing or locks on any drivers this whole year.,Negative
Intel,"The game is booting, this message was for the 25.10 they just didn't removed it",Negative
Intel,I don't know your system specifications but in many cases setting the BIOS to PCIe v4 could help.     Try change in your bios,Neutral
Intel,no I hit alt R opens right away.  And i did an upgrade install over top of 25.10.2 no DDU or AMD clean up utility.  When you say you did a clean install was that just from control panel and remove?,Neutral
Intel,"First time yes, i downloaded with -s letter, but the last time i downloaded smth like -combined(1.6 gb). All two's is for WIn 11.",Neutral
Intel,"To be clear, are you able to confirm that VRR is disabled after you alt-tab? Do you have a display-side OSD to verify?",Neutral
Intel,"Good call, it caused nothing but problems for me and pretty severe. Were talking driver timeouts with black screens and even a couple bluescreens.",Negative
Intel,"Not even 7000s have support for FSR, you'll have to stay on 25.9.1",Negative
Intel,My 9070 xt crushes while I try to use fsr 4 on new drivers,Neutral
Intel,Why don't you try it and let us know if you can. Would be helpful for lots of us,Neutral
Intel,It's in Redstone. Still not out yet,Neutral
Intel,Didn't work for me...,Negative
Intel,Wait until you see how much your browser's cache is churning...,Neutral
Intel,Why cant you use Adrenalin? I'm using it on 25.9.1,Negative
Intel,I just received a windows extension update for my LG monitor. If you can boot up go check.,Neutral
Intel,The last time I had this problem it was a RAM issue.,Negative
Intel,I have this for my ThinkPad laptop with its internal display. Good to know I'm not the only one.,Positive
Intel,"if it happens, fill in the bug report that pops up. more reports will help AMD identify the issue better.",Negative
Intel,I have DDUed the driver before upgrading. I still face the GPU crashes during display standby.,Negative
Intel,"Wait, chipset drivers uninstall too? I'm going to have to fix that on my system...",Negative
Intel,Do u reintall already up to date chipset drivers?,Neutral
Intel,You should use the Factory Reset installation in the AMD Driver Installer so it removes the newest AMD Adrenalin and install back the correct Adrenalin driver.,Neutral
Intel,"I don't have a DisplayPort to HDMI 2.1 adapter to try, sorry.",Neutral
Intel,doing so (separation) will create a freak out shitstorm part 2.,Neutral
Intel,> People misunderstand and thought its like pre rdna stuff.  It is. They've simply bundled two separate drivers together. RDNA1/2 are still stuck on the same 21033.x branch while RDNA3/4 have moved first to 22021.1009 and now 22029.1019.,Neutral
Intel,Is it combined though?  7900 XT Driver: ......amd.com/drivers/whql-amd-software-adrenalin-edition-25.11.1-win11-nov.exe (25.20.29.01 ?)  6800 XT Driver: ......amd.com/drivers/whql-amd-software-adrenalin-edition-25.11.1-win11-s.exe (25.10.33.03 ?),Neutral
Intel,All it takes is one random Reddit comment with some upvotes spreading misinformation and you will see people posting articles about it,Neutral
Intel,"You have two differnt drivers installed and running at the same time, one for APU and the other for GPU? is that what you are saying?",Neutral
Intel,Combined only as far as the two driver packages are now in one file. RDNA1/2 are still stuck on 32.0.21033.x branch. RDNA3+ are on 32.0.22029.1019.,Neutral
Intel,Last driver was branched right? I never updated coz I had just fidled with the files to make FSR4 (INT8 or whatever its called run) and didn't wish to do it again...,Negative
Intel,Can we please have a fix for the 7700 xt artifacts showing? It's been ignored for so long. Using hardware acceleration on chromium (and not just that) causes pink artifacts everywhere.,Negative
Intel,Thank you for communicating,Positive
Intel,Unfortunately happens to me too. So for me it’s a big issue as I can’t update to this driver until it is fixed 😰,Negative
Intel,"I have a dual PC setup, one system with a 9070xt where I have seen this bsod related issue, mostly when toggling HDR.  The other system has exclusivly an RTX 3090 that also has the same HDMI 2.1 related system bsod, but Nvidia driver instead.   It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.   While digging into my issue, I wanted to see if DP2.0 / uhbe20  compatible display would have these issues, but my current display only has HDMI2.1 and dp1.4.  Hopefully someone else had experience with them on 4k 240hz.",Negative
Intel,Thank you AMD my bad for getting upset,Positive
Intel,Thank you.,Positive
Intel,Any word on when noise suppression will be fixed? I would actually lowkey love a right up and why it’s failing. Would be cool to see the technical details if that’s possible. (I’m actually more interested now on why it’s not working vs just getting it fixed).,Neutral
Intel,Thank you!,Positive
Intel,There's a long-time standing issue with Chrome and hardware acceleration. Will that ever be made a priority?,Negative
Intel,Redstone when?,Neutral
Intel,"LG OLED CX and newer are good monitors.  I am using it with my PC and PS3, PS5, Blu-ray 4K Player...  I must say that that was my very first actual driver issue with AMD.",Positive
Intel,Not always true. HDMI 2.1 has more bandwidth than dp 1.4. I have a ASUS pg32ucdm and HDMI looks better and uses a lower dsc ratio. I have a Nvidia GPU in my main PC however.,Neutral
Intel,"Yes, my 9070XT is paired with a 5600X hooked up to my TV for couch gaming. I have a separate PC with a monitor for desktop gaming. My TV doesn't have DisplayPort, very few did when I bought it.",Neutral
Intel,"I currently run a gaming monitor as my primary one, with DP, and a plain old Lenovo office monitor as my second one. It only has HDMI, so i wouldnt be able to use it with DP.  I assume this may be the case for a lot of people. Getting a ""higher spec"" 2nd monitor really isnt a priority for me, as i just need a second screen for productivity when working instead of gaming.",Neutral
Intel,Non pc monitor tvs are sometimes cheaper especially for larger sizes. I’m on lg c5 oled 42inch and it only has hdmi…,Neutral
Intel,"Not universally true, hdmi and displayport depending on the version supported are very comparable.   Dp 1.4 Vs hdmi 2.1 is where hdmi has more bandwidth, before this dp was the easy choice.",Neutral
Intel,"> Are y'all playing on televisions? HDMI isn't really optimal for modern monitors, with DisplayPort being the better spec for computer graphics.  ~~Tell this to Valve, who are about to bring out a gaming-focused mini PC which **only** has HDMI 2~~",Negative
Intel,"This was true prior to HDMI 2.1 but no longer the case. However, monitors with HDMI 2.1 do still cost more than those with DP1.4 which has similar albeit slower bandwidth.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, I am on a television. ""HTPC gaming (and turbo tax) from the recliner master race""!",Neutral
Intel,> Are y'all playing on televisions?  Do you guys not have phones?,Neutral
Intel,LG OLED TV as a monitor. I have LG OLED CX which comes with HDMI 2.1.,Neutral
Intel,My game keeps crashing due to the same. I want this fixed ASAP. You'd think they'd test the biggest recent releases before publishing an update.,Negative
Intel,"I am also having a ton of crashes in BF6 RedSec, but I'm not getting any errors. Game just freezes, then crashes.",Negative
Intel,"I got a new pc 2 days ago and i literally cannot downgrade my drivers without amd forcing me onto the latest, even if i download the more stable drivers directly. Got any advice?",Negative
Intel,"I kinda fixed it by turn off XMP/EXPO running the ram the lowest bus, still crash to but 1 crash every 2-3 hrs still better than 15 minutes.",Negative
Intel,Why does it seem like driver quality/support has gotten substantially worse this past decade? Are we running out of skilled software engineers or is hardware just getting too out of hand?,Negative
Intel,there are multiple reports of lower gpu usage with 25.9 and above.. after going back to 25.8 I have 15%+ fps  I guess the constant crashing with rdna1 cards is also not related to these drivers,Negative
Intel,"Tried but didnt work, tried the 25.9.1 and get error that no Software is installed tried the auto update to 25.11.1 again and same error with open and shut down again",Neutral
Intel,"Thanks a lot mate, i tried everything and adrenalin not worked but after yours advice it's fine. Thank you!",Positive

Intel,"25.10.2 just straight up didn't work for me when trying to play Arc Raiders (constant UE crash when loading into a match), in fact it actually gave me a popup when launching the game to downgrade to 9.2.  Only driver since switching back to AMD to give me issues.",Negative
Intel,Thanks for testing it,Positive
Intel,"I posted before in an arc raiders thread, but I've had zero issues with my 7900gre on 25.10.2. Playing since launch. I don't use any sort of overlays and play in borderless windowed always. Performance is locked on 140+fps native res 1440",Positive
Intel,I thought FSR 4 was only on RDNA 4? 🤔,Neutral
Intel,My thoughts exactly. Thanks.,Positive
Intel,Ohh okay. Yeah I don't use any of that lol. Hopefully it won't give me any issues. Plan on playing it after FF7Rebirth.,Neutral
Intel,I tried that before and amd antilag off. I tried all the suggestions.   Been really happy with Bazzite so haven't been back in windows for 2 weeks,Positive

Intel,"Damn, didn’t work for me last driver either. I can get FSR4 to work in other games just not BF6",Negative
Intel,Sorry for not replying in time with the pictures but I just saw that on Twitter that Beat Saber and AMD are now aware of the issue. The distorted flickering issue on the walls.  https://xcancel.com/BeatSaber/status/1993629046802882685  However there's another issue. I had not actually tried to use an Index at 90Hz until the other day. I discovered that the latency bug is back for 90Hz mode. As in I have to adjust the photon latency to ~5ms in the Steam debug commands to make it usable but not fixed. Just like in the the drivers before 24.12.1.   120Hz mode still works fine.,Neutral

Intel,"I had randomly black screens with 24.2.1, this was annoying as hell. Had to DDU the Driver and went back to 23.11.1, after this everything was fine.",Negative
Intel,Does fsr 4 work on 25.9.1? I thought the only driver that works without having to change any files and risk a ban online is 23. 9.1?,Neutral
Intel,"I had to rollback to driver 25.9.1, start up Star Citizen, switch the renderer to Vulkan, exit game, start SC again to verify it's working with Vulkan, then reinstall the latest driver again. Now it works, just don't switch it back to DirectX. No idea who dropped the ball on this one but Easy-Anticheat sure doesn't like the atidxx64.dll.",Neutral
Intel,I'm not sure. However when I install the driver it states that I cannot use adrenaline and gives me a link to the newest driver. Wondering if there is an earlier version of adrenaline I need to install.,Neutral
Intel,What do you mean extension update??? Do you mean lg firmware update or something Ina  windows update? Where do I find this?,Neutral
Intel,They do not.,Neutral
Intel,"Well, I used the system before the latest updates normally, for maybe half a year. Installed every update without DDU. I wanted to triple boot, formated the drive, left windows to install stock updates and drivers, went to install chipset and GPU driver and voila, every wakeup, just before I could type the pin, kernel panic and shutdown. DDU, just the driver, installed again, black screen. Went into DDU again, wanted to see if I missed anything and without reading, uninstalled everything AMD related, went into windows, installed chipset drivers from vendors site (ASUS) and then the latest GPU drivers, and havent had issues. I have a monitor connected via DP and a TV via HDMI.",Neutral
Intel,Dont buy an adapter. Most of them are trash and dont put out the advertised resolution and refresh rate. Not to mention most of them dont support vrr or HDR.,Negative
Intel,The one linked in the release notes is combined. (in the sense that it's two drivers in one executable) (And 1.6GB)  .....amd.com/drivers/whql-amd-software-adrenalin-edition-25.11.1-win11-nov-combined.exe,Neutral
Intel,"AND is taking away one additional driver feature per day, you say?",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, I’m talking about 25.10.2 (posted the other day here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/s/nNunS1QlFX ). If you go to AMD download page and select “GPU” you get a file that has a different dimension from the one you download if you choose “CPU”. If you do the following steps 1) DDU (or AMD CleanUp Utility), 2) install CPU drivers => GPU not recognized or with a generic driver. If the you install the GPU driver you get the GPU correctly recognized and a yellow esclamation mark on the integrated. To have both VGAs working at the same time I have to download the AMD Auto Detect package (the file name ends with “minimal_install), but Adrenalin App does not open.",Neutral
Intel,Thank you for explaining it before the rage baiters go nuts.,Positive
Intel,I've been following this one pretty closely. Unfortunately the fix *just* missed 25.11.1 release cycle; we hope to get this out in the next one.,Negative
Intel,"I have a 7900XTX and have this issue at times. It normally clears quickly on its own, but seeing pink pixels on the screen worried me that I had an issue with the actual hardware",Negative
Intel,"I totally understand. if you're running with an affected display config, you should be fine on 25.9.1 or the 25.10.1 preview driver for BF6. We'll get this out as soon as we can.",Neutral
Intel,"Appreciate you reaching out with this - that's an interesting data point to consider.  In this case, the quirky behaviour with HDMI 2.1 + FRL was attributed to a change made in the display stack, I don't think it explicitly involves display stream compression to repro, just high enough display bandwidth (though I could be mistaken)",Positive
Intel,"Interesting. I've been experiencing random BSODs on my PC too on a fresh Win11 install too, I was also suspecting it was something to do with auto HDR toggle but I didn't know for sure.  I'm running 180hz 1440 LG panel but I don't recall if it's using hdmi or DP. I've also never experienced BSODs until the last week or two, since i did a fresh install and I've had the same monitors/PCs for a long time.",Neutral

Intel,"Ah ok, that definitely makes sense if you're using a TV. Hope they straighten it out for you soon.",Neutral
Intel,What I did is get the 25.8.1 drivers shut off the fluid motion frames and in Windows set bf6 to run full power on your graphics card. Try some of those things and see if that helps you.,Neutral
Intel,"I tried to reinstall the chipset drivers, the same error, tried to install the drivers from gigabyte site the second screen worked but uninstalled adrenaline and it ran the auto update that disabled the secondary screen and the issue of no adrenaline opening came back, going back to older version, thanks AMD",Neutral

Intel,For me playing it with path tracing on eventually the game crashes. Had no issues playing with ray tracing: psycho though.,Negative
Intel,Amen to that. Not a single crash since the game released on CachyOS. (9070 XT),Neutral
Intel,Thank you! Exciting keen to see what it’s like,Positive
Intel,"It has nothing to do with the lack of vulkan support, even when fsr4 comes to vulkan, the game still needs ray regeneration implementation from the devs, you cant use optiscaler through dlss inputs, like you probably will be able to in fx alan wake 2",Negative
Intel,I suppose is going to be fixed as soon as Amd Redstone go out. Basically is going to add every tecnology that Path tracing needs to work. Off course the devs would have to implement them in the game too,Negative
Intel,"The issue is if you try to use path tracing. Which to be fair, you probably shouldn't unless the miracle of them getting Virtuous to implement Ray Regeneration in Cyberpunk happens.",Negative
Intel,yes i tried it ... maybe it is because of the 7800X3D ... i really dont know... i will wait for the next patch ... should come tomorrow 18.11. ... but i have read so many threads and i am not the only one...,Neutral
Intel,Hmm fair. For me on 9070XT if I had raytracing enabled it would crash most regularly on loading back to the menu after extraction which was annoying but at least not game destroying lol. But yeah annoying enough that I turned RT off entirely.   I hope this means I can turn it back on because the game runs well enough for it.,Negative
Intel,"Yes. So far, so good. I'm not 100% sure what fixed it.      I uninstalled both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master standalone applications. Deleted the ""amdryzenmasterv"" keys. Rebooted.  Then I installed Adrenalin and used the Ryzen Master installer in Adrenalin (Performance > Metrics > Install Ryzen Master).  I think this problem might have something to do with a handshake breaking between Ryzen Master and Adrenalin, after upgrading just Adrenalin.   From now on, I'll probably do clean installs, removing and reinstalling both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master, through Adrenalin Performance tab.",Positive
Intel,"My last two processors are ryzen amd, my last three video cards are amd radeon and next one will be amd also, nvidia has driver issues as well, to be honest.  But yes, some issues are too annoying and updating drivers is lottery at this point. I would advice against updating drivers unless you need it for specific new game or have the latest video cards - rx 9070 \[xt\]  or 9060 xt .  I should have sold the 7700 xt and bought 9060 xt 16gb instead but too late for that now and it has problems as well, so lottery as i said, its a risk.",Negative

Intel,yeah same with 25.11.1 25.9.2 works for me,Positive
Intel,"25.10.2 was the previous WHQL, so also yes :P",Positive
Intel,"Huh, seems to be running in DX12 for me, as reported by MSI AB, and FSR4 is working",Neutral
Intel,Which driver version and does it still crashing?,Neutral
Intel,OK I will install it now and test it and get back to you. Give me 10 mins.,Neutral
Intel,Yuppp. It does not work on bf6 but it works on ark survival ascended for me. Seems it might be a bf issue. I saw ppl saying they were getting more fps with this driver in BF6 but I think they didn't realize it's using FSR 3.1 and not 4.,Negative
Intel,I'll work with the engineer from that ticket check if that issue has somehow regressed.,Neutral
Intel,We've not been able to reproduce this internally so far. Can you remind me which GPU (was this a 7900XTX?) + connectivity method you're using?,Negative
Intel,Try using DDU to uninstall your current drivers and do a clean install of the 25.10.2 combined drivers if you havent already (you can find it here):  https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-25-10-2.html,Neutral
Intel,"Yup just need to say ""No""",Neutral
Intel,"whew thanks, good think i noticed it first before updating. i have 25.10.2 and 25.9.2 here and they both have windows 10 along their filename so i might as well asked.",Positive
Intel,I don't see how it would work on 23.9.1 lol,Neutral
Intel,"Did you use DDU to uninstall the drivers and then reinstall using a driver installer from the AMD website? I found this guide yesterday and it was extremely helpful, specifically step 8:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1lnxb8o/ultimate_amd_performance_fix_guide_stop_lag_fps/",Neutral
Intel,I did it this morning before the new driver and confirm chipset drivers were untouched,Neutral
Intel,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.  More people use HDMI than what people think and those TVs don’t always have a DP connector at all.,Negative
Intel,"ah, that explains it. Thanks. :)",Positive
Intel,"What if one does not check release notes? V25.10.2 point to different packages, for installing both CPU and GPU you had to download the AutoDetect package (named “minimal install”). Obviously I’m referring to AMD driver download page.",Neutral
Intel,"Okay, as long as they have a workaround for that... I was planning to get a 9060XT, but also keep my 6700XT for lossless scaling frame gen, was worried the branching would affect that..",Neutral
Intel,"What a mess. I have rdna2 and 3 on the same PC, so combined driver is the solution for this? Or auto detect is the only way?",Neutral
Intel,"Damn, that's a huge relief to hear. Most of the frustration came from not knowing whether the issue was even acknowledged.   Thanks a lot for the update.",Negative
Intel,What about Noise Suppression not working since 25.9.2?,Neutral
Intel,Finally. The last driver without pink artifacting was 25.4.1  It has been 7 months. AMD Matt acknowledged the bug on [the amd forums](https://pcforum.amd.com/s/question/0D5KZ000011WpJJ0A0/pink-square-artifacting-chrome-discord-and-steam) 5 months ago.  Please let it be fixed with the next driver update. So many 7000series users are on the verge of swapping to Nvidia.  https://i.redd.it/ywrg9at3lp1g1.gif,Neutral
Intel,"what about whatever changed post 25.3.1 for multi monitors? Any driver 25.3.1 and older i can run my main at 200hz, my side at 165, and my third at 60 without issue. Any driver newer than 25.3.1 and running my main at 200hz then playing a game will cause the second monitor (165hz) to flicker, glitch, and freak out the entire time, until the game on the main monitor is closed. Dropping to 165 on the main monitor down from 200hz \*fixes\* the issue but, i paid for 200hz and would like to be able to actually use it again.  (7700xt system)",Neutral
Intel,Hell yeah 🙂 amd I appreciate you see the issues Iv been a fan boy for a long time and I know it will be fixed,Positive
Intel,"Hi. Sorry, I thought this was pretty common as I've had this issue with two different systems and 3 AMD GPUs across 2 generations. [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1jayump/chrome_full_screen_freezes_after_switching_to_amd/) [Or here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/3890720/parts-of-screen-freezes-when-using-chrome) Chrome (or other Chromium browsers, I've had this happen with Edge too) in fullscreen, with graphics acceleration enabled.   Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind this only actually matters if one protocol or the other is **actually** limiting bandwidth for the [resolution * FPS] you want to display on your monitor  For instance, DP 1.4 can do ~25Gbits/s, which translates to roughly 1440p @ 240fps, or 4k @ 120fps  If you have proper cable into HDMI 2.1, it should be able to do ~42Gbits/s, which would instead be 4k @ 190fps  Read up the wikipedia tables for bandwidth specs and resolution / fps / bit depth rates for more",Neutral
Intel,Yeah most people are still have dp 1.4 monitors though. No way I'm swapping my monitor just for dp 2.1 as it's just too awesome. Although these tandem OLED screens look interesting... Hmm lol,Positive

Intel,Oh that's nice! I'll look into it when I get the chance.,Positive
Intel,Cool. Thank you,Positive
Intel,I might turn on ray tracing in like a medium or low setting just for shits and giggles or screenshots but I don't plan on playing with it on all the time since I'll also play at 1440p so I don't wanna have a really bad experience 😖,Negative
Intel,Exactly! It's insane. I can't believe running through a translation layer is more stable than running native,Positive
Intel,"but i dont know something is also wrong with 25.11.1 ... AMD Adrenalin randomly vanishes from tray     i dont want to roll back to 25.9.1 :-(    but this version was the last which was good so far      maybe when we have luck amd is able to provide next time a ""perfect"" driver without any issues?",Negative
Intel,"Could be it, nothing hardware wise at all and just software too.     Yeah, you're not the 1st I've read that says they have issues on the game.     If you're crashing and the system reboots it does make me think of some stability issues and not really just GPU, but I'm guessing you've already tried stability tests and using the system without OC+A-XMP/EXPO disabled.     Once upon a time I remember reading some people, on other instances and other games, having crashes like that (complete reboot) due to PSU instability as well.     Good luck!",Neutral
Intel,That's strange. My game defaulted to everything maxed out including running ray tracing and I haven't noticed any issues. The game runs incredibly well.  I've got a 5800X3D & 9070XT as well.,Positive
Intel,"Fair enough, and yeah sooner the better for all of us",Positive
Intel,It absolutely could be.  Europe has some pretty good consumer law and promising features that could impact your purchase decision are part of this law.  It can fall under misleading advertisement,Neutral
Intel,"It's not freezing, it's just that the GPU usage is practically at 100% all the time, even with V-Sync enabled. With the 25.9 drivers, this doesn't happen, and the clock speed varies normally, increasing and decreasing as needed when V-Sync is enabled. These 25.10 drivers are causing the GPU to consume more energy unnecessarily.",Neutral
Intel,Fingers crossed,Neutral
Intel,"Thanks for attempting to retest.  It's a 7900XTX with an Index connected via DisplayPort. I am on the latest 25.11.1 driver.  I run a monitor at 4k 120Hz 10bpc with HDR Off, which uses DSC, as my main and only display. I tried disabling DSC in the monitor settings which runs at 4k 120Hz 8bpc with HDR Off but I don't think I noticed a change in latency. I thought that DSC on and off on two different devices might contribute to the problem but I'm not sure.   I have also tried running the Index under a RX480 on another PC and I fairly certain the latency looks different under 90Hz and looks similar under 120Hz. Can't play much to test though as an RX480 runs the Index at a very blurry setting. Getting around to doing this test is what took me so long to reply.",Neutral

Intel,Can you tell us what content you have on the secondary panel when it starts misbehaving? Is this behaviour affected if you disable VRR on it too?,Neutral
Intel,"I see. I recall the partial display freeze being related to DWM & multi plane overlay in Windows.

Intel,since last BF6 Update i had zero crashes also on 25.11.1,Negative
Intel,"That's not how it works. Small print won't save you from stuff like this, you think that they can stop releasing this software for 2-3 years because some small print said 'Subject to change'?   European consumer law would absolutely support the consumer in this case. If you promise a feature by a certain date, you will need to deliver it.

Intel,"Works in Windows too. But Windows has way too much overhead for all of the AI garbage, ads and integrated spyware running in the background to still be a usable operating system. Linux is much better.   The drivers install all side-by-side, and all GPUs show up as OpenCL devices. In the software you can then select which one to run on.   FluidX3D can select multiple OpenCL devices at once, each holding only one part of the simulation box in its VRAM. So VRAM of the GPUs is pooled together, with communication happening over PCIe.",Neutral

Intel,"What kind of application are you trying to run on specific GPUs? IIRC Vulkan will let you specify what device to use, even if it's not the GPU whose monitor is showing the application. DirectX I think is controlled by the Graphics settings in Control Panel. I think there's a page somewhere that lets you pick the GPU. That might be a Windows 11 thing though.

Intel,"Technically FluidX3D uses neither SLI nor Crossfire, but cross-vendor multi-GPU instead, for domain decomposition of a Cartesian grid simulation box, to hold larger fluid simulations in the pooled VRAM.   The rendering is done multi-GPU too, as domain decomposition rendering. Each GPU knows only a part of the whole fluid simulation box in VRAM and can't see the others. It only renders its own domain, at 3D offset, to its own frame with accompanying z-buffer, and copies those to CPU over PCIe. The CPU then overlays the frames.",Neutral

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative

Intel,"No, they do not.  The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software.  They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  The main example that seems to suggest otherwise is actually a demonstration of nVidia's forced threading of DX11 games, which can increase performance despite the increased overhead it entails, when the CPU has enough headroom overall (i.e. it doesn't eat into the single-thread performance).",Negative

Maybe they'll improve it by hooking it up to a wider GDDR bus in laptops, similar to how the current PS5 and Xboxes work (IIRC?)",Neutral
Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Neutral
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks. Intel is already moving on it and I think the main thing holding AMD back is that they rely on 3rd parties for memory packaging so the capacity goes to the more lucrative enterprise chips first.",Neutral

Nearly all of the configs that release of 16cu Point APU or 40cu Halo will be an APU slapped in a chassis without an adequate power or memory bandwidth setup for the igpu.     What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra. Its desktop tower chip is behind the entry level mobile OS chip from its competitor. It is a decade behind the desktop chips of its competitor, itis hardly Monster class.",Neutral

AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative

It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs.

Intel,Gotta remember that it's Intel's first line of GPUs. It's going to have issues ofc. Even now they're still improving. And it's only going to keep getting better from here on out,Positive
Intel,"Ok mate, take a first gen product and compare it to a 7th or 8th gen product.  Intel has their issues, anyone buying into them should have known that.",Negative
Intel,"You probably setup VRR wrong, whether that wasnt enabling V-Sync (yes, youre supposed to for VRR), or you tried to use an older HDMI standard, or had a bad driver install and didnt clean install new drivers. Because it absolutely does work as intended with Arc. Arc's VRR is based on VESA's adaptive sync, like Freesync and G-sync compatible also are.  As for A750 performance being worse than a 6800 XT, duh. One card sells for $180, the $450, they are in completely different price and performance tiers. Just like a 7900XTX would make your 6800 XT look like its junk.",Negative
Intel,6800 ultra??? EDIT: so im a dumb it's a nvidia gpu that was made 20 years ago,Neutral

Intel,"I don't recall any real driver issues with my 9700 and 9800 pro. None specific to ATi at least,  rather just the norm for Windows XP era gaming.",Negative
Intel,"My experience with my RX 5700 was also really bad in the first months. Driver timeouts, blackscreens, game crashes. Not even exaggerating. Never thought I'd ever buy an AMD GPU again.

Intel,bruh. This is Intel first generation of discrete GPU. it's damn impressive how fast they are improving. I like AMD too but Intel is doing a pretty good job there,Positive
Intel,I had an arc a750 as a placeholder until I got. A 6950xt and I love it so much. Except amd still hasn't fixed the ghost of tsushima issue other than that it's been phenomenal and I get over 60fps in almost every game at 4k,Positive
Intel,"Well one great thing you have to look forward to is amd is going all in on software. They already said FSR with AI is coming, and I have a feeling a lot more. We should be seeing some pretty cool software features coming out now that they have more employees for software",Positive
Intel,"Actually not. Intel i740, released long time ago was the first discrete GPU from them.",Neutral
Intel,"I'm keeping my eye on Intel gpus, but I certainly won't be a first adopter. Honestly I'll be even more skeptical now with Intel's recent issues with 13/14 gen cpus. All in all though more competition is always good for us consumers. If Intel can be competitive in the budget market it will at least put a fire under amd to lower their prices/make a better valued product.",Negative
Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't. Problems that Nvidia and AMD both solved decades ago that are holding Intel back in 2024.   It's not a mystery how a GPU should be built but that didn't stop Intel from not figuring it out.,Neutral
Intel,"Installs beta software, proceeds to complain about it",Neutral
Intel,Doesn't make it less of a fact that users are experiencing issues and they still paid hard cash for those GPUs.,Negative
Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral
Intel,"This was a graphics card, not a ‘GPU’ in terms that we understand them now, just to bolster the point about how much of a disparity this comparison reveals.",Negative
Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so? They paid full price for a product and it should work as advertised.  With that said, the issues with Arc are widely known and complaining about it after the fact is a bit sillly at this point.",Negative
Intel,If you're playing ghost of tsushima with her enabled it will crash your drivers and you'd have to re-download them via integrated graphics on your cpu,Negative
Intel,"It's not completely irrelevant, as it shows they already had GPU produced before. That GPU had driver issues same as ARC and i believe same will be passed on to BATTLE MAGE.",Neutral
Intel,"Dude, GPU is not same as graphics card. i740 was a GPU in a same way nVidia RTX and AMD RX series are today.  You are mixing them up because todays graphics cards have names same as the GPU used on them.

Intel,Graphics Processing Unit.  Maybe you're confused and thinking of GPGPU?,Neutral
Intel,"her?   i cant say i encountered any problems other than launching with FSR activated crashed the game, but it was optimized enough that you dont need FSR at all (also a ps4 game port which helps)",Neutral
Intel,It's irrelevant because it's from so long ago the people who worked on it are likely no longer working at Intel so there's no organizational knowledge to transfer into designing Arc.,Negative
Intel,Not irrelevant though is that Intel has been making iGPU drivers for the last 20+ years with massive marketshare and still don't get it anywhere NEAR right.,Negative

Intel,Honestly the Nvidia Founders edition in person is the best looking card I've ever seen.,Positive
Intel,"I bought an ARC A770 16GB card for experimentation and my experience seems to have been better than computerbase.  I had no problem using it for 3440x1440 without raytracing. I have to reduce some settings in the heaviest games, but then I can hit 60fps in most games without using upscaling.  It makes me wonder if they have used older drivers, since they don;t even get 60fps rasterized at 1080p in some games.  edit: And I paid much less than the minimum price they are listing, I'd need to check if prices went up - even though computer base suggest that isn't the case. The bigger problem still, but getting better, is that when it doesn't work it's really really terrible.",Positive
Intel,"Well I mean... I guess it depends on what you're wanting to do of course, but even my 12 GB card was struggling to do raytracing a couple years ago, so that claim isn't really far fetched.  My 20 GB card struggles to hit 60 fps with path tracing at 1440p",Negative
Intel,I have a budget build for my vacations off grid with arc a380 heavy oc pushing 2750mhz. Works amazing for 1080p e sport titles and some heavy games low settings around 50-60fps.. off no ray tracing lol.,Positive

Intel,Something about that sexy look of my GTX 1080 fe is gonna make it very hard to replace it.,Positive
Intel,"Yeah, i like the black super series.",Neutral
Intel,"But that's not because your GPU has 20gb vram, that's because AMD doesn't perform well in RT and especially not in PT I promise you a 16gb 4080 will run circles around your 7900xt with PT.  And no I'm not an Nvidia chill I have a 7900xtx myself",Negative
Intel,"people have more information more easily available now, so they know what a good price is for a gpu.   Yeah, you can't a good deal on older cards just because they're old, but you can get more money for your old cards yourself when you wanna upgrade.",Neutral
Intel,I think this needs more mainstream coverage - someone like Wendell@Level1Techs should be interested in this and related phenomena.,Neutral
Intel,"Same experience when using AMDGPU on Linux. Hardware rings will reset after timeout, but you have no guarantee that functionality will return to normal after the reset. The only solution is to reboot the entire system. The video codec rings VCN/VCE/UVD is seriously affected by this. But there seems to be nothing the kernel developers can do about it.

Intel,">listen to them and fix the bugs they report  AMD have been dropping the ball on this for decades, and aren't about to pick it up any time soon. It is genuinely astonishing how poor their bugfixing/driver development approach is.

Intel,"They couldn't care less. We've had issues with AMD drivers in a video production house where we ran Vega GPUs under Linux for DaVinci Resolve editing on the desktops and for rendering on the farm.   Those were the worst years of my life where I had to support the investment that failed as soon as the decision to go with AMD was made.   It costed our company the weight of those cards in solid gold.   After years of battling AMD and failing, I made an ultimatum to our ceo and told him directly that I didn't want to support this anymore and that I'd leave if we didn't switch everything to Nvidia and I actually quit the company over this because the response was that it was impossible. 2 months later they sold all the AMD hardware at a fraction of the original price and managed to take a credit to switch everything to NVIDIA.  Somebody else even made a huge post here and on r/linux, phoronix covered it slightly and AMD went into full panic mode, their developer advocate came here and on AMD forums and in emails and made many grand promises. Here we are almost 10 years later, same issues still exist.  Oh yeah, and BlackMagic (DaVinci Resolve maker) today officially doesn't support their software on any AMD hardware. Thousands of editors, graders and admins go on forums and ask about AMD only to just get directed to Nvidia by the BlackMagic staff.  Great job AMD! You don't deserve a single customer...",Negative
Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative
Intel,"Yo, I saw the title and thought this gotta be Gnif2.",Neutral
Intel,"And I'm over here struggling to keep an Nvidia T4 passthrough to work reliably on Hyper-V to Ubuntu 22.04. :(  Is there a specific software combination that works more reliably than others?   Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.  They working with some kind of magic radiation over there?",Negative
Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.  You're free to guess what vendor om looking at to replace my CPU with. Damn shame really.",Negative
Intel,"Fact: AMD does not give a shit about any of this.   We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line. If all CDNA customers switch to NVIDIA and those PO's dropped in volume, it might make them care a little bit.",Negative

Intel,"I’ve been buying ATI / AMD since the ATI Rage 128, and I think my next GPU will be Nvidia. I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

Intel,"[Wish i could play Hell Divers 2 but when i bought it took 30 seconds to get a driver timeout,](https://i.imgur.com/FqM9MRx.mp4) anyway i decided to not switch NVIDIA cos i also well usually play a lot of World of Warcraft but that game has problems for both AMD in form of freezes and driver timeouts gradually getting worse until you update drivers again, cos shader cache gets reset it stops crashing again for couple of days, then starts crashing more frequently and the frequency varies per user and what they doing as well as if their some sort of memory leak.  Also some other games having driver timeouts to, but i have games that also never timeout.  Speaking of which users started reporting flickering issues in browsers such as chrome, or any chrome based browsers, and their 2 reports of it being fixed after MPO is disabled so i guess MPO issues are back on the menu.

I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.  Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical. I guess that's why nobody is already doing it.",Neutral

Intel,"> Those that are not using VFIO, but the general gamer running Windows with AMD GPUs are all too well aware of how unstable your cards are. This issue is plaguing your entire line, from low end cheaper consumer cards to your top tier AMD Instinct accelerators.  Not over here my guy.

I think they're the defense of a brand like it they are defending their sports club.  We're stuck between the overpriced that just work, and the nightmare the AMD software overall is. I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?  ""I have had X AMD GPUs, with Y experience in computers, never had a problem!""  Or even better, ""That is because you suck at computers"" said by some NPC that doesn't even know what an OS is..  I really hope your letter gets where it needs to go, and please keep up the good job. I still hope AMD steers in the right direction so it can put Nvidia to shame(I want to believe poster here). Not because I have something against this brand or the other, but because we need competitors, or else you'll end up paying 600$ for a nice system, and 6000$ for the GPU.

My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with?    My own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures.",Neutral

Intel,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",Neutral

Intel,"AMD's reputation on VDI seems to be a dumpster fire in homelab scene despite having the first SR-IOV implementation compared to Nvidia and Intel(yes, even Intel is into VDI market!). Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture. Direct passthrough is also possible without too many hacks like AMD do(*cough* vendor-reset *cough*).  People always consider Intel graphics processors as a laughing stock but you gotta respect them for the accessibility of vGPU solution, directly on integrated graphics that everyone gets. They are even trying to enter VDI market with GPU Flex cards based on Alchemist GPUs(SR-IOV was disabled on discrete ARC consumer cards). Hopefully subscription-free model can make Nvidia a run for its money, at least in entry VDI solutions that Nvidia has no interest in.",Negative

Intel,"It's more that I don't want to reward a business for failing me.  If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU  partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.""  ""I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any  reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU,  VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either. So we can't expect  them to do anything and spend the man hours to deliver fixes and work  with the different projects (QEMU, Redhat, Spice, ...etc).""",Negative
Intel,"I'm the same. my issues with Nvidia drivers were so bad it made my gpu and entire windows install functionally bricks. Got rid of my EVGA 760 when the 900 cards and AMD's 300 series came out, jumped to R9 390 and haven't looked back since (R9 390>RX 5700xt>RX 7700xt) The only issue i ever had with AMD was the first few months of the 5700xt and its awful unplayable performance issues in DX9 games, but that was solved within months, and they eventually went on to improve opengl performance on Navi/RDNA as well which was a nice welcome surprise. Ive had a few hiccups that looked like driver issues that turned out to actually be Windows issues, and i always wonder if people are quick to blame AMD for issues because of what they have heard vs actually investigating and finding the real cause of the problem.

I should have just re-pasted my previous GeForce and ride out the pandemic shortage, but I wanted a faster GPU and thought I'd give a Radeon one final chance. There wasn't a 3080 or 3090 available back then, otherwise I would've rather bought one.   While 6800XT has had some okay drivers here and there, the overall experience remains sub-par; the road still is full of unpaved and rough sections.

Intel,"I get that you are being cheeky, but the use-case is very difference and the professional-demands are far far far higher.  When you run several machines off of a single unit, suddenly there's workloads that has to be completely in due time for things to move ahead.  I just want to contextualize the issue you are making (a tadd) fun of.  So in the basic but common example above, you can't really complete your job because the entire main system has to be shut down. That's like stranding 6 people because the bus broke down. And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.  I think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable. There need to be a proper high-grade (and low grade) reliable way to avoid that.  Just sucks it took this long, and so much effort to get AMD to pay notice to the issue at hand here.

For context - Unity VRAM usage is - Unity allocating ""how much it want"" and in case of two different GPU Unity may allocate less or more in DX-API, or DX-API have some internal behavior for Unity case on Nvidia so it allocating less.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

Intel,"Sorry but AMD ""working with"" is a joke. I have been working with companies that have hundreds to thousands of AMD Instinct GPUs.  I have been able to interact directly with the AMD support engineers they provide access to, and the support is severely lacking. These issues here have been reported on for over 5 years now, and what has AMD done for these clients?  Until I made my prior posts here on r/AMD, AMD were not interested or even awake when it came to these issues. I have had direct correspondence with John Bridgman where he confirmed that GPU reset was not even considered in prior generations.  Of what use are these support contracts and the high cost of buying these cards if AMD wont provide the resources to make them function in a reliable manner.  Why did it take some random (me) to have to publicly embarrass the company before we saw any action on bugs reported by their loyal paying enterprise clients?",Negative

We still are lacking working support for the likes of Nutanix and Proxmox (both KVM), where Redhat has some support but there are still unresolved issues there.  Fact of it, the changes AMD is pushing at AWS would upstream to every other KVM install and bring those fixes to mainstream.

I've had exactly one driver-based AMD issue - when I first got my 5700XT on release, there was a weird driver bug that caused the occasional BSOD when viewing video in a browser - this was fixed quickly.  My gaming stability issues were always caused by unstable RAM timings and CPU OC settings - since I upgraded to an AM5 platform with everything stock, I'm solid as a rock. My 7900XTX has been absolutely perfect.  There is an unfair perception in gaming with AMD's drivers where people think they are far worse than they really are - it's a circlejerk at this point.  Your issue is different (and valid), you don't need to conflate the known issues in professional use cases with gaming - it'll just get you pushback because people who use AMD cards for gaming (like me) know the drivers are fine for gaming, which makes you come across as being hyperbolic - and if you're being hyperbolic about the gaming stuff, what else are you being hyperbolic about?

From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.  Does AMD need to improve things?  Of course.

They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.     From global issues with CPU OC was only one i mentioned. When AMD integrated Ryzen Master, old GPU OC presets did reset CPU OC values to default.

Intel,> Enthusiast   > 1440p [...] with FSR Quality [...] 60 FPS  1440p + xxxx Quality upscaling is just another way to say 1080p you cowards. It's 2023 and enthusiast level is 1080p @ 60 FPS.   Looks pretty though with the amount of vegetation.  I'm surprised that they put the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT side by side in a game that has forced ray tracing.

The reliance on upscaling tech instead of properly optimizing the game is becoming a problem. And it seems this game has forced RT which is idiotic. RT destroys performance and should always be an option.",Negative

Intel,so I'm doomed to use FSR even at 1080p ? what a shame pc gaming has become.,Negative
Intel,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?  (I'm not talking about this game in particular, just in general, it was same outrage w/ AW2 and that turned out better than expected)",Neutral
Intel,I hope they will bundle this game with CPUs/GPUs,Positive

Intel,"Another garbage with forced upscaling at baseline. When upscaling winded up - everyone was ""Hell yeah, high refresh rate AAA gaming""  Fast forward to today: ""FSR performance just to hit 1080p 60fps - yay..""   I fucking knew it.. it was so obvious upscaling will turn into this and replace game optimizations. Why optimizing shit, when you can tell people to turn on fucking FSR / DLSS / XeSS performance??   What a fucking shitshow... And few weeks back when I said I'm not gonna buy AMD GPU again because upscaling is getting mandatory and DLSS is just objectively superior - I was laughed in the face. Every major AAA game onwards will be shoving up upscaling as base line performance - so your typical 60fps marks (and 30fps - yes apparently that is still a thing on PC in 2023).

Also, displaying system requirements with upscaling is a bad joke. This is basically saying you’re not getting native 1080p 60fps without a 6800xt or 3080.

Intel,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",Neutral

Now, it's being proven right in our faces that companies are no longer making 100% they're making 45% done games, and then they rely on upscaling and fake frames to do the rest.   Why have a fully optimized game that runs well natively when you can just lower the resolution by 3x then have frame generation help?   Full force ahead to frame generation= Every game will be optimized so badly that you're forced to upscale",Negative
Intel,"It’s literally right there in the hardware specs. 1080p fsr2 quality is 720p input resolution, so at native the game runs at 720p low on a 1070 or 5700.  It is the inverse of what reviewers have been doing with their benchmarks - if you are a fan who really has a stick up their ass about native res, just do the math yourself. They’ve given you all the pieces you need to calculate it out yourself, but that’s not how the game is supposed to be run so they aren’t going to put native res in the official marketing material.  Games are optimized around upscaling now and it is unhelpful and misleading to pretend otherwise. Rendering 4x as many pixels is *obviously* going to throw things off with more intensive effects, and lead to a generally unplayable experience.",Neutral

Intel,"people also forget both AMD and nvidia didn't really offer a generation leap in GPU performance this gen, sure it's popular to call games ""unoptimized"" (I know many AAA releases are, not denying that) but the issue compounds with the fact that game devs couldn't predict a GPU generation to be this bad caused by inflated crypro-boom margins a generation prior",Negative
Intel,"As with almost every game release recently, expect the game to perform a bit better than the requirements.    Sometimes the hardware can achieve 60 FPS most of the time but drops below that in other times, so the devs just say it's guaranteed 30 FPS and call it a day. If you look at the 5700 vs 6700XT, the gap is almost 50% in most titles, this means that if the numbers for the 5700 were accurate then the 6700XT will be getting around 45 FPS at 1080p low (unless the game utilizes special hardware only available on the 6700XT) but the game targets 60 FPS at 1080p high on the 6700XT which leads me to believe the 5700 is gonna perform much better which should leave room for turning off upscaling.",Positive

Intel,"> what a shame pc gaming has become  I mean, PC gaming is in the best state ever. So many amazing games that run so well. Just don't buy all these shitty games, not like there is a shortage.  Tbh this game looks like standard movie cash grab shite anyway. Solid 4/10 game I bet.",Negative
Intel,Which means if all games will require upscaling it will force AMD to improve there's. I'm on board with you though will see way less optimization going forward which is not what we want.,Negative

Intel,"Update: I must've read that wrongly somewhere! Apparently, it uses their own Snowdrop Engine 😳  Well AC: Mirage is nowhere near a next-gen game. Avatars of Pandora, on the other hand, uses Unreal Engine 5 with hardware ray tracing. So it's only natural it needs more horse power. But it'll look 10x better than AC: Mirage. So there's that 😉",Neutral
Intel,Timed epic exclusivity? Aww man.,Negative
Intel,Was guaranteed to happen when up scaling was announced... It's an excuse for less optimisation or to push fidelity more.  I saw a video of this avatar game it got an insane amount of plants visible at all times.,Negative
Intel,You... are.. joking... right..?,Neutral
Intel,Because it’s not coming to steam. It’ll be an epic games exclusive so everyone will pass on it until it hits steam in 18 months. At which point no one will buy an 18 month old game for full price and will wait for a 50% off sale at the minimum.,Negative

Intel,"Really comes up to how far the rt and lumen stuff can be pushed, if it goes to cyberpunk psycho rt levels? At release it needed a 3080 and 3090 with dlss.   So it could need top end gpu of this gen if its a similar case",Neutral
Intel,yup that is why I will play 1440 UW native with a 7900XTX.,Neutral
Intel,I guess they are confused with dlss.  Dlss 2= up scaling Dlss3 = frame gen  So they thought its for fsr3 too. ( as in fsr2 up scaling and 3 frame gen)   But fsr3 can do frame gen or not.  Fsr3 is up scaling and frame gen.,Neutral
Intel,"Likely mid range gpu and a suit yells in the background ""30 fps with up scaling is fine""",Neutral
Intel,"Likely the same, they didn't want to make the graph even more annoying, hence why fsr3 and rt and xess are mentioned top right.

Intel,"Especially recommending FSR.  DLSS at 1080p? Sure why not?   FSR at 1080p? Disgusting, absolutely horrific.  Anyone who downvotes this is a fanboy, end of story. Nvidia's DLSS simply is better at reconstructing an image. At lower resolutions that is SIGNIFICANTLY more important.",Negative
Intel,Or be happy your shitty video card is still supported.,Neutral
Intel,and we still get shat on for saying they are or admitting its a bad thing. corpo fanbois are so cringe,Negative
Intel,Even 4090 users use DLSS because it fixes TAA problems. And has a sharpening slider for easy sharpening adjustment.,Positive
Intel,When did I ever complain about how expensive gpus are. I've always been in the category that they are luxury item and vendor can charge whatever they want for em. So you aint never hear me complain about gpu prices.,Negative
Intel,I can't market a game for running with 120fps 4k with raytracing on on a RTX 4060.  But I can market 400 completely identical missions that take up 150 hours of your lifespan and empty out your soul.,Negative
Intel,Yea I know nothing about optimizations and if it could or couldn't fix this or that. I just want them to tell me exactly what I need to run the game at X resolution a Y preset with 60 fps. If that calls for a 14900k and a 4090 then just say so.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, I think we're really beginning to see a trend here with abusing upscaling for free mileage.  Not that upscaling isn't great but...  Apart from RT, on medium settings, I can't really see    massive improvements on visual quality that would warrant such a massive increase on requirements.  UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  We'll probably see this continuing to be a trend for a while, and then as tech novelty wears out, some devs will come out with more optimized and scalable titles.  With hardware prices being as they are, and with 60fps now being highly requested in consoles as well, it's pretty much a given.",Negative
Intel,"People accepted upscaling with open arms, so now devs know they can rely on people using it. Thus they don't have to care about optimizing for native res anymore. Oh you have a 4k card? Okay well we'll make sure it can run the game at 1080p so you can upscale it.",Neutral
Intel,"No average consumer wanted to come to this point. The market leader started pushing upscaling instead of just making stronger GPU’s and there’s nothing AMD can do to win them, only join them.",Negative
Intel,Turns out TAA is worse than AI TAA with AI upscaling.   Of course devs are gonna use it to cover their own asses. And they get perf boost!  Let's face it. The FUTURE is AI everything. Nobody is gonna talk shit about frame generation and upscaling when it looks perfect each frame.,Negative
Intel,But it does in many ways.,Neutral
Intel,"I don't know who those people are. I play all my games on native, whether I'm using an amd or nvidia card.",Neutral

Intel,"You're even seeing this on console, where Spiderman 2 now has RT reflections in every mode. Even Unreal 5's Lumen renderer is a software raytracer that can be hardware accelerated.

Intel,"I thought that was on Linux, though I might be wrong",Neutral
Intel,1070 doesn't have hardware RT though.,Neutral
Intel,According to the technical director there's no non-raytracing mode. I'm assuming that means software ray tracing for the minimum spec.  Source: Skill Up video - https://youtu.be/v91y87R5iDk?t=332 (5m32s),Neutral

Intel,Damn my brain must have been on auto pilot. I'm so used to 2160p + FSR quality neatly equalling 1440p.,Negative

Intel,">I guess the wonders of everyone jumping on the Swiss knife engine approach ue rather than doing their own engines made for their games.  Facepalm...  Avatar Frontiers of Pandora very literally uses a custom engine, not Unreal Engine.",Neutral
Intel,Yep. This company learned something from all the failure game launches that happened this year. The game companies can't just implement one gpu company's tech and not the others bc then it'll only work on the one gpu that you implemented the tech for and it won't work on the other gpus from other companies. Meaning for example if a game company only implemented fsr it's only going to work on amd gpus and not on Nvidia and Intel gpus and vise versa is true too for both Nvidia and Intel gpus for dlss and xess.,Negative
Intel,Avatar is RT only. There is no non RT mode.,Neutral
Intel,This is mad with snowdrop engine. It's Ubisoft they don't use unreal...,Negative
Intel,"Yep, I missed that. Good call! Makes sense why the specs are a bit higher then but if it is forced on, that's going to be rough on any one with a more mid tier card.",Neutral
Intel,">  Consoles use mostly FSR balanced  heck sometimes they use performance or less, heck a lot of the time even. Especially with RT or performance modes",Neutral
Intel,They have really long way to go. Take for example Lords of the Fallen - UE5's TSR is better than FSR. Take Alan Wake 2 and you get ton of shimmering on the edges. It's also not like nvidia not improving - so while AMD makes a step forward so will do nvidia..   There's also question how much they improve without dedicated accelerators that both Intel and nvidia is using. Intel jumped late to the party and they're already ahead - which just shows how much AMD cares. It's rally embarrassing considering both XBOX and PlayStation are also relying on FSR - ant that's bigger market than what nvidia has.,Neutral
Intel,I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?  I mean the facts are the facts. I need to play on lower settings till we get a 5070 or 8800xt.,Neutral
Intel,"It uses their own in-house engine, Snowdrop. The last game this developer did was The Division II which was excellent.",Neutral
Intel,"Took a look at some gameplay on YouTube, and it does look nice enough, though water looked like ass, and as mentioned already, it's an in-house engine (which is nice to see TBH).",Positive
Intel,You will never see a high production game from Ubisoft ever on the Steam store ever again at initial launch.  They are the anti-christ of the gaming industry seriously.,Negative
Intel,Consoles are the baseline in most multiplat games and they've been using upscaling since forever. The real reason is just that we don't have GPUs anymore that are 10x faster than consoles like last gen. You can't bruteforce high resolutions in games that run at like 720p on consoles with GPUs that are only 2-3x faster.  If upscaling didn't exist on PC the minimum here would just be 720p at the minimum and 1080p-1440p at the max.,Negative
Intel,Next-gen doesn't mean that current gen can run it well. It means it's so far ahead that most curren-gen hardware can't run it properly + top-end hardware can only barely run it well.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly. These paid exclusive games launches only make me care less whenever they actually release.  It's not just Epic, Meta has done it with several games (Moss Book 2) and when a proper looking pcvr port comes a year later it sells bad because people forgot about it.",Negative
Intel,"Is that with significant RT? I assumed it was ""normal"" ultra settings.  Still I can play Far Cry 6 and RE4 with AMD sponsored RT at 4k native with 100fps. This game will have to look amazing to justify what... a quarter of that performance?",Positive
Intel,"You are correct. I overlooked the part where, under Ultra settings, it said that was with FSR2. Now it doesn't seem as bad. I mean, it's still not good because it's rendering somewhere between 1080p and 1440p, but at least it's not 30 fps without Frame Gen/60 fps with it like I thought.",Neutral
Intel,"It might be, AFAIK neither Nvidia nor AMD still support their implementation of it in their drivers.  But I've tried it on a few games and it is pretty cool to me, much stronger than almost any modern 3D movie (IMO why 3D has gone into hibernation), and I gather that Cameron designed the franchise around 3D.  Plus the Avatar 1 game was in 3D.  FWIW.",Positive
Intel,This is what I am thinking too.,Neutral
Intel,"You say that, but they specifically mentioned FSR3, and just DLSS, so i have a feeling DLSS3 will have to go via a mod again.",Neutral
Intel,"i have a believe that even 4C8T will survive for the decade, like the case of that 4790K. But turns out these newer UE5 games are wrecking even newish CPU like the 3600. i mean cmon it's still a 4 years CPU old which i think it's not old yet",Neutral
Intel,Let's hope so. 30fps is far from recommended for FSR 3,Positive
Intel,Yeah I heard it works with that hoping it works with fsr3 now,Positive
Intel,"I've noticed that for some reason newer games look blurry at 1080 even without any kind of upscaling and I'm not sure why, older game look much sharper at 1080p",Negative
Intel,"Just lazy optimisation, that’s pretty much a PS5 equivalent GPU and you can be damn sure that the console version won’t be 1080P 30fps with FSR",Negative
Intel,"No it says 5700. NOT 5700XT, and yes there is a difference. Quite literally the difference between a 1070 and 1080ti. Or a 2070 and 2080.",Neutral
Intel,no no my 7 year old card needs to be able to play at high settings. so does my low end card from today. gotta be high or its just bad,Negative
Intel,Crazy expectation? A game released in 2023 should be able to run at 1080p low 30fps on a low end card like rx6500xt (lowest end modern card you can buy now).  Optimization matters.,Neutral
Intel,"Yup, these cards came out around the time of ps4 I think..that's a long time ago in the graphical quality of games we are seeing.  People should be happy to a point that those cards can even run some of these games if upscaling helps them run that's a bonus as it means they don't need to upgrade if those graphics settings are acceptable to them.",Positive
Intel,"I have a 5700 and it does better at 1080p on these games than what is normally posted. Now it does need quality fsr but its not the worst thing, anything lower than quality is. Bottom line is these are not 100% correct and never have been.  I have zero interest in this game but the specs seem fine even though I wish upscaling wasn't what was relied on for optimization.",Negative
Intel,"well you dont know what they mean by 30 fps. It could be de 1% lows or the average, we dont know. The easy assumption is that it will be 30 fps average. but that's crazy that a game at 1080p low cant be run by a 5700. It better be a new Crysis.  edit: apparently it uses raytracing only for lighting which would explain the hows and why it crushes the framerate so bad especially on a gpu that doesnt have hardware raytracing like the 5700.",Negative
Intel,"Or in the case of games like Alan Wake 2, you will get unplayable fps if you try to running it at 4k native max settings. Even with a 4090, you will get a glorious 20fps.",Negative
Intel,Assassins creed origins and odyssey side quests/collectibles oh my god,Neutral
Intel,Yeah it doesn't give us a actual gauge to understand what we need for set native parameters. I mentioned optimization out of concern that they rely too much on upscaling and it seems like it's the lazy way out of something. It's unrealistic that a usable gaming experience be in a top tier hardware setup that costs $2k+ and top tier hardware of just the last generation are just barely cutting it anymore.,Negative
Intel,I appreciate your insights and opinions. Thank you.,Positive
Intel,">UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  Because they market how ""good"" it looks, not how ""well"" it runs. There's a big influence from marketing perspective to place high focus on ""eye candy"", it's what sells.

Intel,that's stoopid but it's somewhat more understandable. Why a 5700 would struggle so much since it doesnt have hardware raytracing,Neutral
Intel,Yep it's like a 10/15% performance uplift in some games but I'd guess they would prefer to keep the requirements sheets somewhat simple.,Neutral

Intel,Avatars uses a Lumen like software RT solution.,Neutral
Intel,"yeah they never finished the sentence for some reason.

Intel,"The AA side of things might be better, but I swear no matter the resolution textures become a blurry mess even with Quality mode etc, and it irks me that most people don't seem to notice that.",Negative
Intel,Some people seem to have very low sensitivity to added blur. See also *depth of field blur* and *motion blur* being on by default in every game.

Intel,"The 5700 and 5700xt is more like a 1070 and 1070ti situation. It's not that big a gap, and you can close it even tighter because the majority of RX 5700 cards can be flashed to a 5700xt bios tightening the gap farther.",Negative
Intel,"The 1070 was released in 2016. Its already the end of 2023. That card belong to ps4 era. Wake up.   People in this sub are delusional, really.",Negative
Intel,Those are some dumbass expectations. Maybe you should correct them instead of blaming the developers for it.,Neutral
Intel,"The 6500XT offers $200 2016 performance. In fact its often worse because of how gimped it is interface wise. Its one of the worst products released in recent years.  Its not the game developers fault AMD pretty much rebadged the RX 480 4 times and they can't be expected to sink their optimization to that level.  RX 480, RX580, RX 5500XT and RX6500XT are virtualy the same product performance wise. RX 5500XT is the most consistent one of the lot offering a somewhat more modern arhitecture in its 8GB variant. The 6500XT on the other hand while on a newer arhitecture is an unmitigated disaster that is on par at best and sinks even below the RX580 when memory, bus and PCIE interface constrained.  The console baseline is around 6700XT/2070 Super/3060ti level. People better get used to that as its gonna become or already has become the norm for 1080p high settings gaming. The 5700 is upwards of 30% slower by default while also having less hardware features. Its gonna become the minimum norm going forward alongside the 2060's of your time.",Negative
Intel,"the 1070 was 2016, the 5700 was 2019. While both not new its not 10 years old like the PS4 (2013)",Neutral
Intel,This is literally only true if you use path tracing. I think you're trying to insinuate the game is unoptimized when it just scales really high with visual features if your hardware supports it. It straight up runs great for the visual features it uses.,Neutral
Intel,"That was exclusive to console releases, no? And never to the point of replacing AA sharpening and rendering the game from 720p…",Negative
Intel,No I havent. AMD is bigger than Epic.,Neutral
Intel,"Right, you'll have different complaints but complaints none the less even though the new Ultra might still look slightly better prior gen games and offer high FPS but people would complain that the graphics are not advancing fast enough, they look the same etc etc.  Yah those days are likely gone but it's hard to say if it's because the game is unoptimized or if the dev is really pushing the limits of what they can do graphically and use upscaling as a buffer because what they have in mind, or what they intend to show is too taxing for current hardware. We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it. This is why I've never in my life ever pre-ordered a game. I still don't understand why people do it (esp now that games are digital) but lot of people do. Then again I've never really paid for a ""skin"" or some other visual add-on so maybe that's what attracts people.  I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets. The presets are all relative anyways. There's no universal settings that define what each preset represents.  I just don't get the outrage on these minimum spec sheets compared to what the game is showing graphically. At least wait until it releases and we have some hard data.",Negative
Intel,"I'm also a dev dood sometimes it's literally a ""foutage de geugle"" I had a friend who talk about how shit devs in EA (the people who's making the engine) code and doesn't optimise",Negative
Intel,"The commenter I replied to said there wasn't a big generational improvement for GPUs, while I said there was. But I agree that 4080 is expensive for what it offers.",Neutral
Intel,It was the same price as a 3090 at launch and offers 90% more performance.  It was definitely a generational leap.,Positive
Intel,It's software ray tracing which isn't accelerated by hardware.,Neutral
Intel,and i guess it can be hard to tell if ram is dual or single rank with just two sticks of it too.,Neutral
Intel,>might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.  I was pointing out that 1070 doesn't have hardware RT either.,Negative
Intel,So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?,Negative
Intel,"Why not make it toggleable though, you can choose other graphics settings so it makes no sense. Most people don't play games with RT enabled",Negative
Intel,Still kinda weird that they put the RX 5700/A750 on the same ballpark as the 1070... Being that the newer GPUs actually perform closer to a 1080(Ti).,Neutral
Intel,Sounds like improperly configured negative LOD bias. If you have Nvidia you can fix it with nvinspector. On AMD there's nothing you can do IIRC if Devs mess it up.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly what I'm telling them all the time, that I can see difference in textures, in hair, fences, powerlines etc. And every time I get downvoted by the army of ""but it looks better then native"". I feel like majority of that sub needs to go get a prescription for new glasses",Negative
Intel,"So if you stopped measuring who's bigger, why do you think I have no access to DLSS? Tested on rig with 4080 on a C2 42"" screen. Once you stop thinking with the tip of your head where probably Nvidia's logo is tattooed or maybe Jensen's face, who knows, you could come to realization that one person have access to more hardware then only his personal rig.  Do I say that FSR is better then DLSS? No! Both of them have their issues, but none of them is better then native. Keep on fanboying mate, instead of providing normal convoy as grownups",Neutral
Intel,I don't think YOU understand what you're talking about.  Did you seriously expect Snowdrop to be something used in like one game and then discarded completely?,Negative
Intel,"The thing is: creating good looking lightning with RT is much easier than with prebaked illumination. I can fully understand, why developers of new games are using RT as the basis of their game.",Positive
Intel,Minimum requirements go up as games get/look better. They probably made this game with the series s as the minimum. Low settings probably looks better than high in most games.   Rt for the last few years has been added on top of already complete games. Now games are being made with rt as the standard and they would have to manually do a ton of extra work to support 7+ year old hardware. It's the same as having to drop support for last gen consoles to be able to deliver a better game.,Neutral
Intel,"And still - superior upscaling makes it worth paying extra, RT on higher end is worth paying extra. AMD even this gen doesn't undercut price by enough, especially in EU where power efficiency also play a role. For example, assuming I'm gonna use GPU for 2 gens, then I save ~90-100€ with my usage just on electricity alone. I know it's over period of 4 years, but still it's price difference that will recoup over time, even if I have to pay extra upfront. AMD is simply no longer a value proposition.",Neutral
Intel,"They did not, lol - that fixes completely different thing, not the FSR caused shimmering edges.",Negative
Intel,Both excellent 👌 Down the Rabbit Hole was another solid one.,Positive
Intel,"RE4 came out this year.  Anyway the difference between us is I don't think any lighting effect is worth a $1,000 GPU using 1080p resolution and 60fps, but I know many disagree. That's life.",Neutral
Intel,"3600 and the 3300x was built with the TSMC 7nm if i recall, that was 2018 cutting edge tech. and somehow in gaming it's already obsolete. i was planning to replace mine with 5700x  but i cancel it because it's still very much capable for what i do now. but now after UE5 i think i'll reconsider it again, maybe even as far as 5800X3D",Neutral
Intel,It is crazy that I see everyone saying that modern games look blurry. I've known for years taa does this but it seems like I see more people than ever dissatisfied by it.,Negative
Intel,I have to turn it off in borderlands 3. Ugh.,Neutral
Intel,r/FuckTAA,Neutral
Intel,"My friend nicknamed it after his eyesight. When he wears glasses he has 20/20, but when he doesn’t he says that he sees the image about the same as without glasses",Neutral
Intel,"Out of curiosity what resolution do you usually game at and at what distance? I find taa usually looks pretty good in modern games, but I'm also playing on a TV (48 inches but I'm not at monitor distance anymore). When I played on my 1920x1200 monitor I HATED TAA, well, not as much as fxaa, but moreso than smaa, and I missed msaa or SGSSAA with a passion. Now on the TV at 4k (lol, usually not on a 6700xt), 1440p, or even 1080p I find TAA can do a pretty decent job paired with varying levels of the Radeon sharpness adjustment in the adrenaline drivers. But again, probably due to viewing distance.  Looks leagues better than FXAA and I prefer it to SMAA now. But again, I'm sitting further away and tweaking sharpening to my liking. FSR2 seems to be a wash most of the time but the performance gain is worth it.",Positive
Intel,You dumbass do understand that even the console version of the recent games are total mess? Alan wake 2 have to run on reduced settings to even reach 30fps on xbox/PS. Callisto protocol used to have frametime issue on consoles. Console ports still targets 30fps on quality settings with upscaling while target should be 60fps with 120fps for performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, seems you are correct, it was the ps4 pro that came out in 2016, still, I wouldn't expect that to be capable of running some of the games we are seeing now without some serious compromises.",Neutral
Intel,I never said that Alan Wake 2 is unoptimised. I just said that even a 4090 can’t max out the game at native 4K resolution.,Negative
Intel,epic is tencent...,Neutral
Intel,"In terms of absolute numbers sure, 3090 always had a stupid price tho for being 10% faster than a 3080.   In terms of performance per dollar the 4090 even at 2x 3080 performance was worse value since you pay 1600 not 1400.",Negative
Intel,"Yes, you either have to get the spec sheet of the RAM modules (That even then it may not specify if it's a single/dual rank module) or test it in a system and use HWinfo/CPU-Z. Not as straightforward as dual channel that's mostly just using two identical modules.",Neutral
Intel,You don't need RT hardware to do software RT. That's what I'm saying.,Neutral
Intel,"For this particular game, there is a software fallback. Also, even if we did get a game that mandated hardware support for RT they'd still likely build it with console in mind so even RDNA2 GPUs shouldn't have issues",Neutral
Intel,"The first RT/DLSS capable cards are 5 years old now, way older than the current consoles. You are definitely not being left behind if you're only outdated by 1 gen lol",Neutral
Intel,I mean the last non ray tracing cards were released 4 years ago (1650/60 and 5000s from AMD),Neutral
Intel,Games running poorly on computers weaker than current gen consoles isn't exactly anything new.,Neutral
Intel,"No, you have multiple generations of games from prior to raytracing to enjoy.  Games shouldn't be held back forever just because someone wants to game on a GeForce2 MX400.",Negative
Intel,You are stuck playing older games. Unless someone can find a way to disable it with a mod.,Neutral
Intel,> So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?  A gen old is second gen RT e.g. rtx 3000.  We're halfway through the third RT/matrix generation right now.,Negative
Intel,Yes hah,Neutral
Intel,"The 3090 or 6950xt will very likely run this game extremely well, they're a gen old.",Positive
Intel,"For the AMD GPU, it's probably because minimum will be the max it will support. Medium probably requires Hardware RT.  For Intel, I don’t know. Perhaps it signal not so great optimization for Intel GPUs...",Neutral
Intel,DLSS is very strong in thin lines like fences & hair. Much better than most TAA solutions. Not sure about FSR in general.  An example: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6erA6BVkAAuf_M?format=jpg&name=large  Only DLSS resolves the lines properly.,Positive
Intel,"I mean, it's not that black and white. Quality upscaling to 1080 will obviously be more noticeable than 4k. Maybe you *can* tell the difference between 4k native and dlss quality, but people aren't gonna believe you unless you prove it with some kind of blind test, but I doubt you'd be willing to go out of your way to do that.  Even if you could, the benefits of better aa might outweight some negligible drop in textures or whatever it is upscaling reduces. Though that's irrelevant when DLAA or NAA are options too, I guess.",Neutral
Intel,"Test, which one looks better, explain.  https://imgsli.com/MjE3MzEy",Neutral
Intel,Oh man the hair... its so crazy how much upscaling kills the hair..,Negative
Intel,i mean they already arent the smartest bulbs considering they went team green.,Neutral
Intel,Reading comrehension dude.,Neutral
Intel,"I do, but thanks for your interest.",Positive
Intel,That will depend on the user. Power is cheap here in canada so none of thar factors into my buying decisions. And rt will depends on the games you play also not everyone plays tripple a games.,Neutral
Intel,"You need to get 23.20.17.05.  Fixed Issues Intermittent flicker may be observed on some textures while playing Alan Wake 2.  Fixed for most people, also has a nice performance boost of about 10fps from what I'm seeing.  That being said I always prefer native resolution unless absolutely necessary. So far only had to use it in Martha is Dead.",Positive
Intel,Nice. It’s on the list. Thanks man,Positive
Intel,Yes.... 7nm was but 4 cores the actual important thing was obsolete like 10 or 12 years ago.,Neutral
Intel,Probably because TAA is (unfortunately) more prevalent than it ever was.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, most people are FINE with it. Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  The thing is, you have sharpening filters today. You can adjust the sharpening for TAA. You can make it look oversharpened if you want. There's driver level sharpening for both AMD and NVIDIA. Both also have software sharpening filters.  And DLSS and FSR bot have sharpening sliders.  There's 3 ways to adjust how blurry and how sharp the game looks for everyone. It's a non issue and even Digital Foundry acknowledges the benefits of TAA for game devs vs things like the blur. At the end of the day, these games are looking great...in this era, with exceptions. Not all games are blur. The whole blur thing was like in the past 4 years since upscalers started and TAA became the norm. But with all the sharpening options, and with devs actually used to making TAA not so soft looking, things are definitely getting a lot better for TAA.",Neutral
Intel,Oh my bad if I read that wrong,Negative
Intel,And I'm saying 1070 doesn't have hardware RT so it's just as gimped as AMD cards when doing RT.,Negative
Intel,Still pretty annoying nonetheless. Until it's stable no way should it be forced upon a game when someone's willing to run it normally at native.,Negative
Intel,"and the 2080ti is still winning, best purchase in gpu i made in a long time.",Positive
Intel,imagine being mad that 4 year old cards arent high end,Neutral
Intel,I'm on a 6700XT. 🙇. I just feel very shocked that I would probably need a gpu upgrade soon. With the demands of new games. Also 1440p ruined me.,Positive
Intel,"Technically makes sense, but they can just make RT something you can toggle between Software/Hardware and they also could just add the Vega 56 in the requirement sheet being that was AMD's competitor to the 1070 or they could've added the GTX 1080(Ti)/RTX 2060(Super) into the sheet.  On Intel's side they only have the A580 as the closest GPU to a 1070, even when it's too similar to the A750 performance wise :/",Neutral
Intel,"It is that black and white for me. I can immediately see the added image softness from upscaling, and it's especially prevalent with DLSS 2.5+ unless you enable a sharpening filter. DLAA also has weird issues like blurring textures (almost like it reverts to initial mipmap) while moving, usually at mid-distance from camera. It's too distracting and I have to go back to regular TAA. Immediately goes away.  1440p to 2160p is better than 720p to 1080p, but it's still noticeable. Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible? No. Actually changing monitor resolution outside of native and having all UI elements scaled looks terrible. That was what we used to do and upscaling is much better than that alternative. LCD panels need to stay at native signal resolution and GPU should scale render resolutions.",Negative
Intel,"And you look at static image all the time while gaming? It's different story when movement is involved, that's where you find all the artefacts you get. Static image doesn't tell a thing when it comes to gaming",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, and that's driving me crazy. I really couldn't stand it in Cyberpunk (in other titles it's either hit or miss), that I play it in native 4k instead.",Negative
Intel,"Wouldn't phrase it like that tough. I had that choice too in January, and actually by going 4070Ti instead of 7900XT I would be able to play Cyberpunk in higher fidelity and better frames then on mine, because AMD cooked FSR3.0 almost a year in the oven, and God knows how long it will take for CDPR to add it to the game, if ever considering that active development on game is ended and they are on bug fixing sprint right now. Also AMD needs to fix FSR in general, because how it works with smaller details like hair and fences is awful. But don't get me wrong, I love my card, just feel I git sold on features that would come handy right kow instead of when I don't need them anymore",Neutral
Intel,"Sorry mate, guess I need to read comments early morning instead of late night, just saw that last bit. My apologies. I'm just tired of upscalare wars whatever sub I go, and green team fanboys screaming that ""FSR is shit, DLSS is better then native"" and then throwing around static images for comparison",Negative
Intel,"It's for textures, not object edges from FSR use, lol. Two completely different things",Neutral
Intel,"people echoing the same shit like ""ooh 4C is obsolete, you need to upgrade that geriatric cpu"". 4C is still solid for gaming (ofc no UE5) and literally anything beside doing compute intensive professional workloads.",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening makes the image less blurry, but it doesn't recover the texture detail lost from TAA blur.",Negative
Intel,"""Even Nvidia foundry""   \---   they are like chief proponents of blur-tech and they don't care about how sharp and easy-to-see the image is. TAA flattens the image so you can't see which objects are far and which are near, you have to strain your eyes and mind to determine that which is unbearable to many. Just give us option to disable it even if it breaks some effects (which is just lazy thing to do on the side of devs)",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening fixes blur, not clearity. That is TAA destroys+add significant ghosting no matter the implementation.      Sharpening looks was worse than the normal cleairy of games, it's not the same thing at all.      >Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  We are mad because it being forced 1 and 2 it's being used to hide lazy effects that break without temporal frame smearing. People are now punished for turning off forced frame smearing.",Negative
Intel,And I'm saying that maybe the GTX 1070 is better at even software RT compared to AMD cards with no RT hardware. GTX 10 series card did get RTX support through CUDA even though they were horribly bad at it. Older AMD cards with no RT hardware didn't get any support like that from AMD.,Neutral
Intel,"You're not forced to use upscaling though. Unless you replied to the wrong person this is about ray tracing, which can be run at native just fine. If your GPU can't handle RT at native res, then just use upscaling.",Neutral
Intel,The minimum requirements for this game includes de 1070: a 7-year-old gpu from 2016.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm not really shocked, and was out there telling people not to buy those cards on day 1 in large part because of their deficiencies in RT performance and complete lack of matrix accelerators (which Nvidia and Intel have both made a large part of their architecture and got shockingly good results with - DLSS and matrix-XeSS are twice as good as FSR)",Negative
Intel,5700 was probably the lowest AMD card they had to test with.,Neutral
Intel,"It also looks better in gameplay, less ghosting, less shimmering, less aliasing.   So which one looks better? You clearly see the difference in textures/fences/powerline, right?  I even made it easier for you, both images are 1080p output.",Positive
Intel,I personally didn't try DLSS even once but FSR 2.0 does have shimmering I notice to various degrees. It was very noticable on fur in Ratchet & Clank cutscenes for example. Overall I am just happy my 5700xt could still keep up with 1440p.,Positive
Intel,Hmm yeah whatever you want to believe and let's you sleep.  Have a nice day.,Positive
Intel,AMD CAS is aimed to restore detail,Neutral
Intel,"They aren’t chief proponents of anything, TAAU has been popular for well over a decade at this point and it’s the default approach for consoles (checkerboarding has moire and aliasing issues) and digital foundry simply recognizes this is the reality of how the console world has settled on doing graphics.",Neutral
Intel,The problem with Nvidia is they are massively overpriced. One 4080 would probably cost the same as my whole build or more.,Negative
Intel,"Yes I see which one looks better, and as I said before it's a static image. While I didn't use upscaling in this same exact example, I can go by my own experience and tell that it doesn't look better then native let's say in same Cyberpunk or any other game. And I will beleive my own eyes on my own screen then static images tossed around. TBH, in my opinion it all depends on screen and screen size too, as to me that difference between upscaled and native was less noticible on my old 27"" 1440p screen then it is now on 42"" 4k. DLAA tough, that's another story",Neutral
Intel,"I tried both, and neither of them are better then native as people tend to claim. In my testing FSR have big problem with smaller details like hair, fur, fences, powerlines and as you mentioned, you get severe shimmering effect. I really hope AMD will keep on working on it, an try to get away from that. But DLSS also adds shimmer, it's just less visible then in FSR (atleast in my testing on Cyberpunk pre 2.0), and whatever upscaling method I've used I also could see that image is upscaled (lower res textures here and there etc.). I like idea being upscaling tech, it helps prolong life of GPUs, and for more powerful GPUs to run higher settings with more fidelity, but there's still work to do on them as they aren't perfect yet.",Negative
Intel,Yeah but a 3060ti didn't,Neutral
Intel,"In Cyberpunk you are not comparing upscaling vs no upscaling at the same settings though. You are comparing low RT native vs path traced upscaling and at 4K, the decission there is absolutely clear. On my 4k OLED screen, upscaled PT is so clearly the way to go, there is no competition.",Neutral
Intel,"The gameplay looks exactly like the image + your typical TAA/DLSS smearing. And as I said, in my example DLSS also looks better in gameplay, because as you see... native has a ton of aliasing which is super noticeable while playing (shimmering). There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling. Talking about native is nonesense, just image quality counts and thats were DLSS or even FSR 2 (some games) gets better and better. There is a reason why consoles use it... it looks better than without it.",Positive
Intel,Confirmed Can it run CP2077 4k is the new Can it run Crysis,Neutral
Intel,It'll be crazy seeing this chart in 5-10 years with new gpu's pushing 60-120 fps with no problem.,Positive
Intel,In 1440p with 7900 xtx with fsr 2.1 quality it doesn’t even get 30fps,Negative
Intel,"Makes sense. Is almost full path tracing, it’s insane it’s even running.",Positive
Intel,good. this is how gaming should be. something to go back to before the next crysis shows its teeth,Positive
Intel,3080 falling behind a 3060? what is this data?,Neutral
Intel,wake me up when we have a card that can run this at 40 without needing its own psu.,Neutral
Intel,5090 here I come!,Neutral
Intel,"Playing the game maxed out with path tracing, FG, RR and DLSS set to balanced at 1440p. Over 100fps 90% of the time. Incredible experience.  *With a 4070 ti and 13600k",Positive
Intel,"I mean, Path tracing is to Ray tracing, what Ray tracing is too rasterization.",Neutral
Intel,When Cyberpunk first came out the 3090 only got 20 fps in RT Psycho mode.  https://tpucdn.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-founders-edition/images/cyberpunk-2077-rt-3840-2160.png  Still does  Fast forward just one gem and you don't see anyone saying its demanding with many able to get RT Psycho on thier cards as new cards got faster.  Give it 2 gens and you are going to get 4k60 here.  Gpu will improve and get faster.,Neutral
Intel,"Look at that, my 6700XT is just 19fps slower than the RTX 4090 in this title.",Negative
Intel,It's a good thing nobody has to actually play it native.,Neutral
Intel,Well good thing literally nobody is doing that…,Negative
Intel,The future is not in native resolution so this is really pointless information.  Cyberpunk looks absolutelt mindblowlingy insane with all the extra graphical bells and whistles it has gotten over the years and with Nvidia’s technology it runs so damn smooth as well.,Positive
Intel,4.3fps lol. No amount of upscaling is going to fix that and make it playable. People were saying the 7900xtx had 3090ti levels of RT when it launched. A 4060 ti is 50% faster then it.,Negative
Intel,That's actually pretty amazing for any GPU to get a metric in frames per second instead of minuites per frame.,Positive
Intel,"Meh I get like 90+ fps with everything cranked with RR, FG and DLSS(Balanced) toggled on with my 4090 @ 4k.  Path tracing does introduce ghosting which is annoying buts not really noticeable most times but at the same time with RR enabled it removes shimmering on 99% of objects that is normally introduced with DLSS so I am willing to compromise.   Honestly as someone who used to have a 7900XTX I am disappointed with AMD its clear that AI tech in gaming is the way forward and they just seem so far behind Nvidia now and even Intel(going by some preview stuff). FSR is just not even comparable anymore.",Negative
Intel,Who cares when it looks worse than with dlss and ray reconstruction on top of running a lot worse? Native res 4k is pointless.,Negative
Intel,"Well the upscaling in this game is really good, DLSS with ray reconstructions AI accelerated denoiser provides better RT effects than the game at native with its native Denoiser.  Also Path tracing scales perfectly with resolution so upscaling provides massive gains. using DLSS quality doubles performance to 40fps, and dlss balanced gives 60fps on average, performance about 70-80 or 4x native 4K, that includes the 10-15% performance gain RR gives as well over the native denoiser as well.  I've been playing with about 60fps on average 50-70. with DLSS Balanced and RR and its been amazing. I don't like frame gen tho since it causes VRR flickers on my screen",Positive
Intel,"Running Ray Tracing or Path Tracing without DLSS or Ray Reconstruction is like intentionally going into a battlefield without any gear whatsoever, it's absolutely pointless and suicidal, what we can clearly see here though is top of the line 7900 XTX losing against already mediocre mid-range 4060 Ti by over 50%, which is just beyond embarrassing for AMD Radeon.  All this says to me is AMD Radeon need to get their shit together and improve their RT / PT performance, otherwise they will continue to lose more Marketshare on GPU department no matter how hard their fanboys thinks that they are pointless features, just like DLSS was back on 2020 right?  Also, with my 4070 Ti OC i can run it at average of over 60 FPS at 1440p DF optimized settings with DLSS Balanced + Ray Reconstruction without even using DLSS Frame Gen, with it on i can get over 80+ FPS",Negative
Intel,Running this way means you lose RR…why in the world would you run at native 4k?  It’s completely pointless now with RR.,Negative
Intel,Im having 80 fps  thanks to dlss 3.5  and its looking better than ever,Positive
Intel,"Why would I run native? I have amazing DLSS, ray reconstruction for huge image gains and frame gen. Nvidia offering all the goodies.",Positive
Intel,"I have a 13900KF-4090 rig and a 7800X3D-7900XTX rig. They are connected to a C2 OLED and to a Neo G9.  I've been holding on to play the game till 2.0 update. I've tried many times with different ray-tracing options and they all look good and all. But in the end I closed them all, turned back to Ultra Quality without ray-tracing and started playing the game over 120FPS.  This is a good action fps game now. I need high fps with as low latency as possible. So who cares about ray-tracing and path-tracing.  Yeah ray-tracing and path-tracing are good. But we are at least 2-3 generations away for them to become mainstream. When they are easily enabled on mid-range gpus with high-refresh rate monitors, they will be good and usable then :)",Positive
Intel,"If you have the HW, go all out. That's why we spend on these things.  I'm getting the best experience you can get in the premiere visual showcase of a good game.   It's path tracing.

Intel,"""Get Nvidia if you want a good ray tracing experience""  Yes Nvidia GPUs give a better ray tracing experience but is it really worth it if you are required to turn on DLSS? Imo, the more AI-upscaling you have to turn on, the worse the Nvidia purchase is.   I have a 6900XT and I will readily admit that the RT experience (ultra RT, no path tracing) at native 1080p resolution is ok, like 30-45 FPS (around 50 on medium RT settings), but if I turn RT lighting off (so RT shadows, sunlight, and reflections are still present) suddenly I get pretty consistent 60 FPS (i left my frames tied to monitor refresh rate, so 60 FPS is my max) and i can't tell the damn difference at native 1080p compared to RT medium or Ultra.   So would I spend another $400-$1000 to get an imperceptible outcome (imperceptible to me that is)? Most definitely not.",Negative

Intel,Sounds like Ray tracing isn’t ready for prime if nothing can run it and you have to use AI smoke and mirrors to fake it playable.

Intel,"Once they introduced this dlss upscaling anti-lag all these gimmicks I don't think we've seen true 4K native and almost anything lately.  This is maybe one game that does look that good but many of the games don't look that great and have some really serious system requirements when there are games that look much better and are much better optimized.  Companies are taking shortcuts, instead of optimizing they give you suboptimal and use FSR dlss all these gimmicks.  Don't get me wrong I always thought it was great for people who wanted to reach a certain frames per second someone with a weaker system to allow them to play at least the minimal at a steady frame rate.  It just seems like this is the normal now non-optimized games.  The 4090 is a beast if you could only get about 20 frames native with Ray tracing it tells you everything you need to know about Ray tracing.  It needs to be reworked that needs to be a new system I believe one real engine has it built in in a certain way probably not as good as Ray tracing directly.  To me it seems like ray tracing is hampering many games that tried to add it, too much focus on that instead of actual making a good game.  Let's daisy chain 4 4090s ..gets 60 fps.. and then house goes on fire!  Obviously I'm being sarcastic but realistically it's actually pretty sad a 4090 20 frames per second.",Negative

Intel,"Does this fact really matter tho? Dlss in cyberpunk is known the look on par or even better than native, frame generation will further smooth it out.

In all honesty, turning everything up to 11 on my 3090 doesn't net much visual gain beyond some mirror like reflections and nothing I really care about when actually playing the game (compared to standard High/Ultra) and not pixel peeping, which seems to be the new game now for people buying expensive GPUs, so they can justify their purchase.

Intel,"Plus frame generation works very well in Cyberpunk in terms of image quality. In some games, you need to get closer to ~80 fps output for an acceptable image quality with FG. But the FG in CP2077 is decent with 60 fps output, ~~and I get ~65-70 fps output with quality DLSS + FG at 4k on a 4090.~~ EDIT: I misremembered what I was getting. With path tracing, DLSS quality, frame generation, and ray reconstruction, I got 80.1 fps with the benchmark!  Of course there's the matter of latency, and the latency of CP2077 with FG output of ~65-70 fps isn't great. So I'll often use DLSS balanced + FG. Thanks to ray reconstruction, this now looks very close enough native 4k (to my eyes), with acceptable latency (to me), at a high framerate output.",Positive
Intel,"Nvidia features are always useless until AMD copies them a year or two later, only then they become great features 😁",Positive
Intel,"Tbh, list the games that have ray tracing right now. Pretty few.  It's not about being a fanboy of amd, but ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick, not because it's unnoticeable or bad, just because it's not ""popular"" (I myself really like it). I would personally go amd over nvidia because those 50 or so euros more that nvidia has against the amd counter parts simply are too much for just better rt and  dlss. I could spend those for a better amd card with generally better performance.  Regarding dlss, personally I would just lower the graphics before resorting to kinda bad generated frames, fsr even worse. But that's my point of view.  I find that amd still has to fix some driver issues but other than that, they are a fine brand. (so is nvidia)",Neutral

Intel,"This is a tech demo. That's the whole point. It's not really playable yet, but the game really is meant to showcase what is possible in the future and how close we are getting. That's what Nvidia is doing here by funding this whole project.  Crysis who many people are comparing this to, was in itself quite revolutionary for its time.

Intel,I would still argue it's still in proof of concept stage. The tech will only become viable once the flagship GPU'S start getting 4k 60fps at native. That will the allow the lower end GPU'S to get 4k 60 or 1440p 60 upscaled.,Neutral

Intel,Cyberpunk is more optimized than majority of games that came out in last two years. Just because you can't run it at 4k 120 fps with path tracing doesn't mean it's not optimized.,Positive

Intel,"Baked illumination requires you to choose where to add light sources and how the lighting is applied to everything, it's a creative choice of the author, the AI needs instructions to know what to do, so it would need constant handholding, on the other hand RT uses simple physics to calculate how light bounced and NN to apply the light on surfaces.",Neutral
Intel,But the destructable environment and the water graphics and other things in Direct X 9 made high end pcs kneel as well.  I remember playing on my 9800gtx/+ with my Intel Q9300 quad core (lapped and oc'ed to 3.0ghz - EDIT: checked some old evga posts got it to 3.33ghz) with 2x4gigs DDR2 @1000mhz cas 5 trying to maintain a sustained 30fps at 900p resolution on my 1680x1050 monitor. And I oc'ed the crap out of that 9800gtx 835 mhz (cant recall if it was unlinked shadder or not now) core on blower air (won the silicon lottery with that evga card).  Tweaking settings was mostly user done and guided with old school limited forum help. Ahh the good old days of having lots of time during school breaks.,Neutral
Intel,"The equivalent of a 4090 at the time, 8800 ultra (768MB) got 7.5 fps at 1920x1200 very high quality. The other cards were not able to run it. Even the lowest tier last generation card runs this, even though it's at 5% speed.",Neutral
Intel,No and no again lol  The 8800gtx could do 1152x864 high and that was the top dog. DX9 cards could do that at medium but high shaders was like a 25fps average tops and that dropped into the teens on the snow level.   It took things like the gtx480 and HD 6970 to do 1920x1080 30fps max settings. That's before getting into Sandy Bridge being the first cpu that could sustain 40+ fps if the gpu power was there.   Crysis came during the core 2 duo/k8 athlon and first wave dx10 cards era and it took *2 more generations* of *both* gpus and cpus to do it some justice.,Neutral

The shattering glass with PhysX turned on absolutely TANKED my framerates, like single digit. I didn't realize that the PhysX toggle was turned on in the settings. This was at a time when PhysX required a dedicated PCIe card in your system.   Once I turned it off it ran fine. Now I can run that game at ridiculous framerates without my system getting warm.",Positive

Intel,"Do keep in mind that despite both being named the same, the devil's in the details. Movies use way more rays per scene and way more bounces too.   Path tracing in CP2077 shows temporal artifacts due to denoising, something that doesn't happen in movies. It is being improved with the likes of DLSS 3.5, but it is still quite off when compared to said movies.",Neutral

Intel,"> Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story  Toy Story didn't use path tracing though, A Bug's Life was Pixar's first movie to use ray tracing (not path tracing) and only for a few frames in the entire movie for specific reflections, they started using ray tracing more generally for Cars and I can't find exactly when they started using path tracing but it should be around the early 2010s which is also when the other Disney animation studios started using path tracing",Neutral
Intel,No it's not a miracle. Because it's downscaled a lot and also uses lower quality math and piggybacking on AI to make up for it. It's basically running through 3 layers of cheats to produce results that aren't that much better than just traditional raster.,Negative

Intel,4090 getting 60fps at 4k balanced dlss with no frame gen. 100 with frame gen. I can make it drop into the 20s if I stand right next to a fire with all the smoke and lightening effects or if I go to a heavily vegetated area it’ll drop to mid 40s.

Intel,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-dlss-35-tested-ai-powered-graphics-leaves-competitors-behind  Well it's so close (54fps) it's more like a 3080Ti or higher from 3000 series or a 4070TI + from 4000 series it seems? The old 3000 series is punching way above it weight vs the 7900xtx, which was meant to deliver similar RT performance to the 3090.. which it doesn't.",Neutral

Intel,I got a stupidly good deal on the 4090(buddy won an extra one from a company raffle) and it just so happened my XTX was one of the cards suffering from the mounting issue on release.  Honestly very happy that all of that happened.

Intel,"Nvidia used cp77 as a testing grounds for their dlss3 and rt tech, it'd no surprise it looks and performs relatively good, they literally partnered with cdpr for that.  Do not expect these levels of RT on most games anytime soon, probably in a couple years (with rtx 5000 series) the tech will be more mature and not as taxing for most cards, because needing to upscale and use framegen to get 60fps on an RT PT setting is kinda absurd.",Positive

Intel,"There are a lot of new games that features Ray Tracing on them as of now, too bad most of them doesn't look as visually as good as they could be though as most of the time their RT effects are dumbed down or reduced to the point it's pointless.  But the thing is that wasn't the point even from the beginning, RT Overdrive on Cyberpunk is literally considered as a Technological showcase  What matters here IMO for all of us is PC platform in general is showcasing here what a real high-end computers can achieve beyond what current gen console can do, and they are showcasing it really well here on Cyberpunk with much better visuals and using plenty of tricks to make them more than playable, where they shouldn't be considering how much demanding they are over standard, that is impressive enough to me and shows a good sign of technological engineering innovation.   As what Bryan Catanzaro said on his interview on DF Direct, work smarter not harder, brute force is not everything, of course it still matters a lot but doing it alone is starting to become pointless just like how it is on real life.",Negative

Intel,Nice but ive been playing video games since the 70s and its Shit end off..,Negative
Intel,The future of frame generation is going to be huge. I can definitely see 360p frame rendering upscaled to 4k with 80% maybe even 90% of the frames being generated. All with equal to or even better visual quality.   A 20 FPS game like this will become a 100-200fps game.  We may be looking at the end of beefy graphics cards being required to play games. Just a good enough mid or low tier chip (granted 5-10 years from now) with frame generation might be enough.,Positive
Intel,"After 2.0, it's around 100""fps"". Just 60""fps"" (meaning with FG enabled) is far from being playable due to latency. You need at least 90""fps"" for playable experience.   Cyberpunk PT vs RT is a huge difference in terms of graphics, while DLSS Quality vs Balanced is really slim in comparison. What you say would be a really bad trade-off.   At 1440p DLSS Quality it's easily 120+""fps"" which is perfectly comfortable.",Neutral

Intel,Pixar movies will sometimes take the better part of a day to render a single 4k frame on a render farm. So the fact that Cyberpunk takes more than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame in its path-tracing mode on a single 4090 clearly means that it's unoptimized garbage! /s  EDIT: Apparently people in this thread don't understand sarcasm (or don't understand how a path-traced game can take longer than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame with high-poly path tracing and still be optimized).,Negative

Intel,LOL I remember this exact scene also.,Neutral
Intel,"CPU PhysX back then was single-threaded and relied on ancient x87 instructions if I recall correctly, basically gimped on purpose.

Intel,"No, you could actually install two Nvidia cards and dedicate one of them to only PhysX.",Neutral
Intel,"It would certainly be possible, but it wouldn't really make sense. Splitting it up on multiple GPUs would have a lot of the same problems that sli/crossfire had. You would have to duplicate memory, effort, and increase latency when you composite the final image.  It may or may not make sense to maybe have a raster chiplet and a ray tracing chiplet on the same processor package on a single gpu. But, probably makes more sense to have it all on one chiplet, and just use many of the same chiplet for product segmentation purposes instead.   A separate PPU did make sense tho, I'm still annoyed that the nvidia ageia deal essentially kill the PPU in the cradle. Our gaming rigs would cost more if PPUs became a thing, but we could have had a lot better physics then we do today. There is still a revolution in physics to be had some day...",Negative
Intel,would be cool if 2000/3000 series users could get a small tensor core only PCIe card to upgrade to framegen,Positive
Intel,"That's true, but if he's talking about *the equivalent* of a current $200-class card, I'd say about it's 10 years, what do you think?",Neutral
Intel,At least with the 4090 you can run 70% power target and still hit insane FPS while only pulling around 300w which is the same as my old 3080. The gains with that extra 150w are a couple percent at best. Not worth it to me.,Negative

Intel,"They are still the same thing and should be named the same, your disclaimer is just semantics about the implementation.",Neutral
Intel,"Weird argument.  Traditional raster is cheats upon cheats upon cheats already.  In fact, all of the lighting entirely in raster is essentially cheats.",Negative
Intel,It will not work well/look good using a single frame worth of data either due to the low ray counts. Digital Foundry has shown Metro Exodus builds the lighting over ~20 frames or so and it seems like Cyberpunk is even more. Even Cyberpunk ray pathtracing doesn't look as good in motion due to that same build-up effect.  You need to cast 20-50x the rays to have enough data for a single frame but then you will be measuring the game performance by seconds per frame.,Negative
Intel,"RT looks significantly better than raster when it’s not just using simple reflections like a Far Cry 6. Raster is all cheats, the so called reflections are essentially rendering the scene or part of the scene being reflected in reverse then applying fake material effects to mimic metal, water, etc. Raster also takes HUNDREDS to thousands of person hours to get the fake reflections and lighting to look decent to good. That’s why devs love RT and want it to grow, as RT/hardware does the work for them.",Negative

Intel,It's not a perfect way of measure but you can clearly see how (at least on Nvidia GPUs) the 8/10GB cards are way behind the >11Gb cards. Meaning you need 11 or 12GB of VRAM for this scenario which cripples the 3080 but not the 3060.  We said from the start these configurations are shit but no-one listened. There you go.,Negative
Intel,The crypto miners did me a comical solid by preventing me from acquiring many countless times and hours I wasted (came from a gtx1070 before finally being able to upgrade). Was able to get my 6900xt eventually for around $600 with 2 games. Becoming increasing thankful for the extra Vram these days.   Once I start getting through my game backlog and into the gard hitting ray tracing ones will hopefully upgrade to something with at least 24gigs of GDDR# lol.,Positive

Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090). That's substantially faster than than how fast a 4090 runs Cyberpunk on the path tracing mode. Presumably, a less complex world helps, but they may also have implemented opacity micro maps, which I'm not sure if Cyberpunk has done in the 2.0 update. Perhaps they're cherry-picked examples for the trailer.",Neutral

My upgrade back then was to the Evga 560ti DS, which I ended up installing a backplate and  a gelid cooler. They had wayy better thermal tape/individual heatsinks for the memory/vram chips for the heat transfer.

Intel,"There was more nuance to that ""bugfix"" than just ""it was a bug that got fixed""   Modders were able to re-enable the AMD/NVIDIA PhysX combo basically immediately via editing DLLs.  Not driver replacements, but actual DLL tweaks.  The speed at which modders were able to fix what NVIDIA ""broke"" combined with the public outrage put them in a funny legal spot.  If they continued with PhysX disabled and claiming it was a bug then the bug can easily be fixed, as shown by modders doing it first.  So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.  Obviously not many modern games use the GPU implementation of PhysX anymore and the performance difference between current GPU and CPU implementations are negligible anyway, but their intent at the time was clear once it was shown how quickly modders were able to get everyone back to normal.",Neutral

Intel,I like how you said: static image  because in motion upscaling is crappier,Negative
Intel,"It isn't a weird argument. Rasterization is premised on approximating reality, while RT is simulating it.  The extreme few amount of rays we trace right now, including bounces, means effects are often muted and the performance hit is enormous. To compensate, we're using temporal upscaling from super low resolutions *and* frame interpolation.  Temporal upscaling isn't without it's issues, and you know how much traditional denoisers leave to be desired. Even Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction leaves a lot to be desired; the thread on r/Nvidia shows as much, with ghosting, artifacts, etc. all over again. It's like the launch of DLSS 2.0.  All of that, for effects that are oftentimes difficult to perceive, and for utterly devastating traditional rasterization performance.",Negative
Intel,"It's a shame raster is so labor intensive, because it looks so interesting when done right.     I look at screenshots from cyberpunk, Raster / Ray Trace / Path Trace, and in most of them the raster just looks more interesting to me. Not constrained by what would be real physical lighting. The 100% RT render versions of old games like Quake gives a similar feeling.

In HDR that ""bloom"" looks awesome as it's super bright like it would be in real life but still not losing any details. You lose those details only on those SDR videos.  PT just looks and feels way more natural than just RT, when only raster literally looks like it was two different games from two different hardware generations.

You’re in denial if you think otherwise.  I’m not tied to either brand. I have an AMD CPU bc it was the best option for what I wanted, and a Nvidia GPU for the same reason.

The 4060ti gets 6.6 fps. Let's assume a next gen flagship is able to reach 60 fps at 4k. That would theoratically allow the 60ti card to reach around 20 fps.

I wish Nvidia introduced a ""Ultra Quality"" preset that would be say 80% per axis resolution, something between DLAA and DLSS Quality. At 1440p this would be 2048x1152.",Positive
Intel,"Speaking of the AMD overlay, am I the only one that gets near zero CPU utilization every time they pull it up?

Intel,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",Neutral

Intel,"I actually agree with you, but I don't need the metric to be some scientifically accurate reading of performance or whatnot, I just think it'd be a useful tool for adjusting game settings.

Is there a bottleneck, where is it, and am I relieving pressure on it with these settings or not?",Neutral
Intel,It’s where you oc in adrenaline,Neutral
Intel,"There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Not because upscaling, but also because how important is to have drivers that work in tandem with specialized hardware units in the GPU.  Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  AMD fails hard on 2 of those things.  Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.",Positive
Intel,"Yep, XeSS is just great, I happily use it in MWII on my Arc A770. But I still use DLSS on NVIDIA. But both are better than FSR.",Positive
Intel,"Then you should be looking at ***GPU*** usage, because CPU usage will not help you answer any of those questions",Negative
Intel,"Problem is, by itself it still tells you little to nothing. If GPU utilization drops like a brick you know something is bottlenecking. If CPU utilization changes in the absence of other data you know absolutely nothing of value.   The real kicker is the CPU utilization may not even be ""wrong"", it may just be polling at a very low rate because that's the other thing with these OSDs if you poll too frequently for up-to-date data that can kill performance from the overhead.",Negative
Intel,"> There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  Yep, tools like [this one from NVIDIA](https://youtu.be/-IK3gVeFP4s?t=51) have made it easier than ever as a dev to optimise for NVIDIA hardware.  > AMD fails hard on 2 of those things. Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.  Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts. Arc is just getting started, give Intel 5-10 years of time in GPU and they will outpace AMD for sure.",Positive
Intel,"There are many settings that directly impact CPU usage, so of course CPU utilization reading can be useful.  Not everything needs to be precisely accurate, this is a lousy defense. Getting 0% reads all the time is entirely worthless but some accurate reads is still useful information.",Neutral
Intel,"You are going out of your way to defend a broken feature.    7800X3D shows up as 1% CPU utilization during games such as Watch Dogs, Stellaris, Age of Empires. Clearly broken. Undefendable.",Neutral
Intel,"And with a bit of luck, they will also hit AMD in the console market.  Right now AMD stays afloat GPU speaking because consoles, they were during a lot of years the only vendor offering both CPU and GPU in a single package, reducing costs A LOT.  Nvidia was not able to compete against that with the lack of CPUs and Intel with the lack of GPUs.  Now that Intel is working on dedicated GPUs they are going to eventually create APU like products, its just the natural outcome of producing both CPUs and GPUs.  And then AMD will NEED to compete against them instead of being the only option.  And if that happens, unless FSR gets turned into a hardware specific tech like XeSS that falls into different techs depending on the GPU its running on, AMD will be murdered.  Better software stack, better general hardware to accelerate and improve upscalling keeping costs down AND being a second player pushing prices down towards Sony and Microsoft?  AMD will be screwed up if they don't up their game. And hard.",Neutral
Intel,"Right, so what kind of useful information can you tell me if I raise graphics settings and CPU utilization goes from 12-16% to 16-17% while framerate goes down from 120 fps to 110 fps?",Neutral
Intel,"All CPU utilization tells anyone is thread scheduling, and nothing about what the threads are or aren't doing. Like the only situation that it marginally tells someone anything is how many threads a program uses. But that usually doesn't fluctuate with games, games usually scale up to <x> number of threads and that is that. GPU utilization is the one that is far more useful for spotting bottlenecks, general performance observations are far more useful for tweaking.  Even Intel and co. will tell you that with modern processors and all the elements they contain as well as hyperthreading/SMT CPU utilization isn't a very useful stat anymore. Meant a whole lot more when CPUs were one core unit and didn't also include the FPU and memory controller and everything else.",Neutral
Intel,"Cause unfortunately even if it wasn't broken, it's not useful in any meaningful capacity. Should it be broken? No. Would anything notable come of it if it were fixed? Also no. Given the bugs they got and room for improvement elsewhere it's one of those things that should be super low on the priority list or just removed wholesale.",Negative
Intel,"That whatever setting you are changing does not have much of an impact on CPU utilization, and if your GPU allows, you can use it.  What is the purpose of this question, are you really not aware of any settings that impact CPU usage? Some RT settings have big impacts on CPU usage too.",Neutral
Intel,"The problem you're missing here is that settings that are CPU demanding generally don't have an easily observable impact on CPU usage, if they have any impact at all.  The reliable way to see if a setting is CPU demanding is to turn it up, see the frame rate go down, and then look at how **GPU** usage changed.",Neutral

Intel,"I mean no offense, but Passmark is irrelevant.  Even comparing the 890m to the 7600m (non-xt), the 7600m is usually twice as fast, with dips down to ~60% faster, and lifts up to ~170% faster.     NoteBookCheck has an extremely robust dataset of benchmarks in games for both the 890m and the 7600m (non-xt) at various resolutions, and they show not only a clear winner, but a very large difference in the performance of these devices.      Now I'm not trashing what the B390 will be, because we need an iGPU fight here.  But thinking that the 7600m (non-xt) is only ~15.7% faster than the B390 ((new-old)/old gives percent change) because of Passmark is erroneous.",Neutral

Intel,There are 2 dies.  One for professional workload which will be mass produced.  Second is for gaming. Even a 10-12 core xe3 will be barely enough for modern 1080p.

Intel,"While I haven't used it daily or anything, and I've only done initial setup on the Lunar Lake, the feedback we've gotten both on Arrow Lake and for Lunar Lake (e.g. 268V and 265H) Dell models is that it's a big increase in battery life and performance. The integrated graphics (e.g. 140V and 140T) are very capable compared to a **workstation** grade NVIDIA Ada 500 GPU, but they are not even comparable to a gaming GPU like the GeForce 4060 or even a 5050.  The integrated graphics do however get used for 99% of all workloads unless explicitly specified because they are vastly more battery efficient and draw less power compared to a dedicated NVIDIA chip, meaning you can have a much smaller external power supply, and your graphics performance in those basic desktop workloads with one of these chipsets will be **much** better than previous generation Intel chips. Exceptions are obviously something like gaming or AutoCAD that specify to use the high performance dedicated graphics chip.  140V/140T are barely functional for modern AAA gaming, but if you stay 5-10 years back for AAA titles you might be okay. It will smoke most Indie games. Just look at the per title benchmarks for a 140V/140T and you can see if your game benches. You could probably get away with a lot of functional mobile gaming without a dGPU, but I wouldn't expect to be able to play a recent Call of Duty or Black Myth or anything with anything like an acceptable framerate at a decent resolution. This integrated graphics chip compares very favorably to its more common Ryzen 7 equivalent, I believe the 780M, and it's a very good APU for handhelds overall due Lunar Lake's power efficiency compared to other X86 chips.  You have to understand that for these next two generations Intel seems to be making big strides in terms of both power efficiency and integrated graphics for mobile, it's a very attractive option and the first time I've seriously considered a laptop without a dGPU. I think Panther Lake is going to be a very nice kit next year for both laptops and handhelds and give AMD a run for its money.   I suspect AMD genuinely needs a new APU graphics architecture implemented next year to keep up, which I expect them to. Not a bad problem to have.",Positive
Intel,"Yeah for sure. It's a small die and should be yielding pretty high. See also the number of 4+8+4 SKUs. Looks like the larger CPU tile is also yielding decently, so not a ton to cut down.  I'm partly saying that because a larger Intel3 die was certainly possible. Even if it was 6 Xe3 cores and built as half of the larger die (just one of the two render slices)  it would fill the void a bit more.",Positive

Intel,I don't see anything wrong with asking for actual benchmark information especially when there isn't anything official. X3D is nice but it isn't the end all be all. I would be curious to see if Intel can manage to compete.,Neutral
Intel,"Oh I totally agree, but it would've been nice you know? Jumping to 6 Xe3 is a  significant area increase for a tiny tile. I understand exactly why the 4-10 gap exists, but I can't say I don't wish there was something to fill that gap if only because it looks weird.  I expect the big CPU tile and small GPU tile pairing will find its way into a number of gaming laptops as the iGPU performance is pretty low on the priority list for those.",Neutral
Intel,"PTL's main changes are fixing MTL/ARL's terrible SoC design, which should net a few % performance. It'll see a mild IPC increase, getting a few more % performance. And it'll lose a bit of clockspeed, erasing most of those gains.  Expect PTL to be very similar performance to ARL, but with lower power consumption, a much better iGPU, and most importantly to Intel: Using their own fabs instead of TSMC.  It absolutely won't be X3D in gaming.  Edit: Actually shocked that people think this would compete with X3D.  9955HX3D is \~16% faster than a 275HX in gaming...and a 275HX itself is easily 10%+ faster than a 285H in gaming.  Not even Intel themselves are claiming this. Their own marketing refers to PTL as ""ARL performance with LNL efficiency"". Nobody realistically expects PTL-H to see a 25%+ gaming improvement over ARL-H. The fact that IPC increase is less than 10% and clockspeed is slightly lower than ARL-H should make this obvious",Neutral
Intel,CGC is a LNC tick. This is well known at this point. And we see it's even a clock speed regression.    Even entertaining the notion it will close the gap to AMD's X3D chips is just delusional.,Neutral
Intel,"Oh, yeah, I get you. Wish they could give more granularity. Just personally think some sacrifices are worthwhile if it can condense Intel's mobile lineup back down to something sane again.   > I expect the big CPU tile and small GPU tile pairing will find its way into a number of gaming laptops as the iGPU performance is pretty low on the priority list for those.  Yeah, should be a good fit. Shame they don't have anything with a bit more CPU umph, though. 4+8+4 and only up to 5.1GHz is *fine*, but not great. Especially without an HX replacement.",Neutral
Intel,"Two options seems right, either you care about it or you don't.",Neutral
Intel,"Its not ""delusional"" to want to see actual numbers instead of speculation. I have been in this game long enough to see plenty of speculation even with accurate information not give the actual numbers.",Negative
Intel,"Given how well ARL HX was received in gaming laptops, I think they may wait to have something from NVL take that top spot. 5.1ghz does seem low though. ARL-H will happily do 5.4 and 18A should clock decently, though I suppose that's a sacrifice for the 25W TDP.  I suspect these may not be totally final clocks though they do seem reasonable.",Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, surprised ARL-HX is doing as ok as it is. The deficits of the architecture in gaming are well known. If it could hit the same clocks and core counts, PTL should look a lot better still. And all that besides, ARL's cost structure is horrible. For Intel's own sake, the sooner they move on, the better.   > and 18A should clock decently, though I suppose that's a sacrifice for the 25W TDP  From the same leaker, these chips are at 65W or even 80W TDPs, so they're not merely power limited. It seems that 18A just significantly underperform some expectations, though in line with some rumors and the gist of the revisions Intel's been making to its projections over the last year or two.  > I suspect these may not be totally final clocks though  If they're defining SKUs and such, these clocks need to be finalized for all practical purposes.",Negative
Intel,"If I'm reading correctly those are max power limits, not the TDP,  though I get what you mean. The 285H sits at a 45W TDP and tops out at 115W. Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  As for why ARL HX is doing well in gaming laptops, I think a good bit of that is also part of what made it lackluster on desktop. It doesn't really scale up that well with higher TDPs and power limits, but it does seem to scale down. The 285HX with its 55W TDP and 160W max limit doesn't perform far off the 125W TDP and 250W max of the 285K.  It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system. The 9955HX3D is very impressive, but quite a lot of laptop buyers seem to value the ability to do more laptop-like things with their gaming laptops than the extra frame rate. I'm hoping this gets shaken up as AMD adopts new packaging tech as seen in Strix Halo.",Neutral
Intel,"> If I'm reading correctly those are max power limits, not the TDP, though I get what you mean. The 285H sits at a 45W TDP and tops out at 115W. Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  Not guaranteed given it's just a twitter leak, but I'm assuming the leaker is using the term TDP consistently with Intel's historical usage, i.e. PL1. For ARL, 115W is PL2. I would also assume there wouldn't be the disclaimer about it being hard to cool if they cut the PL2 so much, though PowerVia does create some interesting complications there, so maybe not quite apples to apples.  Either way though, don't think it should have much impact on ST boost. You're talking a good 70%-ish of power going to compute, so even at 65W PL2, that's still 40-50W available for one core. Should be *easily* sufficient to hit whatever the silicon is capable of.  > It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system.  Yes, and this is something I've very much looking forward to with NVL-HX. At this point, the biggest demerit of the -HX platform vs -H is the use of standard DDR5 vs LPDDR. That's because it's still based on the desktop silicon with the different SoC/hub tile. But with NVL using a shared SoC die, they should be able to offer an -HX platform with the core counts people expect (though probably limited to single die 8+16), but the power/battery life advantages of -U/-P/-H. In general, should help make the -HX more of a straight-up upgrade than the tradeoffs one faces today.  AMD has this situation even worse today, because there's a much bigger gap between their desktop SoC architecture and the mobile one. Though as you say, they may also bring them closer together in the future.",Neutral

Like for like on TDP, this would be a solid improvement given the GPU both has to be moved off-tile compared to Lunar Lake, and has twice as many CPU cores to fight for power.

Intel,"e cores are surprisingly powerful now, and games are getting more multithreaded. It might be better to spread them out over 8 less power hungry cores than 4 P cores and then spill over to the slower cores. Especially in a laptop environment where efficiency matters and the GPU is usually holding back gaming performance so much that CPU performance is really not that important.  In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread. But most importantly, it doesn't do so evenly. Maybe you don't need something assigned to e cores, or the e core task is light and doesn't hold up the other threads. Then things will run at the pace of the P cores, but every now and then you'll have a slowdown.",Neutral

Gaming benchmarks tend to have a really strong feedback loop that favors last gen hardware design though.

Yeah 9950X should outperform it technically I guess but the split L3 between two CCDs probably holds back the advantage of having more cores.  Yeah sadly there's no benchmark for Bannerlord. But supposedly it does disperse its tasks to plenty of threads.   Here's some benchmarks showing core and thread usage in a few games. While the benchmark tool doesn't get into the details of how those software behave obviously, but at least according to the graphs some games like Tarkov really suck at distributing its tasks to several cores but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.

Intel,">12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark  It's because Creation Engine 2 worked better with Intel hardware until AM5 X3D chips, and 12900K great result in this test just shows that it's still a good CPU with 8 Performance cores, not that it's core count matters in any significant way - for example, 7700X delivers identical performance with lower core count/threads.  >lower clock speed than even 7700X  Clock speeds can't be compared between different architectures, different architecture = different efficiency, what matters is IPC.  >shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much  [here's a better example where more intel CPUs are present in Starfield test](https://youtu.be/XXLY8kEdR1c?t=29m5s), as you can see, increased core count/threads past 8 performance cores and 16 thread's is meaningless and won't provide any noticeable performance improvements, 6 faster P-cores on Intel 14600K provided better result than slower 8 P-cores on 12900K.   Going from 7950X to to 7700X results in 5 FPS loss, which is like 2-3% less FPS, and it's mostly because of lower clock speed(5.7Ghz Vs 5.4Ghz boost).   >but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.  That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.  Edit: typo",Positive

Same with Starfield.   That's because in video games, core count matters less than how fast the CPU can access or manipulate very dynamic types of data in a random memory address.    X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"". They're going to win in old or new games, and they're winning in games because they have a large buffer of low latency data. Not winning in productivity benchmarks because productivity is about processing matters more than accessing data, and its more easily multithreaded too in many cases.    But having more cores is still more advantageous in software and games that can occupy them.",Neutral

Point of discussion was to prove that games are using more than 16 threads or they're not - it seems like you overestimated Starfield, UE5 reliance on core count/threads and most games care about 16 threads at most.   >core count matters less  Yes, that's why I replied to that person and asked him to provide me with modern AAA games which are more ""multi-threaded"" now than AAA games a few years ago, I feel like what he ""observes"" is what he wants to believe, and not something that actually happened with optimization in games.  >X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"".  AMD sells 9950X3D, best productivity and gaming CPU, if you really need both(workloads/gaming) it's the optimal way, for an average user, only benefit of E-cores is lower power draw when idle - but they do matter more if you need those workloads, I agree, but we discussed gaming performance and core reliance.",Neutral

It's not like we have to guess what is what is big and what is coming. We know and what's coming is more AI and more graphical experiences.

Intel,"For them to do a 'big iGPU' design they would need to do a few things:  1. Use a different socket.  The iGPU will get too big for the existing one.  2. Upgrade the memory bus to 256bit.  That uses some power and silicon.  3. Add cache to the chip for the iGPU to use (to make up for the poor bandwidth they get from LPDDR5, even with a wider bus)  If they don't do this then the chip (which again won't fit in their default socket) will be massively bandwidth constrained to the degree that it's pointless.  Basically, do all the stuff that Strix Halo did.  Issue is Strix Halo didn't sell very well, the idea is a proof of concept and the concept needs faster memory to really work well.  LPDDR6 might help a lot at getting these big chip ideas from a XX60 level to a XX70 level, but they still require a lot of expensive chip work and a new motherboard design custom to the big socket.  I suspect we'll get there eventually, but it'll be a few years before people start calling it quits on dGPUs.",Neutral

The next big jump is LPDDR6 which looks to potentially hit a 50% bandwidth increase and marginally lower latency.

AMD,"This is just factually wrong. Look at GPU price history from MSRP to market price for the last year. GPU launches were incredibly inflated until these last 2 months, so what you think is ""black friday deals"" and ""cheap"" is what was supposed to be its original MSRP lol. Now this price hike is just to artificially raise the price to maintain the same profit margins they've had from the past year out of pure greed. No reason for AMD to raise prices on existing products on shelfs except for pure greed. No reason for RAM manufacturers to not offer long term contracts to large customers and OEMs when they are purposely causing a shortage, except for pure greed. No reason for Nvidia (who does not produce a large quantity of their FE GPUs themselves and relies on AIBs) to not bundle Vram with their dyes to the AIBs that have a smaller profit margin than Nvidia, except for pure greed.  20% of this is speculation of a AI bubble pop, the other 80% is companies seeing blood in the water and hopping on the price gouging train to artificially raise the prices for the whole industry.

They also spent way more on marketing because AMD had to spend huge amounts on CPU.  There you have it, the answer on why people buy Nvidia-cards. Not because those would be (always) necessarily better, but mostly out of the market's *brand-perception* — nVidia spent billions to fabricate their leader-image.  Same reason forwhy so many people still stick to Intel and answer questions about their CPUs with *""It's a i7!!""*.",Negative

One thing I noticed in the past from my years of PC experience is that your system will generally use less RAM if its going to be approaching the limit. This suggests that theres algorithms that will use disk space instead and/or do memory reallocations. There is a performance cost to this.  That said I think 32GB is a good amount of RAM, I rarely approach it.  However you never know what apps or games are leaking memory so having a lot is nice.",Neutral

AMD,"Platform longevity has to have some kind of financial value placed on it.   The maximum value of long platform longevity is the price of a motherboard. And you maximize this value if you buy into the very first generation on that platform. So every subsequent generation you enter in, the value of platform longevity goes down.   You also have to consider what impact generational improvements have on platform longevity. Zen 1 -> Zen 3 was a huge jump. Assuming Zen 7 on AM5, I don't think we're gonna see that level of improvement with Zen 4 -> Zen 7.  Let's say someone upgrades from AM4 to AM5 with the launch of Zen 6. They receive less value from platform longevity than someone who entered at Zen 4. And someone who bought in at Zen 4 will likely receive less value than someone who bought in at Zen 1.  So yes, platform longevity does have value. It's better to have platform longevity than to not have it.

AMD,"Maybe for an experienced builder, but to me (someone who's only built 1 PC) the prospect of just changing the CPU seems like a far less daunting task.  If you just want to replace the CPU, you unscrew 4 screws to remove your cooler/AIO pump head, pop open the socket, put your new CPU in, repaste and remount the cooler, plug some fans back in if necessary, and you're good. Maybe remove the GPU if you're really pressed for space.  When changing an entire motherboard, you have to unmount the cooler, remove the GPU, unplug every cable plugged into the motherboard, possibly remove some AIO fans/the radiator (or just fans in general) from the case if they're getting in the way of the motherboard screws, remove the motherboard, and remove any SSDs you want to reuse.   Then you have to put everything (CPU, SSDs, RAM) on the new motherboard, put the new motherboard in, repaste and remount the cooler, remount any fans you had to take off and plug them back into the motherboard, plug all your PSU cables again, then put your GPU back into place.  You basically have to redo a big chunk of the entire build process. Not to invalidate what you said, maybe you are proficient enough that all that would only take you 10 additional minutes.

AMD,"Adjusting for inflation doesn't really help, a lot of the older AMD cards dropped below MSRP pretty shortly after release (excluding 5700XT). I ended up getting my 6700XT for ~$290 USD.  Also in Australia it's currently possible to get a 9070 for a theoretical $425 USD excluding tax if you are able to use the $60 AUD store credit, $50 AUD gift card (easy since it can be Amazon), $20 USD Steam credit and ~$10 AUD cashback.",Neutral

AMD,"Got a 9070XT on Black Friday, now that they're so cheap I couldn't resist. Really impressed with it, performance is great, runs pretty cool and Adrenaline is really nice to play around with undervolting and overclocking. Got a real nice undervolt on it.",Positive
AMD,It's the best value for money gpu,Positive
AMD,"As a day 1 RX9070 owner, I can say I'm quite happy with it. I had some stability issues in windows early on, though those went away with driver updates and probably would've been completely avoided if I did a clean install, and it does suck when games only support the Nvidia features even though AMD has an alternative. Aside from that, performance has really solid. I play at 1440p, so regardless of the game I'm playing I know I can crank basically all the settings to the max, not bother with any of the upscaling, and still get FPS numbers well above 100.  Also, it does hurt knowing the ""best value GPU"" in 2025 is more expensive than *my entire rig* was back when I started. Not sure how anyone can afford to get into PC building nowadays if they're starting from zero.",Positive

AMD,"For people that havent been following since 2019:  5700XT 2019 launched at $400 (adjusted from $500), rivaled the 2070 super but had bad drivers for at least a year. Overall, underwhelming  6700XT launched at ??? But once available in 2022 it was generally under $430. Good drivers, and value. Overall, great GPU crushed under pressures of pandemic.  7700XT, trash. Dont even wanna talk about it.  7800XT launched $500 late 2023, delivering around 25% more perf than the 6700XT. Overall good launch/drivers.  7900GRE launched at $550, 2024. This GPU was an absolute mess. It launched super late, had weird underclocked memory issue at launch (despite it being around for a year in China already) and was priced too closely to the superior 7900XT.  9070 launched at $700 in 2025. Good GPU but completely crushed by the 5070 by value/availablility. FSR4 launched with limited implementation and heavy RT perf was only about a rtx 4070. Path tracing not really possible.",Negative
AMD,guessing it not worth upgrading from the 7900xt looking at those GRE numbers,Negative
AMD,"Any explanation for why the 7800XT beats the 7900 GRE at 1080P low/medium?  Is it that the greater amount of MCD:s in the 7900 GRE vs 7800 XT puts more pressure on the CPU, which results in a bottleneck on the 7900 GRE? Or is it just more MCDs = more latency = worse performance with high FPS due to latency?",Neutral

AMD,"And with how idiotic MS is liable to get with Windows, with the AI bubble visibly approaching explosion, the better Linux driver sit only makes a good deal better.",Negative
AMD,"Since you've not had it long, let me pass on some unsolicited advice:  Leave the undervolt off when not gaming. You won't eat up any extra wattage or anything, but it will ensure that you don't run into any issues with stability at low power states. Not that you're guaranteed to have issues, just that it sure makes things easier to diagnose when you KNOW it's not your ""OC."" Adrenaline makes it so easy that you might as well.   Additionally, when starting a new game and facing crashing, the absolute first thing you should do is cut your undervolt in half. It's astounding how much variation in stability you'll face with undervolts and different games.   For example, my 9070 XT is stable at -70mv in any synthetic benchmarks I can throw at it. But it wasn't 100% stable in Horizon Forbidden West until I dropped it down to -65mv. Then in Tiny Tina's Wonderlands I had to drop it down to -45mv to avoid the occasional crash.   But if I load up Horizon again, -65mv for 10 hours straight no problem.   Play around and figure it out. It's fun.",Neutral
AMD,"I mean, technically true but boy what a lame way to win. Only 20-25% faster than the 7900gre it replaced. I guess Moore’s Law really is dead",Negative

AMD,"Which is more important then you'd think with the total estrangement from reality down in Redmond nowadays. Even if you're not immediately planning to switch to linux or go dualboot (like me), with how loony toons shit is getting in that operation, being able to as painlessly GTFO of the MS ecosystem as possible on short notice is a capability worth planning for in a build for if and when MS finally does a dealbreaker for you.",Neutral

Agree in general but it was on sale multiple times for ~$360 with 2 bundled games, if you wanted or sold those it was a solid buy, arguably the best value card on the market at those discounts. 9060XT 16GB is marginally slower for the same money, albeit with better RT, upscaling and more VRAM.",Negative

AMD,"Getting 30% gen-on-gen in pure raster, with an even bigger uplift in RT and ML workloads on a smaller die is pretty good. To do it at a 40W lower TDP is really impressive. To get those uplifts purely from architectural improvements, with no real node shrink to speak of is completely absurd.  Also there are still very big gains to come with RDNA 5/UDNA.  Next gen will almost certainly be produced on N2P, skipping N3 entirely. It should yield performance uplifts almost as great as Maxwell -> Pascal, assuming AMD/Nvidia don't decide to shrink the dies massively.",Positive

AMD,"If we knew the actual margins AMD and NV were taking, we'd have a much better idea of the state of Moore's Law.

AMD,Thats the sad reality train we are on now. Pray that we actually even get these when quantum tunnelling gets worse.,Negative
AMD,"Probably more like 40%+ in ray tracing. It is still dead, but  also this architecture is more forward thinking, and spending its transistors on next generation stuff.   I'd imagine RDNA5 will be another big leap, and this will age more poorly in some regardless, compared to the RTX 5000 series from Nvidia. If Nvidia ages worse, it's because of artificial implanted software limits. Like they blocked frame generation on the RTX 3000 series.",Neutral

I know someone who snagged a 6800 brand new for $330 more than a year into the RDNA3 era. Also, supplies didn't dry up for a **long** time in many/most markets. It was basically a no-brainer. It was an equivalently-priced (or cheaper) 7700XT with more VRAM. There was zero reason to even consider a 7700XT throughout most of its run.",Neutral

AMD,"ML is irrelevant. You aren’t getting this card if you want to run LLMs. RT is borderline irrelevant. If you want to run RT in the latest games you will need something much more powerful than a mid range card like this. And lastly it isn’t 30% raster, its 20% in 1440p and 25% in 4k which is pretty disappointing.  The only thing that is pretty good about this card is that everything else is worse. It wins by virtue of being just disappointing in a market flooded with absolute garbage",Negative
AMD,"Fs and I can't wait to hear more about RDNA 5, but unfortunately it seems like it'll be radio silence until well into 2027. Look at how AMD handled RDNA 4 as well, nothing until one week prior to launch. Maybe a Cerny teaser for µarch at GDC 2027 with Road to PS6?

We already know they have postponed the 5000 series ""super"" release due to VRAM availability and cost.  (Their 6000 series workstation/server Blackwell GPUs use 96GB of DDR7 each).  They make a lot more money per RTX 6000 Pro Blackwell than a 5090, so they'll prioritize those and hike consumer prices in order to reduce demand there.",Negative
AMD,"AMD (and Nvidia) care about their data center consumers first because that’s where the money and the high margins are. Every wafer allocation and memory module that’s allocated to a gaming GPU is one less that could have gone into a data center GPU.

AMD,There are definitely times where that question can be easily and usefully answered,Neutral
AMD,"In general hardware has aged like open yoghurt out of the fridge.  Sometimes anomalies happen, it's not the first time.  I remember major price hikes and poor performance increases after the 9800pro ( x800 and x1800 sucked, hd series was little better until the hd4000) nvidia sucked after geforce 4 until the 8000 series.   People who bought gpus during the crypto boom at insane prices got fleeced. People who bought a 3060 ti or 3080 right before got lucky, people  who waited for a 4070super also got a better deal.  By the time the prices have started rising its too late.  If a gpu is available at msrp at launch you can rarely find better value later in the gen as prices dont drop anymore until the next gen. So yeah either buy at launch and msrp or wait for the next cycle   Imo if you are on a complete potato gpu now and need a cheap upgrade then second hand 3060ti are very cheap (190 euros) , else a 5070ti is the only thing id consider to have any performance/price right now. Everything else is either way more expensive for little gain, or has too little vram for the price. Or is too small an upgrade for the money over a cheap second hand 3060ti, or has poor second hand pricing.   5060 would be more interesting if the base model came with 12 GB and was priced at 250",Negative
AMD,"I remember 2 to 4 weeks before the 9070xt launch people were telling others to ""just buy a 7900xt"" for $700. I guess they got 4gb of extra VRAM out of it, but 95% will never use it. But I think there is a time to actually just wait, instead of buying $700 product that will be worth $500 in less than a month.",Negative
AMD,"500€? New? God damn thats a steal.  There used to be a general idea for buying hardware, *Just buy it when you need it, there is always the next big thing coming*, which still is in part true, but man with the volatility of the market since Corona Im 100% certain you can time your buys.",Negative

AMD,r/outside is leaking,Neutral
AMD,"Could be a pretty massive difference. Each AIB fighting to source memory on individual smaller contracts instead of NVIDIA just making one big deal for the entire production run, taking advantage of the scale to get it cheaper.",Neutral
AMD,Sure they are expanding GDDR7.  But for servers mostly.  RTX 6000 Pro Blackwell (96GB GDDR7) is a hot server GPU for inference use cases that aren't just the giant LLMs.  It is much more cost efficient than the B200 HBM offerings for all sorts of use cases that don't need to access too much RAM concurrently.  Several NVidia competitor hopefuls have also gone the GDDR route for inference focused AI accelerators.,Neutral
AMD,They're already sacrificing margins on making consumer GPUs instead of AI GPUs,Negative
AMD,"There are rumors that Nvidia will no longer be bundling VRAM with their GPUs in the face of rising memory prices, and AIBs will have to source it on their own.  While Nvidia may be ""absorbing costs"" on their FE models which have very limited production, for the vast majority of consumer graphics cards they're going to be passing on costs to the AIBs and thus consumers.   They have absolutely no incentive to absorb costs, anyway. Their entire consumer gaming graphics division is already being run at a massive opportunity cost to their real money maker, datacenter GPUs. It's frankly a miracle that they haven't decided to entirely scrap it yet when the same dies they're selling to consumers for a few grand at most can be sold to AI datacenters for tens of thousands.",Neutral
AMD,"\> absorb the costs if they desire  What makes you think they desire? They have a massive fraction of the market, and from a profit/investor POV raising prices is win/win here unless it somehow risks significant market share loss.",Neutral
AMD,"Agreed.  I’m just sort of surprised they would absorb the cost at all, tbh.",Negative
AMD,>Nvidia has much better margins on gaming GPUs so they can absolutely absorb the costs if they desire.  Which won't happen. Nvidia doesn't want to be a charity.,Negative
AMD,"True, and I recommend people get cards based on their needs/desires, never blanket recommend 1 company over the other.  I’m just surprised it’s AMD who might raise prices before Nvidia, even if they can absorb some of the cost.",Neutral
AMD,That's only a rumor and has not been confirmed.,Neutral
AMD,"Why are AMD's margins slimmer?  They're manufacturing at the same place using very similar technology. Their equivalent product is actually a little smaller than Nvidia's in terms of die size... they're a big TSMC customer, while obviously not as big as Nvidia they're not some small timer who can't negotiate a favourable deal either.  On this basis I would assume AMD and Nvidia have very similar margins on GPU sales to board partners.",Neutral
AMD,then why are AMD cards more expensive?,Negative
AMD,Still seeing $579.,Neutral
AMD,"When you've been there for 20 years and kept losing market share in the last decade continuously, you are in deep problem. But for AMD, right now they prefer being the SOC for gaming and have little interest in putting effort in dGPUs.",Negative
AMD,"I doubt Nvidia will raise prices they will most likely just stop producing FE""s. Which isn't the same as eating the cost or raising it.   Then AIB's will most likely raise pricing. That isn't due to Nvidia thats AIB's doing what they gotta do.   As far as priority gaming has never been the priority for Nvidia this generation. There priority is AI chips. Everything else is secondary to that.   AMD CPU division is basically printing money now. They want there GPU division to go anywhere. There going to need to be more competitive, right now there not.   They don't offer a better software stack, Ray tracing or anything to match the 5080 in performance. They also have a reputation of dropping support a LOT sooner then Nvidia  That means they need to become a value leader and why in the world would you pay the same or more for a 9700xt over a 5070 Ti?   Specially if the two are with in 50 dollars of each other or even 100 dollars of each other.",Negative
AMD,"Whelp if that rumors become the truth, then it is definitely right to expect the Nvidia GPUs will also get a price increase, i just wonder when it will happen and why AMD did it first with their RDNA 4...",Neutral
AMD,"Usually it's best not to buy during the post-launch rush when prices are way inflated, unless one can get one of the few actual MSRP offers.  Other than that, I totally agree that trying to predict the future is largely futile. Especially now that generational improvements have become so slow and low. Hardware holds its value for longer than ever before and the risk of buying a product only to see it depreciate it soon after is therefore also low.  People who bought any decently reviewed GPU at MSRP since the RTX 20-series have gotten pretty good value by now.",Negative
AMD,"9070 xt shouldn't be too bad either, considering it can be had for less than $/€600. Unless you're a big fan of AI upscaling.  Waiting for delivery now, I guess the shop has a bit of backlog after BF/CM.",Negative

AMD,>95% will never use it  And the other 5% could use 4 or 100? Or is the XTX too cheap for that?,Negative
AMD,"Sure, but how often can you predict something will drop that much? When the 5090 was announced didn't people sell their 4090s for as much as they bought them or slightly more? Also, if I'm going to use a GPU for 3 months, I'm not going to wait for it to drop in price.",Neutral

AMD,Brand new in the EU I’ve seen them go brand new for as little as €609 actually. He had it listed for €540 but I managed to haggle it down to €500. So roughly €100-€110 off MSRP?,Neutral
AMD,and proper setups cost quite a bit too.,Neutral
AMD,"Also means there's probably going to be a lot more variability in performance from vendor to vendor than we're used to, due to the sourcing of VRAM potentially being from different places.",Neutral
AMD,They have 92% of the gaming sector. It's easy money and a failsafe if the AI bubble goes bust.,Neutral
AMD,Nvidia is also likely in a position where can get better prices on memory than AMD. So they might not be facing reduced margins yet.,Neutral

AMD,"Why is it ok to talk about AMD rumors but not NVidia ones?  The seemingly official quote in this article is clearly at least partially wrong:  It states no new products through 2027.

AMD,"Nvidia has a 378 mm2 GPU that has a MSRP of $1000 and $750, while AMD for the same die size has $550 and $600 MSRP. In this case, nvidia makes between 50-80% more $$$ per die.  Nvidia has a 260 mm2 GPU has that a MSRP of $550, while AMD has a 200 mm2 for $300 and $350.  And so on....  A wafer of chips produced at TSMC generates nvidia much more money that AMD's one, even though the prices per wafer must be similar.",Neutral
AMD,"The 9070 XT is priced closer to an RTX 5070 right now, performs like a 5070 Ti but is much closer in terms of hardware to an RTX 5080.

AMD,"Certainly NVidia has notably higher margins here, but you're likely over estimating it somewhat.  GDDR6 and GDDR7 do not have the same cost.

Additionally, Its not clear how much of the actual sale (vs MSRP) NVIdia earns vs AMD -- there are various people making profit between them and the consumer.  We also know that NVidia sells the vast majority of its gaming GPUs not directly to consumers but to OEMs for pre-builds.

AMD,">GDDR6 and GDDR7 do not have the same cost. The overall board cost is also influenced by cooling and complexity of the board traces / power circuitry (though, not by that much).  Hope you're not trying to say that GDDR7 is responsible for the increase of $400 of board costs. Come on! A little research showed that there's just a difference of $2-3 per GB, which comes around **$30-50 for 16GB**. Please don't try to say the PCB circuitry is $300 because PCB's is one of the cheapest components of a GPU.  LE: You say the costs are influenced by cooling. FYI, the TDP increase for 5080 vs 9070 is just 45W (350W vs 304W). That's $10 **max** in cooler costs if you've been closely following the BOM cots for the industry.",Neutral
AMD,"That doesn't mean AMD isn't selling well, it can mean that Nvidia happens to sell even better. But mostly in the OEM and laptop market, not the DIY and enthusiast market that interest us.

AMD,"There's only one adapter that works reliably, the Cable Matters one. All other DP -> HDMI adapaters fail to pass through a 4K 120Hz HDR VRR 10 bit signal semi-reliably.  Other adapaters will be able to do the same specs, but not all at the same time. For instance, you'll have 4K 120Hz HDR, but VRR will not work. Or you'll have VRR but the HDR won't work. Or you'll have both, but the image will be 8 bit (HDMI 2.0 levels with 8 bit 4:2:0), causing colour issues. Or the image will straight up bug out/break/disconnect.  The Cable Matters is the only adapter the community has found which can do all the above somewhat reliably. The adapater is at its fucking limit, so sometimes it bugs out, needing to be unplugged/plugged in, or a restart; but in my experience I get 4K 120Hz HDR with VRR at 10bit most of the time. I use Bazzite on an LG C1 TV with an AMD 7900XT.  I would consider the experience absolutely usable and not a dealbreaker. It just works most of the time. I just have to unplug it and plug it back in, or restart my console PC under the TV a couple times a month.  Now we wouldn't need that adapter if the HDMI Forum allowed HDMI 2.1 on Linux without proprietary drivers (which AMD do not have). And unfortunately HDMI has a monopoly on TVs, so we're stuck with either HDMI 2.0 (which is open source on linux, but looks like shit with HDR and VRR enabled due to 8bit 4:2:0), or using a janky ass adapter to use HDMI's more reasonable competitor - Displayport.",Neutral

With the Adapter the LG 42C2 only shows ""VRR"" instead of ""Gsync"". And I activated ""Reference"" mode for colors in the new nvidia app, because HDR was a bit washed out at first.

AMD,"The open source Nvidia driver ""works"" because it is modular. The part that the HDMI Forum refuses to open source is separate and proprietary.  Intel Arc skips the problem entirely afaik by having the DP -> HDMI converter on board the card itself. Intel Arc cards don't actually have HDMI, just a converted Displayport.  So you could use Nvidia on Linux. But then you'd have to deal with the plethora of Nvidia-specific issues on Linux: lower FPS than Windows, bad frame times, low 1% lows, bad Wayland support, no Gamescope support, etc... It's usable and mostly works if you don't look at the numbers. But when a 9070XT catches up to a 5090 in averages on Linux, and beats it in 1% lows, you know something's wrong.  About your second point, sure it's ideological in the sense that AMD decided a decade ago to make their Linux drivers open source, and part of the Linux Kernel itself. (AMD users on Linux do not update drivers, they just update the Kernel. Nvidia users have to install separate drivers like Windows). And they're paying for that (otherwise good decision) today.  But the problem in reality is practical, because it means that AMD would have to rewrite their entire driver architecture for Linux because one pesky organisation refuses to give an inch.  It's absurd to blame AMD driver design which has always been the best Linux GPU experience, when it's one organisation refusing to budge an inch and asking AMD to reinvent the wheel instead. The worst part is the HDMI 2.1 firmware isn't black magic. There's no trademark secret here that risks being exposed; let alone capabilities which Displayport doesn't already have. They're litterally just being asses about it.",Neutral
AMD,"No it's NOT that straightforward. Nvidia and AMD have very different GPU architectures. Nvidia has the GSP which offloads a lot of hardware management from the OS, including apparently HDMI-related functionality. The GSP is essentially an entire sub-OS that runs on the GPU that is launched via firmware provided by the OS. This has several benefits such as being separated from the OS so that they can have the OS-specific driver side be simpler with a shared GSP firmware. It also can help reduce load on the system CPU since many tasks are being handled directly on the GPU instead of needing to run on the CPU. And also what is probably the most important reason to Nvidia that it allows them to ""lock"" features in a way where someone can't hack the driver to unlock them (their consumer GPUs basically have all the same hardware as their enterprise ones but the consumer ones have severe limits because they want companies to buy their more expensive ones). The con of it is that it makes the GPUs slightly more expensive (pennies compared to what they get by forcing companies to buy enterprise GPUs instead) and that the firmware blobs are very large because they're essentially an entire minimal OS image.  By contrast the AMD GPUs have much simpler firmware components and delegate much of what the GSP does to the driver. This is cheaper for them but it means that they have to write the functionality multiple times for the OSs they support and they have no real mechanism to prevent people from buying their cheaper consumer GPUs instead of their more expensive ones (besides the latter having more memory and being under a support contract).",Neutral
AMD,"Not quite sure of the full details, but essentially it boils down to NVIDIA doing things differently.  They have a closed source firmware blob that handles most low level card functionality unlike AMD and Intel, and thus they can offer HDMI 2.1 functionality by not having that functionality as part of the driver itself, but rather handled by the firmware.",Neutral

The OS kernel driver just tells the GSP what it wants to do and the GSP takes care of the implementation details. AMD and Intel can't do the same thing with their cards and it would require a complete rework of how the cards/GPUs are designed.

When we had significant amounts of VGA / DVI those basically never died even when they got beat up badly by the users. HDMI isn't quite on that level, but they mostly only die from users smooshing their PCs against the wall and bending the hell out of the cable ends. I replace a dead HDMI cable maybe once every couple months due to this.  Our DisplayPort cables never get beat up due to the PCs associated with them being under counters in a spot where users have no reason to move them around, but despite this they die like crazy. We replace maybe three or four a month. We've tried a variety of brands including Cable Matters, because we'd really like to stop dealing with this. No dice.",Negative

AMD,"Just because the Nvidia driver is offloading more tasks to the GPU it does not mean that it uses less CPU than the AMD GPU. It just means that the Nvidia driver would be using more CPU compared to not doing so, but at the end of the day the hardware is different and the drivers are completely different implementations. Perhaps the AMD driver is in fact more efficiently written than the Nvidia one or perhaps the Nvidia driver is doing something else that the AMD driver isn't.   Without actually profiling what the driver is doing while it's scheduled on the CPU you'd have no real way to know the reason and even if you had profiles of both the AMD and Nvidia drivers they'd be so different in terms of codepaths that it would be almost impossible to do a direct comparison.",Neutral
AMD,"It’s not a choice between ideology or pragmatism, rather simple technological constraints.  Fundamentally, AMD and Intel GPUs can’t use this approach, since NVIDIA has a CPU on their GPU since Turing allowing for them to create this more powerful firmware.

They could always make a closed source driver of course, but this would mean essentially maintaining a completely separate driver module out of the kernel, which would mean spending resources to ensure constant compatibility.",Neutral
AMD,"Audio via HDMI supports return channels, DP doesn't. HDMI also simply has a lot more investment going into it",Neutral

AMD,"Right, but that wouldn't preclude them from having possibly included a hardware converter like Intel did on ARC. They don't have to convince the hdmi forum if they ship a hardware implementation with the GPU just outputting DP signals.  Of course, all speculation until the final hardware is out",Neutral
AMD,"Generally speaking, no you can't put binary modules in kernel modules even if you want to, because they effectively become GPLv2 themselves when linked into the kernel.  Nvidia does some questionable things with their binary module to try to get around this by calling out to the binary from the kernel (which I've heard referred to as a ""legal prophylactic"" lol), but even this is questionable on whether it follows the licence text. Mainly, that hasn't been tested in court, and may or may not stand up to lawyering.  Firmware is a different story, since the kernel would generally be loading the firmware into the device to make it work, rather than that code being linked against the kernel. So, a future design from AMD could place the HDMI handling in the firmware module and work fine on Linux.  Copy protection, and security through obscurity are likely factors in why the HDMI forum is so shitty about this, but I think the bigger thing is the licensing revenue. If an open implementation exists, then it could be copied into an uncertified device, and the HDMI forum would have to buy one fewer exotic car or something.  As a counterpoint, DisplayPort does HDCP (copy protection) just fine without this draconian licensing issue, and is equivalent (or better than) hdmi 2.1 in features. The only drawback to it is lack of support from TV manufacturers.",Negative

AMD,Ugh why didn't they just come up with a dedicated audio connection instead.,Negative
AMD,there are multiple ways to expose an audio device over TB.  It is completely possible for a TB display to also act as a bridge so that it forwards all other attached TB device to the host (video source) meaning from the video source you can then select what audio output as it would show up just the same as if you attached that audio output directly to it.,Neutral
AMD,USB and PCIe are both standards that are channeled through TB.   A thunderbolt display can act as a TB/USB multiplexer so it exposes attached USB/PCIe devices to the upstream video source.   Thus letting any audio device attached to it be directly addressable from the video source.,Neutral

AMD,"If they have done that then this wouldn’t be an issue because they would just use the hardware converter, but seeing as it is an issue, then they don’t have a hardware converter in there, the older Intel Arc GPUs don’t have both a straight HDMI connection from the GPU and a converted HDMI, the ones that had converted HDMI *only* had converted HDMI.",Neutral
AMD,"Well but that is the fault of the licence the open source project has picked. It's an issue purely caused by the FOSS project themselves, the GPL is actually meant precisely to not allow such things. They ruled themselves out by their choice. It's kinda their responsibility to deal with it whichever way they want - to convince others to comply, to find some Nvidia-like workaround, or to not have the feature if they don't want to.  HDMI creators don't have to comply, open source projects aren't magically entitled to have everybody go out of their way to serve their needs.  WRT DisplayPort, it's complicated. In theory it looks better just for the reason it is free so devices could be cheaper/have more ports etc. But for example DP 2.x was years late, so HDMI 2.1 kind of earned its place as the high-bandwidht solution for over 4K60 resolutions. There are the audio and synchronization things. AFAIK HDMI is better at working over longer cables, which DP 2.x has big issues with (the 80Gbps mode). Sadly we can expect HDMI 2.2 with 96Gbps bandwidth to again come to market much sooner than the DisplayPort alternative (though arguably, 96Gbps is not that much higher than 80Gbps, so as long as DP 2.1 UHBR20 actually becomes commonplace, maybe the alternative is here already).  So you can't really say the HDMI does nothing to justify its premium.  I also hear repeat complains about DisplayPort monitors having annoying quirks when going to sleep (icons/windows rearranged iirc). No idea if the prevalence of such problems is really bigger than on HDMI, of course. I don't quite remember having issues with HDMI myself.",Negative

PCs would have also benefit from the optical cable solution.",Negative
AMD,"It'd be nice, but it would require a more powerful chip to exist - it's a pretty specialized thing, and you'd have a make back all of the money on designing and fabricating the chips (plus chip manufacturers are pretty slammed these days) and the only real use case I know of for these is for connecting TV to older GPUs or multiple TVs to GPUs with a single HDMI port.   I'd also have to see if you could draw enough power off of the power pin on the DP port to power anything significantly better  I don't really know, just throwing out some ideas of why they might not be gunning to do that right now",Neutral
AMD,"My point is we don't know yet, but we DO know they didn't do that on the Steam Deck.  It remains an issue for HDMI on Linux and AMD hardware either way, even if they do end up building in a workaround.  I hold more hope for that idea than Valve/AMD/anyone convincing the HDMI forum to stop being asshats about it though",Neutral
AMD,"Sure, the HDMI forum has that right and I have a right to call them assholes for it. They'll still be getting their licensing fees on the hardware either way, and it's doubtful HDCP would be any less secure because of an open implementation. Previous implementations have never been an issue in that regard.  There's also practical reasons why a closed source module is a bad idea. It becomes a debugging black box if there's ever an issue caused by that code.  I think the main thing with stuff rearranging on sleep is from the monitor appearing to be disconnected. I've seen the same thing happen with HDMI, but as with all things, your mileage may vary",Negative

AMD,"Because a simple TB/USB4 needs the support from the SOC maker and it would be a more expensive solution than just a display port input.  Display port should be able to walk with its legs, in order to star a transition (not a replacement because you still need HDMI support for a long time) it has to have the same feature as HDMI. It must have an eARC replacement, CEC etc.  HDMI is used because it has everything a TV needs and it's licensing cost are negligible.",Neutral
AMD,"What are you even talking about? You can't use the vast majority of the older cables with the latest bandwidth requirements. You end up with signal dropouts. And no I did not cheap out. It's just the reality that if you're taking years ago, the cables were only made to the specs required at the time.. It's like having a cable now that supports 48Gbps and in 10 more years you need a cable for 16K video or something (theoretical, obviously) and the best of the best cables of today probably wouldn't support 192Gbps or whatever the new bandwidth requirement is. We reached a point where the quality of the HDMI cable absolutely does matter now where years ago it did not because of far less bandwidth requirements.

They were also the owner of SD Card manufacturer Lexar, before they sold it to a company in China maybe 8-10 years ago. Same thought process, it was just even smaller of a piece of their business.

AMD,">This coupled with the recent shortages of RAM for consumers and subsequent rise in their prices has got me worried. If this trend continues and AI race actually takes off, where does that leave normal PC enthusiasts / DIY culture that started in 1980's. We can't assemble computers without RAM, SSDs or GPUs.  DIY PC pays by far the least for silicon of any market, so it eats last. You can expect DIY PC builds to not really be sensible for many quarters.   Regrettably, we are in the very early innings on this trend. Things will get a lot worse before they get better. The first sign that things are normalizing will be sensible pricing on OEM PC builds. They are able to make volume contracts than retail can't support.  >Plus, the recent thrust by both Intel and AMD to go for APU / integrated architecture makes me believe that the industry is pushing consumers towards locked hardware that cannot be customized, and we all would eventually be forced to use NUCs or laptops that come with soldered RAM and CPU or even worse, integrated SOC with GPU.  APUs make a lot more sense than low-end dGPU products. Making a dGPU requires a bunch of infrastructure components that add cost and size to the design. Those things make sense if you are building something big and powerful. If you are instead making a mainstream 1080p graphics solution, an integrated graphics solution with on-package memory is cheaper and better.  >Would love to know your views on how this thing will eventually play out. Do you think that this AI bubble will eventually pop bringing normalcy or can this bring out seismic shift in how we see computers?  ""The cure for high prices is high prices"". The memory market will eventually see either a new entrant or major new capacity coming online. However, a fab that broke ground today would have a hard time ramping to sufficient volume to change pricing before 2028. The existing players have a long track record of cartel behavior.

Micron NAND and DRAM is still going to make it's way to consumer DIY through commercial B2B sales to businesses like Kingston and Corsair, who will put it in RAM and SSDs sold to consumers.

Now they're discontinuing Crucial.   Hynix doesn't have a consumer DDR5 division. They have a limited consumer SSD division.

AMD,At least nowadays non-last gen hardware is more than enough for playing comfortably most games,Positive
AMD,"I think you're reading too much into that one event. Remember that Micron/Crucial ended their Ballistix branding with DDR5 three years ago. They never had much in the way of offerings in the DDR5 generation, and what die they had were the worst of the three DRAM manufacturers. Micron chips work best around 5200 and can range up to 5600, but any kits above that rating are utilizing extremely binned chips at high voltages. I don't know of any reason why Micron couldn't redesign their DRAM to be competitive, but they clearly chose not to. Even Samsung's memory clocks higher, though it doesn't clock anywhere close to SK Hynix chips nor can reach their timings.  It's worth pointing out the people who had the most trouble with memory on their DDR5 builds were more often than not using Micron or Samsung based kits. I'm sure the heavy returns hurt their financials. But you should realize that Micron's current DDR5 offering was about to be made moot. Intel already clocks over 7000, and AMD is going to (farking finally) launch its 2nd gen DDR5 controller that should move the bar well above the 6000 sweet spot. Not even OEMs are going to be buying 5200-5600 kits regardless of price, meaning without a die redesign the only space left to offload chips would be servers and that's what Micron is now doing.  The AI bubble will pop, money isn't infinite and spending billions to make a few million every quarter isn't sustainable. There is no magic market that will materialize to fill in that gap disparity. Short of creating a true AI that can act as a people replacement the AI bubble is going to pop... AI won't truly go away, we're stuck with it just like we're stuck with the internet. But we are very much in a bubble and it's hard to imagine a scenario where the hundreds of billions being blown on datacenter deployments won't end up with a massive overbuild of DCs that will cause multiple bankruptcies in the future. I used to think there would always be enough demand elsewhere to keep former-AI DC's in use, but we're quickly building past that level.  As for breaking up NVIDIA, I'm not sure how that'd be feasible, they design a single base tier uArch and then scale it across all market segments. Forking the company into a consumer-only GPU division would probably just create another Radeon situation where the company keeps prices high to amortize its dev costs across the consumer market, instead of across all of its markets.  Micron isn't going anywhere, they're just focusing exclusively on servers and enterprise where the margins are largest and product support is easiest. The other day I read that Micron is now going to build a $9.6 billion dollar HBM fab in Japan. It's unfortunate but not unexpected, all three HBM vendors have been selling out their entire annual HBM production 12-18 months in advance since 2023. If other DRAM vendors still existed they would've already jumped ship to chase those silly numbers too.  Maybe at some point in the future when there's a single vendor for some piece of the computer hardware the market might be at risk. But it seems unlikely, because OEMs buy consumer level hardware and in order to supply OEMs they have to produce the same parts consumers would buy regardless. In Micron's case the DRAM they're producing isn't even good enough to meet OEM's needs, let alone consumers.  Edit: Will say I've been corrected, Micron does make a newer gen die for DDR5 that tops out at 6400 in 16/24Gb flavors, and it's even available under their own branding. But it's sure not common and still suffers from high timings.",Negative

As for Micron, like someone else said I think exiting consumer memory has been on the cards for a long time now and this has just given them the perfect excuse to do it, AI bubble or not.

Obviously that affects NVIDIA's pricing too because they can only produce a limited amount while paying a lot for that too.   AI on top of that is causing even more issues because of the margin they shift the limited supply towards server GPU's which means even less space for lower pricing.

AMD,"Depends on price. Word on the street is that AMD gave Valve a reaaally good deal on 7600 dies.   Essentially it appears that AMD produced way too many Navi 33 dies, using an older node (6nm) to make them cheaper and more plentiful, expecting to put a lot of them in laptops. Apparently, OEMs preferred the more expensive (and more efficient) 4060 instead, and that left AMD with lots of Navi33 (RX 7600) dies on their hands.  Talking to AMD Valve probably saw an opportunity to take this excess capacity for cheap, and AMD saw an opportunity to recoup some cost, rather than risk throwing them away. I can imagine Valve getting those RX 7600 cards for maybe half the price of what a 9060XT would be (depending on memory prices).",Neutral

AMD,"It's Navi 33, but with 28CUs it's more like an [RX 7600M](https://www.amd.com/en/support/downloads/drivers.html/graphics/radeon-rx/radeon-rx-7000-series/amd-radeon-rx-7600m.html#amd_support_product_spec) than a [desktop RX 7600](https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/desktops/radeon/7000-series/amd-radeon-rx-7600.html)",Neutral
AMD,So the new Steam Machine is a PC McRib?,Neutral
AMD,"Someone on this platform tried to convince me that valve is willing to spend crazy r&d money on AMD to get a custom GPU solution akin to strix halo for the steam machine.  I told em valve is smart financially and will never do that and will just do the same exact thing as the steamdeck, pick an existing chip that AMD needs to dump off at an exceptional price. The 7600 system that's leaked will be what you see and what you get.  Well well it's almost as if that particular redditor does not have any business experience at all and valve is a multi billion dollar for multiple reasons including being financially smart.",Negative
AMD,"The issue is that 3060 performance with outdated upscaling, severe lack of machine learning capabilities meaning no FSR4, No FSR Redstone and very outdated RT capabilities is not exactly a great look for what will sell as a brand new machine in the year 2026.  It really needs to be priced very low to be competitive.",Negative
AMD,"i dont think its full fat navi 33   that is 32 CUs, this thing is 28 CUs  so its rejects on top of navi 33 rofl, IE 7600M/7400 class.  now, if that is fulfilled with actual salvage or cut down from fully functional that is another question.",Neutral
AMD,Made the most sense,Neutral
AMD,Sure if its a really good price it makes sense..,Positive
AMD,"And for this, I expect Steam Machine to be in a reasonable price range. It’s the same for both Machine and Frame, there are very clear signs of compromises for cost purposes that Valve didn’t take for something like Index. The whole product was planned with cost in mind and while I don’t expect a subsidized price, I don’t think it’s going to be too expensive.",Neutral
AMD,I too watch MLID 😆,Neutral
AMD,"They're still selling 6600 new. And for some reason, 7600 never dropped to 180$ like 6600 did now almost 2.5 years ago...",Neutral
AMD,of course they did. They would have to throw away the 7600m dies otherwise because noone wanted them.,Negative
AMD,Eh. I'm betting on $600 for the entry level version and $750 for the 2TB version.,Neutral
AMD,"How is this even possible. The individual components today cost more than $500, not to mention the 2TB option will be easily more expensive than it was when the Steam Machine was first announced.",Negative
AMD,The fact that they’re using salvaged Navis means they’re selling jack shit 7600m dies. Which is to nobody’s surprise given how few laptops exist with 7600m. Oems do not want amd dgpus on their laptops.,Negative
AMD,This would make the SM $100 extra and for sure the CPU would have been a bottleneck for this card.,Neutral
AMD,Why?   This is a 1080p card.   8GB is sufficient for its performance.,Neutral
AMD,think thats why they did the rx 7600M,Neutral
AMD,"That's true. OEMs actually want this at least a little, unlike the old 7600m",Neutral
AMD,"Exactly. AMD apparently printed lots of mobile 7600 dies, and sold jack shit. So now they are trying to get rid of them",Negative

AMD,They never said it used an APU.,Neutral
AMD,Kek Strix Halo is expensive AF. And if would be RDNA3(.5),Negative
AMD,"I saw an interesting video yesterday where the guy tested a Steam Machine-like config (6 cores, RX7600) to see how it performed and yeah... not good when RT involved at advertised 4k, Indiana Jones was unplayable.  Even non-RT loads required very low settings.  New games are going to really test that hardware, I think RT is a total non starter on it as well.",Negative
AMD,Exactly.  I wouldnt consider a 3060 useable without dlss working wonders.  Especially at 4k where you need dlss performance or ultra performance.  Trying to do that without a proper upscaler is going to produce hideous results.,Neutral
AMD,"$1000 also isn't a great look for a console killer. Between Sony releasing the PS5 Pro at a really steep price ($750/€800), both Microsoft jacking up the Xbox Series price (X for $650) and Sony doing the same (PS5 for $550) and Nintendo charging quite a bit more for the Switch 2 ($450) I'd say there's an opening here for a Steam Machine to enter the console market.  If Valve can release something that can compete with these consoles, at a similar price, with a similar feature set, but with also all the advantages of being a computer, then it's definitely worth it. Going from $1000 to $700 will open a huge market for Valve. Going to $600 would be the nail in the coffin for Xbox.   No online fees, lower game prices, your game library will never expire, infinite game catalogue, and you can use it as your main PC as well, for the same price as a normal console... Not a bad sales pitch.  BTW, lots of people are using a Steam Deck as their main console. If millions are happy with Deck performance, this is more than enough. If you want better, build your own, unlike with classic consoles, you can easily do it now.",Neutral
AMD,I doubt there are enough defective ones to be all salvaged. It'll be like the consoles where they're cut back to ensure as many dies can be used as possible,Negative
AMD,"I'm hoping $600, unless RAM prices fuck it all up and it becomes $700-800",Negative
AMD,Valve isn’t buying individual components at retail price.,Neutral
AMD,More and more games demand RT and even software RT is vram heavy. Doom the dark ages can run much better on the 7600xt compared to its 8gb version even though they're the same card with only mild clock differences,Neutral
AMD,"If the 9060XT can utilize 16GB, so can a 9060. The performance difference is imperceptible without a framerate counter.",Neutral
AMD,"Plus, much easier to integrate into a smaller form factor than shrinking down a desktop GPU. The Steam machine is basically a screen-less laptop hosting a Ryzen 7640 (without iGPU) plus an RX 7600M, but with a huge-ass heatsink and fan to properly allow for higher clocks.",Positive
AMD,It's honestly hilarious. AMD will have zero FSR4 compatible mobile product at all until 2027 without hacky aftermarket solutions. Mind you laptop sales began to outpace desktop about two decades ago.,Negative
AMD,Remember KFConsole,Neutral
AMD,"Some people are just that delusional, best case scenario AMD gives valve extremely faulty strix halo chips that are cut down by more than 50%. That individual straight up said it will be fully custom.",Negative
AMD,"Except it's not even a desktop 7600, it's a mobile 7600m. Another 4CU cut.",Negative
AMD,"I think this thing makes no sense at all.  Especially since you re not just buying a new low end gpu to put into an old pc for cheap to give it some new life.  No , you re buying cpu, gpu, ram, ssd, mobo, case, power supply  Thats a ton of money.  And the performance wont justify the price at all.",Negative
AMD,"The 4k claim is really weird. On old games, sure. But am 8GB 7600 is a 1080p GPU, which isn't even that bad on a TV, especially since upscaling 1080p content is kind of a TV's bread and butter",Negative
AMD,"599 is ideal but I’d tolerate 699. Speaking of the RAM shortage, I get reminded of how Valve launched Steam Deck during the worst of COVID shortage, so I am somewhat hopeful",Negative
AMD,"Cool, but individual components involve free assembly by you, steam machine needs assembling and to make money.",Neutral
AMD,"Slapping the chip from the RX 9060/XT onto a laptop style motherboard would not be technically any more difficult than using the 7600M chip. The 7600M is itself just a slightly cutdown, underclocked desktop RX 7600 chip.  Both chips are physically pretty much the same size (200 mm2 give or take a few) and the desktop versions have very similar power usage.   The only reason to use the RX 7600 over the RX 9060 chip in this application is cost.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah he mentioned that... result will be worse. 4K60 is going to be a very limited thing, marketing beware etc but I hope people are prepared for a little/lot of choppiness.",Negative
AMD,"Because of frame gen and upscaling, they can say it’s any output resolution any output frame rate and it’s technically not lying. It’s a useless piece of info without details.",Negative
AMD,"The steam machine doesn’t need to make money. The steam machine needs to get people to play PC games, which steam has an effective monopoly on. If Valve sells the steam machine at cost they’ll make money.",Neutral
AMD,"I agree, but it's still more work than just slapping the existing laptop board that's already engineered with the proper footprint, connections, inputs and outputs in there, because AFAIK there's no RDNA4 laptop parts at all and the most we have are the RDNA3.5 GPU in the PS5 Pro and the AI APUs",Negative
AMD,Any corporate mention of resolution and framerate is completely meaningless now because it only refers the output. It could be achieved by upscaling from 540p and with 4x frame gen (amd doesn't use it atm) and it still wouldn't be technically lying.,Negative
AMD,Frame gen and upscaling can't solve a lack of VRAM in many games either though (frame gen makes it even worse). Unless they're talking about FSR1 lol,Negative
AMD,"Yes it does, it can't be loss leader because otherwise people will just buy it for office use. They said it themselves.",Neutral
AMD,"Who is buying a steamOS machine for office use? Which office is going to bother buying this instead of any of the hundreds or thousands of offerings from T1 SIs that actually provide support and service? This thing doesn’t even use standard components, are you even going to get official drivers on Windows?",Negative
AMD,"They promoted the steam machine as being able to install other OS. If they don't support it then I suppose at least it would be really funny for how much people glazed them for it.   There will be companies buying it if it's cost effective due to valve eating costs. Hell, even if they don't, valve just have no control over it's userbase, it could have a really low acquisition rate from non steam users, just like steam deck, so all that loss leading would be for nothing.  If you are right then it's a pc, that you can't upgrade, that can't play hugely popular games like league of legends, GTA, battlefield or valorant. Device designed not for casuals and not for enthusiast. Just people who are okay with paying a lot of money to play old, locked in time, singleplayer games on TV. It has to support windows.",Neutral
AMD,"No sizable company is buying a ton of computers to replace the OS on them, especially not for this level of hardware. No normal user is buying a Steam Machine running SteamOS from Steam because they really want a Linux desktop.  The problem with charging a PC price instead of a console price is that it’s just worse than an actual gaming PC. Even with all the advances Valve has made to Linux gaming you still can’t play a lot of popular multiplayer titles, and hardware wise it’s essentially a 5-year old console. There’s just no justification to pay more than $500-600 for one of these.",Negative

AMD,"The 5070 is pretty good value tbf. It's a little weaker than a 9070, but also sells well below MSRP, which results in similar price/perf. It's also more common in prebuilts. It's also a really big step over the 5060 Ti 16GB (which sells at MSRP) for only a small price difference.  The uninformed buyer gets a 9060XT, 5060, 5060Ti or 5070 prebuilt. As a result the 5070 gets decent market share.  Even as a pc builder myself, the 5070 is appealing in the Swedish market, and if I were in the market for a GPU right now, I'd definitely consider it. It's about 1500 sek/160$ cheaper than the 9070 right now, or 2000SEK/215$ cheaper than a 9070 XT. (5190 SEK vs \~6700 SEK vs \~7200 SEK, or \~550 USD vs \~710 USD vs \~765 USD)",Positive

People KNOW they're not getting a 4090, but I think it is still a viable upgrade for many people for $550 ($450 or less for black Friday). Seeing that the average is a 3060, you're essentially doubling performance or more.  My biggest gripe with the GPU was the 12GB (should have been 16GB). Games like Spiderman 2 hit that limit with ray tracing even at 1080p without DLSS. I felt like I was paying a lot for a card that was obsolete out of the box. Otherwise it was crushing everything I was throwing at it.",Neutral

AMD,"I mean it takes one second to check Amazon or any other major retailer, after which you will see that the 9000 series is selling really well compared to prior generations. 9000 series GPUs are straight up the most popular for DIY systems in several countries, especially outside the US, where Nvidia prices are especially high.  You could also look at AMD gaming revenue in order to make the same conclusion. 9000 series is selling well. It's not Nvidia numbers, but the cards are certainly moving in decent volume compared to the RDNA 3 flop.  Another anecdote is that system integrators seem to be putting more AMD cards in their systems than they used to, likely because the 9060XT is better value than 5060 Ti.

AMD,Look at the Linux numbers. It’s overwhelmingly amd.   I do legit think there is a bug in collection on windows.  Not just amd cards but also nvidia newer cards due to a bug many of us think is happening on amd CPUs with an apu enabled. A lot of people are favoring x3d for gaming builds and the data looks weird there.   I have two desktops: a windows box with 265k and 6900xt and a Linux box with a ryzen 7900 and 9060xt. My wife has a 5900x with 7900xt and a 3700x with a nvidia 960 on Linux.   Steam last took surveys from my systems around June. That was before I got the 265k and 9060xt. (Had a 14700k in windows and arc a750 in Linux) my wife hasn’t had a survey since before she got the 7900xt last year.   I expect nvidia to win as well as Intel on cpu due to Internet cafes in Asia along with trends there on purchases but I still feel like amd and nvidia should have more share on their newer gpus.   Sometimes I wish valve did more breakdowns like what the specs are on systems with current gen CPUs and gpus. (Most popular current builds)  also builds by region.  I except a slam dunk for Intel and nvidia in Asia.  I would expect stronger market for amd in Germany and the US in part because of the Linux numbers,Negative

Ryzen is DEFINITELY going to get a majority sometime 2026, no way it isn't happening especially if Zen 6 comes that apparently will be on a new node with 12 core CCDs it'll be a good generational upgrade itself, Intel really won't be able to catch up, maybe keep up from falling behind worse but yeah AMD has the leadership right now in new CPUs. Zen 5 is already significantly faster in gaming and Zen 6 is going to extend it well over Zen 5, vs Zen 4 to 5 where it was Zen 5% and Intel Core Ultra flopping with less gaming perf and still less efficiency along with then recent problems with previous generations made Intel miss their opportunity hard.",Negative

AMD,"Again.  The survey shows higher increase for the 7600XT than the entire 9000 series combined from march until now. It also shows the 7800 XT share increasing more in november alone (+0.13%)  than any 9000 series card over its entire lifetime (none crack 0.15%). It does not track with sales data whatsoever.  AMD representation is prebuilts was always very low, but has vastly increased due to the undeniably great value of the 9060XT. The 7600XT was a very poor seller, especially in prebuilts, which tend to go for cheaper options, since it was much more expensive than the 7600 and only offered extra VRAM.  Even more absurdly. The representation of the 7800XT in the Steam survey in has grown more in November alone (+0.13%) than the overall market share of any single 9000 series card. (none crack the 0.15% number to make it onto the list). Do you genuinely believe the 7800 XT sold more in november alone than any 9000 series card has since release?  It does not compute. It probably just registers the integrated graphics on the CPU or nothing at all for the GPU. I suspect that Valve just rejects DxDiag data from GPUs that have not been added to the list. I suspect they just haven't gotten around to adding the RDNA 4 cards there due to the change in naming scheme, while the 5000 series was added before release, since the naming scheme was consistent.  It clearly shows decent market share on Linux, which is admittedly likely to be inflated due to Nvidia drivers being pretty bad on Linux.

Regular 7600 that came out long before 7600XT does not show up at all BTW, despite usually being 50% cheaper than XT version and not having proper competition, totally normal. 7800XT was not great value during that time either, 5060TI 16GB is priced closely and generally even cheaper than 7800XT, for 10% more performance very few people will pick last gen AMD card.   > After which they (7800xt and 7600xt) were pretty nicely priced, while all new gen cards sat way above MSRP.

AMD,"This has always been the way of things. The problem with Ryzen's chiplet design is that latency between cores, IO die, and devices is unusually poor, which you'll see the effects of in latency-sensitive tasks, which includes your rapid random IO to and from SSDs.  In terms of a fix, you can probably claw back some performance by disabling some power saving features and clocking IF as high as it will safely go, but it's an inherently poor architecture for that sort of workload, and you can't really tweak and configure your way around that.",Negative

AMD,They can improve it with better packaging and stuff like glass substrates. Hopefully completely with advanced silicon to silicon bonding especially as node improvements slow,Positive
AMD,"Yep, and same SSD problem was reported with Arrow lake because it switched to tiles. Chiplets are pretty much a failure for consumer products.

AMD,"I'm not sure why I only see people talk about it now, but it's been always the case, ever since first gen Ryzen. Random read has been higher on Intel platforms. Subjectively, they also are more trouble-free.

AMD,Qualcomm is making consumer only chips that are cheap too. Snapdragon x plus was cheaper than lunar lake while still matching in battery life,Positive
AMD,"The problem that transferring data between SSD halted is probably due to AM5 only has PCIE 4x4 connecting the chipset and CPU. Assuming you have one SSD connecting directly to CPU and one connecting to the chipset, if both SSD are PCIE 4x4, it would easily eat up all the bandwidth.",Neutral
AMD,"If this is software issue, there is software fix. It is also something worth to check.",Neutral
AMD,"Thanks, I suspected this to be the case too, but the behavior is surprisingly undesirable if this were the case. Things are all good until too much data is transferred at a time, where the transfer speeds tank to literally 100-200MB/s between two PCIe 4x4 drives.   This can be easily induced with multiple data transfers happening at the time, but it's not limited to those scenarios. I can plug in a SATA drive to have the third disk drive transferring files to either of the existing two, or start large downloads writing to one of my disks, and the system will be paralyzed with sub 100MB/s transfer speeds across all devices combined.  My mobo's front drive slot is actually PCIe 5 connected to the CPU, and the secondary one is PCIe 4 connected to the chipset, so the hardware should theoretically easily accept faster drives.  While seeking support, I was told it is expected behavior due to IO bottlenecks that aren't restricted by pure bandwidth, but the logic queueing the requests that can get overwhelmed.  The same drives worked far more consistently on a Kaby Lake PCIe 3 mobo.",Negative
AMD,"Would you see that ""over time"" though? I'd have thought you'd see it pretty much immediately.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, but likely at the kernel level. Or maybe firmware, or an interaction between both.",Neutral
AMD,At some point you quickly saturate the DRAM buffering the QLC as well.  Its 12000KB per second... for the first .01 second.,Neutral
AMD,I’m not exactly sure what “over time” means here.,Neutral
AMD,"I'm quoting from the post you replied to. To me, ""over time"" implies initial transfer performance is great, but then tails off.  I can't see a PCIe bottleneck causing that kind of behaviour. Thinking about it, I wonder if they're seeing SLC caches being exhausted if the copies are large enough?",Neutral
AMD,"Thanks for inquiring! By ""over time"" I mean that my transfers can be neat multiple GB per second, and then fall. But the most consistent way of reproducing the issue is by adding additional IO operations (say, also copy to a SATA SSD, or initiate a couple of file downloads) the speeds fall to a fraction of that. They get massacred when I use Opera and enable parallel downloading (which basically downloads each file in bits in parallell), where I can get sub 100MB/s transfers across all disks.",Neutral

AMD,"Well, mobile ai, these things don’t use sodim ram (or ram sticks in general) and the speeds of ddr5x aren’t used for most CPU’s. This very well could be also targeting mobile ai ( specifically more ai/gaming where the 395+ was targeting development and simulations as well). Also ai doesn’t need cuda, rocm exists and it’s quite good, any downfalls of amd is on a architectural level, but if you’re doing local ai on the go then you don’t really need cuda if that makes sense.",Neutral

AMD,"Yes, but this is the version with the best GPU with the least cores, so it becomes the best for handhelds",Positive
AMD,"From a power point of view disabled-by-binning cores would be exactly the same as if you disabled them in the OS, or just didn't have enough work for the OS to schedule threads on them.  Any real savings would require a new die (and there may well be possible savings there, less complex busses, easier routing, fewer ports on sram blocks etc - but I suspect they might be relatively small), but this isn't that.  The *only* advantage this would have over the ""full fat"" die is cost. And that still depends on yields and how much supply of these binned dies they actually get.",Neutral

The thing is that Strix Halo doesn't make a lot of sense in laptops because it's expensive and for the same money you can get a laptop that's much more performant.  The only advantage for Strix Halo in laptop form is AI, and that's a niche market. So there's no point in laptop manufacturers in investing a platform that won't sale. It's simple logic.",Negative

AMD,Yes. Get a 5800xt. Or a used 5800x/5700x. It's your best option unless you want to pay premium for a Zen 3 X3D chip.,Neutral
AMD,5700x is a substantial upgrade from 3700x.  Of course 5700x3D is better in games but twice the price.,Positive
AMD,"I have a similarly powered build. Not exactly matching, but roughly similar weight class, anyway.  3600XT CPU  5700XT GPU  32GB 3600mHz RAM  2TB 980 Pro  Honestly, I might do what you're thinking of and upgrade to a maxed out AM4 and wait for AM6 or 7. I don't want to wait for RAM prices to go down to build a whole new computer. I think you should go ahead and upgrade your current rig.",Neutral
AMD,"5800x + 9070 will be your best budget bet...but that 550W psu is stretching it a little. Also check if its modular and actually has the correct cables for a new card.  I run a 5700x3d / 5070ti (3x8pin power) on a 750W just fine so you might be ok, but check with the GPU specifications.  If you upgrade your PSU & budget, your options will stretch your AM4's longevity somewhat.",Neutral
AMD,"RTX 5060 Ti (16GB VRAM ideally). This is non-negotiable for your LLM goal. Ryzen 7 5700X is likely your best bet if you want to avoid the X3D price/cache-only focus but still want a huge performance jump. If you pair the RTX 5060 Ti with the Ryzen 7 5700X, you have a much better shot at running the whole rig safely on your 550W PSU.",Positive

AMD,I have the B850 version of this board and it’s pretty solid. as far as I can tell the B650E and B850 versions of this board are identical. definitely a good deal,Positive
AMD,My budget would probably be around 200-250. My case I feel like is a pretty decent size but I don't need something massive. And features would probably have to be a decent amount of USB slots since I used a lot of those on my current mobo as well as ease of use in the BIOS since I know I'll probably have to update that,Neutral

AMD,"I have similar system except the GPU, which is a 6800XT (>5% difference XD) and the RAM, which is 3600MHz for me, I'm waiting out AM6 and the next gen cards, had no problem with any game (even new ones) at 1440p tho I was forced to the use of FSR, speaking of FSR, I still have hope that we get a better version than 3.1 for older cards too.....",Positive
AMD,I think you will be fine for a while yet.,Positive
AMD,"Not really, more thinking how long it will last with newer games since it feels like with each new game release the spec requirements are higher and higher. Like when will I have to update or change to ddr5.",Neutral
AMD,"Depends entirely on what games you want to play in the future, how well they are optimized, and how low you're willing to drop your settings. If you don't demand the very best, then you'll be fine for years.   Also you can't upgrade just to DDR5, it will require a new CPU and motherboard.",Neutral
AMD,You aren't actually replacing a GPU.  You are installing one into a system that doesn't have a GPU.,Neutral
AMD,The 5600GT is a CPU. The RTX 3060 is a GPU.  What exactly are you trying to do?  You can link photos from a hosting site like imgur.,Neutral
AMD,"I'm aware but looking at my specs there is no graphics card listed anywhere, all it says is AMD Ryzen 5600gt with Radeon Graphics. And looking inside my PC the areas where you plug into the graphics card are directly connected to the motherboard rather than a graphics card",Neutral
AMD,"The 5600GT has integrated graphics.  All you need to do is install the new GPU, connect your monitor to it, then install the Nvidia drivers.",Neutral
AMD,"The CPU has a shitty little GPU inside of it. If you want a GPU, you need to make sure your PSU can power it properly.",Neutral
AMD,That's good to know but the monitor connection thing connects directly into the motherboard. Is that gonna be an issue?,Neutral
AMD,> monitor connection thing  The video port? Like HDMI or Displayport?   You'll use the ports on the RTX 3060 instead.,Neutral

AMD,"These were my 2 options as well, I decided to go with the 5060 ti, yes the 5060 ti is usually a bit more expensive for just a bit more performance but in my opinion I feel like the 5060 will be more reliable in the future, with the dlss etc. both are great cards, and I think because your on the am4 the difference between each one won’t really matter, just buy the one which is the best price at the moment",Positive
AMD,"Get a 5700x3d put one in my brothers PC it's a beast, and the b580 is quite competitive if your rocking pcie 4.0",Positive
AMD,RDNA 4 is better than DLSS at the moment so take that what you will if you want to play at high resolutions.,Positive
AMD,"atm the difference in prices between 5060 ti (450€ + ) and rx 9060XT (387-400€)    I also really enjoy the nvidia interface, control panel and im generally used to nvidia but they're expensive as f...",Positive

AMD,"> I also really enjoy the nvidia interface, control panel  lol thats like the 1 place where nvidia gets trounced",Positive
AMD,"If that’s the case then the 5060ti may be the better option for you, the GPU might be with you for a long time so if you ever decide to upgrade to am5 take that into account as well. Paying a bit more for the 5060ti might not sound as bad in the long term",Positive
AMD,Sorry! That stinks,Negative
AMD,"I'm sorry, guess I'm out of the game of things. I bought it pre tarrifs on AliExpress for cheap. Runs great wish x3d was cheaper currently.",Positive
AMD,"Personally, neither. WoW appears to be sensitive to L3 cache amount (esp seeing how much improvement it has with X3D chips), so you want to avoid 5500 and 8400F as they both have halved L3 cache vs. other chips like 5600 and 7500F.  Try to get a PC with 7500F / 7600(X) / 9600(X) in it.",Neutral
AMD,"However much I'm not a fan of the 8000 series it is a good value   Go for the 8400f build though I would encourage you to spend a little more and get the 9060xt 16gb since it will hold up slot better in the long term.  Ram is stupid expensive right now.   Although the 8400f especially will benefit from better ram, i think if it's a big enough saving, go for some cheap 5200-5600mhz cl36-40 instead.",Neutral
AMD,I'm guessing the 7700 with 32gb ddr5 would be much better?  I'm helping my little brother get a new gaming computer and he said he can wait another pay period which would increase his budget by $200,Positive
AMD,"7700 is a fine choice too, but if you can stretch the budget a little more, I'd focus more on getting a PC with CPU I listed above, and upgrade the GPU to something like RX 9060 XT 16 GB.",Positive
AMD,"Since he seems a bit price sensitive, I'd look at the 7600x instead which is often the same price as the 7500f but a little faster.  There's kind of a large jump in games due to the cache, then it's smaller due to the clock frequency.        The extra cores won't help WoW much unless he's doing a lot of stuff in the background.",Neutral
AMD,"The computer I initially told him to get actually had the components listed below, but was around $350 out his budget. The specs are pretty much what you advised. I'll go back to pushing him towards that one! Thank you!   GeForce 9060XT 16gb 32gb DDR5 6000mhz Ryzen 5 9600X 1tb SSD",Positive
AMD,"But going straight to a 7800x3D shouldn't actually be that expensive - at least here for me it only costs €60 more than the 7700 (current offers included, otherwise €90-110 - then it would be smarter and more economical to get it straight away if that's the case :)  Just as an option, unfortunately it's different in every country and it's not worth it :)",Negative
AMD,"I'd say about 95% of what he plays on pc is World of Warcraft. Everything else he prefers on the Xbox. He also almost exclusively plays Classic over retail, if that makes much of a difference. He does raid, but not often.  His current budget is $850, but said he could make it $1050 on his first February check.  Thanks for the advice! I'll mark the 7600x on the possible list.  So for WoW the preference is a faster over a CPU with more cores? Is 16gb vs 32gb very important in WoW?",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, getting Radeon RX 9060 XT 16 GB / GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB will also be able to play more demanding (esp VRAM heavy) games if he wants to play them, perfect for 1080p gaming (and even some 1440p gaming).  His last goal afterward would be (if he still plays WoW in about 2\~3 years time) to upgrade his CPU to an final AM5 X3D chip about 2\~3 years later-- and this will provide insane performance uplift for WoW specifically.",Positive
AMD,"If they only play one game, it can make a difference as you can optimize a build just for that game.  Some games are more CPU demanding vs GPU demanding.  WoW is fairly CPU and cache sensitive, so you're better off shifting your budget from GPU to CPU on it.  As a good rule of thumb, the older the game the fewer cores are needed.  A quick search shows WoW uses up to 4 cores so you still have 2 cores mostly doing nothing or background tasks.  The 7700x would still be faster, it's just a minor bump and the money isn't worth it.  As far as I can tell you can get by with an 8GB card if all he likes to play WoW with low settings, but 16GB would be better if he likes high settings and definitely will age better if the PC will be used for many years into the future.",Neutral
AMD,"Sweet, that's what we will shoot for! I thank you very much for the advice. :) !2  He buys a new pre-built every 2-3 years, so won't have to worry about the last part. He gives the old one to our youngest brother every time.",Positive
AMD,"Just get the cheapest 9060 XT 16gb model. The difference between the 2 is at most 10%. They are also both about 50% faster than a 3060, can't go wrong.",Positive
AMD,that is not true there are plenty of scenarios where the 5060 ti is 30+ percent faster than the 9060 xt and plenty of situations where the 9060 xt is 20+ percent ahead of the 5060 ti for example in arc raiders the 5060 ti is 40+ percent faster than the 9060 xt and is AC shadows the 9060 xt is 20+ percent faster than the 5060 ti,Neutral

AMD,"Long explanation:  1.1. First I downloaded Adrenalin from official site (25.11.1) + GPU Tweak III from Asus. At first there was no problem that I could identife (I'm no pro user and learning everything by myself like many of us) Only that my fans in GPU Tweak III were stuck on 30% and there was nothing I could do. Later Installed MSI afterburner and problem gone. First game that I Opened was Dispatch. (Not the best game for testing but... my old pc has issues with UE4 for some reason). Everything worked fine, like what there is to not work in prerendered ""game"". Nontheless it is information. CPU GPU Usage was almost none if we compare stats with freststarted pc.  1.2. Outer wild was working fine.   2.0. Then there was minecraft (neoforge 1.20.4) with distant horizons and shaders (separated)  2.1. Minecraft with distant horizons and 60 fps lock showed me was working fine. 32 chunks + 100 Distant Horizons + Max CPU usage (5/5) + Quality of render (5/5). While it was redering, CPU temps were between 60-80C. When i stoped flying like a manic and started walking temps dropped to 40-55C. No Crashes, No Lags.  2.2. Minecraft with shaders (without distant horizons) - Complementary Shaders Unbound, all maxed out + 32 chunks. There were some lag spikes but only while rendering those chunks ('cause it's minecraft) but after that there were no trouble. Stable 60 fps, temp between 40-50C with no active fans.   3.0 After that windows decided that it is time to make some shitty unnecessary updates (still figuring how to turn them off, would've like a helping hand in that matter too).    After the ""update"" :  3.1. Adrenalin wasn't working at all  3.2. GPU Tweak (was still using it in this moment) was closing itself every 5 minutes or so.   3.3. So I did what every ""wanabe pc master race"" would do. I used my knowledge of task manager, device Manager and Programs and Features. Closed/Deleted manualy everything that was connected to drivers, reboot, reinstall. Everything ""worked"" again, Tweak was still stack at 30% fan but adrenalin worked fine. At that moment I should say that when I opened device manager I saw that several drivers was in yellow ! triangle. 1 PCI controller + AMD Streaming Audio Device + Other devices(Unkown Device + network controller). After drivers reinstallation those errors in device manager were still there. I thing other devices is xbox 360 wireless adapter but for now I cannot confirm it. (For now after everything I did later that day, PCI controller gone, but other still there)   4. Tried opening blender for the first time and it crashed with OpenGL 4.6 error. Open Adrenalin, setting, and saw that after reistallation i didn't have anything related to OpenGl, ""-"" all that i saw. Nice. Another reinstallation then. Reboot. Now blender works.",Neutral
AMD,"5.0. Next step was Space Marine 2. Downloaded, boot it up and it runs like shit. Even menu lags. Went to setting, checked GPU that the game was using: ""Radeon Graphics"". So, the problem was that the game could boot up, but i didn't saw $981,68 GPU (Yeah, pricing in my country is shit, almost $1k for GPU and there no better deal, only downgrading). The frustration was building up, but okay, let's try fixing it.  Several hours of deleting/reistalling drivers, googling, serfing in reddit, reading different opinions and experiences with same builds and how other were shitting on amd drivers, in that moment downloaded MSI Afterburner and installed older version of adrenalin (25.9.2). Tried booting up Space Marine 2. The Joy, the hope when I saw that game started smoothly, different tabs of adrenalin software poped up while booting, something related to FSR 4, ""Press ALT+R for more"" yada yada. Didn't even saw start menu, crashed. The frustration was building up. Too salt the wound, for some reason MSI Afterburner now didn't show me any GPU data and was not registering anything except the fact that there is GPU. No fan controll, no power usage %, nothing.  5.1. Installed newest drivers (25.11.1) - MSI Afterburner work again, Space marine 2 still wasn't seeing GPU.  5.2. Deactivated intergrated graphics, SM2 now won't boot up at all, crash from the start.  5.3. First time using DDU to uninstall drivers, using it without safe mode but deactivated connection to network so windows wouldn't download any drivers on it's own. Reboot. Installed Adrenalin (25.9.1). Reboot. Reinstalled MSI Afterburner. Reboot. Warhammer still crashes while suggesting me to report the issue. Msi Afterburner working for some reason. Boot up SM2, ALT+R for adrenalin menu, disabling everything modern AI setting and other stuff and forcing game to run at 60 FPS. Crashes. Googling. Finding out about power limit in MSI afterburner, Changing Power Limit from 0 to -30%. Boot up the game. IT'S RUNS. IT'S WORKING. Turned everything to ultra, CPU 60-70C, GPU 50-55C, 60 FPS STABLE. No lag spikes, no artifacts, nothing. I DID IT, YES.  Tried game. 5 mins, changes audio language to english. Crash. Reboot. Everything works, 1 hour playing not for the enjoyment, but for testing. Exit. Changed Power limit back to 0%, everything still works. wtf. It was not booting up before with 0% power usage, but now it is. Small Victory, but not the happy one. Sitting in old drivers with everything that cards offers in OFF state. But I need to test something more.   6. Booting up RDR2, not even saw black screen, it didn't start at all. Long story short, DDU with safe boot didn't help, older versions (25.3.1 didn't boot even adrenalin, 25.5.1 rdr2 didn't work, 25.6.1 didn't work)  7. Cyberpunk 2077, same, Crash without booting.  8.0. Then I thought, and downloaded PEAK, steam asked what I prefer, vulkan, dx11, dx12.  8.1. VUlkan work fine  8.2. DX11 Works fine  8.3. DX12 Game crashes instantly.  The frustration now was at PEAK (get it?)   And there I was, whole weekend wasted on troubleshooting and all I get is the reason why nothing works, but not how to fix it.   No human shall endure that kind of torture in my opinion, made some comments in different posts that suggests using DDU again but nah, this will be waste of time.",Negative
AMD,"What's next? 1. Next step for me is install clear windows and before everything istall GPU drivers while offline. 2. If that will not work, someone suggested tweaking some setting in BIOS, but from what I saw there is no EXPO ON, no PBO on, NO any other option on that seems shady. 3. If that will not work, someone suggested updating Motherboard BIOS, which I don't know how to do correctly and i'm shitting my pants thinking about it. +It sounds so stupid for me 'cause i never in my 25+ years of gaming updated bios on old pc, and now i need to updated it on PC part that not even 1 year old? Motherboard is newer than any part from the build. CPU 2023, GPU Q1 2025, Motherboard Mid2025. And you wanna say that issue is that manufacturer didn't give a shit about optimization and tests and now it's user problem to make everything work together? in 2018 I just builded pc and starter playing, but now in AI age I have feeling that half the work (if not more) done by AI and no one checks for anything.  While I didn't solved my problem for now, I still have hopes. Plus I hope someone will find my troubled joureny helpfull for themselfs, or help me, ehehe. In worst case I can return PC and refund some details like GPU and Motherboard to change them to others parts, thx for $100 i left specially for case like this. (in case of GPU: rx 9070 xt -> rtx 5070 ti, wich will cost me $200 more +newer case 'cause 5070ti is 2 cm bigger)   I'll keep here posting about everything, and once again, any help helps. Thx.   Q/A:  Is it pre-build?  Short answer no. Long: I bought details in my retail and it was build by worker of said retail, BUT NOT TESTED IN ANY SOFTWARE, it is not pre-build in that term. I could've build it myself, but i rather leave $100 for $2k build than trying to convine stuff of said retail that it's not me that broke pc part but rather it was already broken (happend before several times + worked there and know their policy). So they build it, run to BIOS and i took it home.   60hz monitor?  In future planning to take 144 hz 2k monitor, but now i'm out of cash.   Reason for upgrading?  Well, always wanted to do 3D, even in 2018 took rx570 for redering, but I was scammed and render wasn't working with that radeon GPU at all and with everything that happend in life I kinda left the idea. But now to much money was thrown away, so I don't have plans in backing up, i Would rather buy 5070ti and give away $200 more than sitting with halfworking piece of garbage.   SSD 512gb?  As i Said, I can buy more later, i'm already in debt with this build.",Neutral

AMD,"Thankfully and also unfortunately I'm gaming less and less every day, I don't consider myself old but I'm getting tired more easily and I'd rather unwind watching something than gaming these days.   That all being said, I still love the dance before building a new rig, watching reviews, comparing prices, using PCPP to check that everything will fit, go to the subreddits to get opinions, pull the trigger, wait for the hardware to arrive, take my Saturday to put it together and fire it up for the first time is the closest I'll have to having a child.   But now every time I try to juggle the parts list and the prices it makes no damn sense to upgrade. I don't even really need to it's just my love for building rigs and passing down my old ones to my brother or other family members.   I was waiting for the end of the year to do it but with RAM prices having gone through the roof it makes no sense at all, like I was counting on getting a normal 6000Mhz CL30 kit, they were going for 120/140 bucks, now they're over 300 or more.   Heck I almost bought a 2x24GB 6000Mhz CL26 kit for 320 bucks three months ago to call it a day and I chickened out thinking they would get cheaper lol.   I remember this happened with DDR4 around 2018 or so, but the prices were still somewhat acceptable, like a good kit was around 90/110 and they went to 180/200. Expensive, but not deal breakers.

AMD,it is a scam. nothing else.,Negative
AMD,"They're raising prices because sales of CPUs, motherboards, and other DIY PC components have plummeted in recent months due to DDR5 memory prices surging. This sales drop has forced AMD to lower their forward guidance for their CPU business, and the only short term prayer they have to combat this drop in revenue is to raise prices and push these parts up-segment.  Basically, gaming PCs are, in the near future, moving away from higher volume mass market to lower volume luxury and will be priced accordingly.",Negative

AMD,they were already expensive and now they are gonna rise it even more?  I guess I'll stay with my intel motherboard a bit more... at least until AM6.,Negative
AMD,"Maybe hot take or unpopular opinion, but PC parts are still historically cheaper than ever before. I remember my dad bringing home a Pentium 2 that was like $5000.

AMD,to be fair anyone who's building a gaming PC and putting up with these ram prices won't bat an eye at an extra 10-15% CPU cost,Negative
AMD,"I don’t think that’s the idea because CPU prices aren’t going to drop back down unless RAM prices do to. Anyone buying a new CPU has to also buy RAM, so CPUs aren’t going to sell much more just because they’re cheaper if RAM prices aren’t the bottleneck.  I think it’s more likely that they recognize that overall sales will go down due to RAM costs, and anyone looking to buy a CPU in the next few years will be less price sensitive since they’re willing to shell out for RAM. I’d imagine they’re doing this then to offset the lower volume.",Neutral
AMD,"It helps compensate for lower sales volume. If you know demand for your product is relatively inelastic you can increase your prices in the face of market headwinds to make greater margin at reduced volume. It does leave you open to being undercut by your competitors, but AMD is so far ahead in CPU right now that they might feel they can take the risk.",Neutral

AMD,"Just finished my build a few weeks ago slowly buying parts over the previous month and a half.  I got every single part under MSRP, including the 5080, except for the damn Ram.  But even then I avoided the worst of the price hike.  Paid $240 for 32 gb of 6000 CL30 beginning of November.  Same kit costs $480 now.  Prices are going to be nutty when the Ram spike and subsequent shortage settles and trickles down to GPUs, prebuilts, etc along with whatever tariff bullshit Trump is doing.",Negative

AMD,They’re not going to make less money just because a small number of people decide to stop buying.  They’ll just pivot to AI or to enterprise-related buyers.  AMD doesn’t have chip fabs.  TSMC makes their 9000 series CPU’s for them.  I’m sure they can tell TSMC to manufacture something else.,Neutral
AMD,What ecosystem can sustain that though?,Neutral
AMD,That doesn't work for processors. There will always be chips that don't test at 100% speed so they lower the price and sell them as a lesser model. It's not like they're just going to trash the ones that only function at 90%.,Negative
AMD,"No clue what you are talking about. GPUs have usually been the most expensive parts.  Why are people even downvoting this? A 7500F system went from 350-400$ to spending close to that ON THE RAM ALONE. So entry level AM5 can cost about $600 right now. People who can't afford this, will just not upgrade, i.e. not buy CPUs. Meaning: Sales go down.  GPUs have no direct relation to ANY other part prices, so I have no clue what they mean with their comment. You can upgrade your GPU as long as your PC has a PCIe slot and a good enough PSU. And even GPUs in full systems are barely affected because a $2k being 10% more expensive due to RAM is much less relevant than a 50% increase on your individual CPU upgrade.",Negative
AMD,"Well, it reduces the amount of buyers. And fewer buyers -> more stock -> lower prices. So it goes up by 10-15% due to AMD and then down due to supply.",Neutral
AMD,"Well, that is what I meant: They raise prices to compensate for the expected losses in sales. Practically speaking, they are making the retailers pay for their losses in sales volume, because CPU pricing is directly related to the RAM pricing.  Sure, that might just be $20-30 out of $600 total for your upgrade, but you'll still see an overall effect on the purchases. For a single person, it might not matter much to spend 20 bucks more, but in terms of the whole market, even small average price increases will show up in sales.  And keep in mind - Intel might be down atm, but they still exists and compete - and they'll potentially release their new architecture next year. So this is not just AMD increasing prices in a vacuum. The Ultra 235 is already contesting with 9700X and 7700X, the Ultra 225 with the 9600X and 7600X.",Neutral
AMD,"AMD isn't actually that far ahead. Non-X3D CPUs are head-to-head with Intel, if not worse in terms of value. That's just something that people aren't really talking about that much.  Intel has flown under the radar since the whole 13th/14th gen disaster, but they are far from dead. Even Apple is apparently going to produce some of their M-chips with Intel's new production process.

Median income has however only increased by 3% since 2017. So relatively speaking GPU prices have increased even more disproportionately.  Also it should be pointed out that nvidia has since shifted the model stack a tier down. The 1080 Ti was the same die as the Titan. The 3080 was on the same die as the 3090. The 80 series was *very much* closer in performance to the halo card.   Now the 5080 is more comparable to what a 1070 was back in 2017 or a 3070 in 2020.

As you can see, besides the flagship performance, pricing isn't actually that bad. And realistically, the flagship is of no real relevance for the typical gamer (and isn't really always comparable because flagship performance is really just what Nvidia choose it to be due to their monopoly on the high-end).  This is offtopic, though. Not even sure why I get downvoted for pointing that out.   GPU pricing is barely affected by other parts because it is the most expensive compent in like 90% of cases. If you buy a $2k build, $100-200 more sucks, but that isn't gonna change much about you having $2k to spend.  CPUs, on the other hand, are directly affected by RAM and mainboard pricing - and if RAM suddenly costs $100-200 more, then your CPU upgrade costs that much more.

Now the 5080 is more comparable to what a 1070 was back in 2017 or a 1070 in 2020.   Yeah, we're getting some real shrinkflation from Nvidia's newer cards. The 80 class is effectively extinct. The 80 Ti used to provide performance within spitting distance of the current gen 90/Titan class cards for a fraction of the price, and the regular 80s weren't far behind. There is no card in the 50 series lineup that matches either description.  The 5080 is definitely the worst 80 class card of all time. It's not meaningfully better than the 5070 Ti, and to my knowledge it's the only 80 class card that does not beat or even match the performance of the previous generation's 90/Titan class.  It is more accurate to call it a 70 class, but shit, 70 class cards as recent as 4070 Super traded blows with the 3090. You can't even say that about the 5080 and the 4090.",Neutral
AMD,"And then you look at the 1080 which is $808 MSRP with inflation but for only 10-15% performance increase instead of 50% and compare that to the 5070 Ti at $749 MSRP with 30% performance increase (over the respective 70 models). So 50 series is way better value here.  With the 5080 you also compared a release card of the 50 series to a card that released a year after the 10 series came out originally. So 1080 Ti pricing should be closer to the (now delayed) 5080/5070Ti Super, if anything.  You need to look at the overall picture. Don't just pick the data that fits your conclusion. The overall picture is: Not much has changed. Nvidia specifically has some more agency over pricing due to their AI quasi-monopoly, but for gaming, it really isn't that bad atm.",Neutral

There is no longer a product offering that provides performance within spitting distance of the 90/Titan class card. Fact.  >So if you claim that the 70 is good, then 80 just got better.  I never claimed that at all, don't put words in my mouth.  The 50 series has some of the worst stagnation we've ever seen from a new generation. You bringing up the 5070 stat is meaningless, especially when the 5070 is only about as good as the last generation 4070 Super. It fails to even beat the 4070 Ti, when every other 70 class card before it was at least able to soundly beat the 70 Ti of the last generation.  Taking all of this into account, it's clear the utter lack of generational uplift on the 5070 is what's responsible for the 5080's growing lead. Insinuating that this is instead the result of 5080 being good value or providing good generational uplift rather than the 5070's failure to improve is completely disingenuous.  And we see this all across the 50 series' product lineup. The 5060 Ti 16 GB can't even beat the 4070, when the 3060 Ti was beating the 2080 Super. The 5060 can't even beat the 4060 Ti 8 GB, when the 3060 was beating the 2070. The 5070 Ti can at best match the 4080, when the 4070 Ti was beating the 3090.  And all this is corroborated by the [diminishing relative core count](https://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large/public/inline-images/cuda_percent_7_full-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp) to the flagship we see in these newer generations. The current 5080 has a relative core count that is comparable to what the 70 class cards of the past offered.  If we look at the 30 series (the last generation to provide generational improvements across the board, and not just for select cards), we see how bad it currently is.  The 5080 offers 50% of the 5090's core count for 50% of the price. Seems reasonable, but it becomes a shit value proposition when you consider that the 3070 offered **56%** of the 3090's core count for only **33%** of the price. For a more direct relative price comparison, the 3080 offered **83%** of the 3090's cores for **53%** of the price.  The 5070 offers 28% of the 5090's cores for 27.5% of the price. Again, seems reasonable until you consider the price to relative core ratio of the 3070 I just mentioned. To rub salt into the wound, spending **26.6%** of the 3090's MSRP would have gotten you a 3060 Ti with **46.3%** of the cores.  By relative core count, the 5080 should be a 70 class. And this translates over to performance, too. The 5080 is only 66% as fast as the 5090, while the 3070 was 70% as fast as the 3090 was. What used to be the 80 class is extinct, there's no denying it.  I really don't understand why you're going to bat so hard for Nvidia here. Unless you literally work for their PR department and are paid to do this, you gain absolutely nothing trying to justify and rationalize the diminishing returns and increasing shrinkflation we've been seeing from the consumer cards.

How am I supposed to know that you don't think a 70 class card trading blows with the prior 90 model is not good? Why even write that as a seemingly positive example then? That is just misleading.  >The 5080 is the only 80 class card to not beat or even match the previous generation's 90/Titan class. Fact.  Which means little because Nvidia is the one setting the comparison for flagship. They can release a 90 series card that is just a refresh and there is nothing you can do about it cause they are a quasi-monopoly in the high-end. Thus, flagship performance is a really bad baseline to work with. What you should set as a baseline, is the main consumer cards, i.e. 60 and 70 models (maybe add 80 for the high-end consumer), that set the baseline for hardware prerequisites - and this baseline IS actually relevant for gaming.  >The 50 series has some of the worst stagnation we've ever seen from a new generation.

The current 5080 has a relative core count that is comparable to what the 70 class cards of the past offered.  Which is even less relevant. It does not matter. Practically NOONE buys GPUs for relative core count - consumers buy it for performance. Whether Nvidia saves more money by using smaller chips or not - as long as you get the performance you need for a certain price, that is a non-argument.  >I really don't understand why you're going to bat so hard for Nvidia here.

Sure, if the 6090 has a performance uplift as marginal as the one from the 3090 to the 3090 Ti then your argument may have a leg to stand on. But that has not happened. Well, it did for the 5070, but that's another topic.  The 80 class used to provide similar die sizes and core counts as the 90/Titan class. It no longer does. No matter what mental gymnastics you'd like to do to justify this, you cannot deny this.  >What you should set as a baseline, is the main consumer cards, i.e. 60 and 70 models (maybe add 80 for the high-end consumer), that set the baseline for hardware prerequisites  And given the shrinking relative core counts and die sizes, it's clear that Nvidia can set these mid range tiers just as arbitrarily as they set ""the comparison for flagship"" as you say. You bring up the hypothetical that they can release a next gen 90 series card that is just a refresh. I bring up the reality that they *actually did that* for the 5070. Tell me then, why would the ""main consumer cards"" serve as a better baseline when the exact thing you claimed might happen to the 90 series actually happened to the 70 series?  If anything, your ""5070 -> 5080 = 50%"" is even more invalid than making comparisons to the flagship class, because the 70 class is a stagnant product and what your comparison is really saying is that the 5080 is only 50% faster than a 70 class card from the last generation.  >Which also means nothing because we are talking about the prices for the consumer. Whether the market stagnates or not is IRRELEVANT to the level of pricing.  It does mean something, because you are completely ignoring the aspect of value here. The 5070 being $50 less than the 4070 Super is not a particularly big win when I could have bought the 4070 Super at launch and got an entire year of usage out of it before the 5070 even came out and provided no performance uplift.  Hell, by your logic, they could have released the 5070 at $600 (making it a literal rebadge of the 4070 Super) and you would have been fine with that, and fine with comparing it to a 5080 because ""stagnation is irrelevant to pricing"". Never mind the shitty value proposition that would be.  You used to be able to spend less than a grand (even adjusted for inflation) on a 3080 and get something that was pretty much just as good as the best GPU in the world at the time. *That's* a meaningful metric for value, not comparing a 5080 to a lower tier graphics card that isn't even better than its predecessor.  >Practically NOONE buys GPUs for relative core count - consumers buy it for performance.  Well, good thing I brought up performance in my comment then! Did you have trouble seeing it? I can make it bigger so you don't miss it this time.  # The 5080 is only 66% as fast as the 5090 (at 50% the price), while the 3070 was 70% as fast as the 3090 was (at 33% the price).  That's a pretty good argument for the shitty value of the current 80 class, no?  >Whether Nvidia saves more money by using smaller chips or not - as long as you get the performance you need for a certain price, that is a non-argument.  This only matters if we can get better performance out of shrinking dies. The 4070 Super had a much smaller die than the 3090 and matched it in performance. In that case, sure, they got the same performance out of less silicon, and could justify the diminishing relative core count.  But saying it's a non argument no matter what as long as ""you get the performance you need"" is an awful argument. That is just settling for mediocrity and stagnation. By your logic, the 6070, and 7070, and 8070 could come out, be exactly the same as the 5070 for the same price, and it'd be a perfectly fine product because ""you get the performance you need"".  >that Nvidia used to be much better - And I am telling you: No, they weren't.  And how do you justify this? The hard fact is that you used to be able to buy a 70 class card that would match the flagship card of the previous generation. Or an 80 class card that would soundly beat it. Each new generation (save for a couple exceptions) offered incredible value in that sense. This one does not. You literally cannot ignore the diminishing generational improvements we have been seeing.  I'm not saying Nvidia was some great company before, but when we literally do not see the generational improvements they used to provide, how can you sit here and claim that ""they weren't better"" before? Nostalgia glasses do not tint the relative performance charts on TechPowerUp.",Negative

AMD,"Interesting. It's an easy question with a not so easy logic. Here's how I see it:  7800X3D/X870E: - A future proof board. - PCIE 5.0 support. - Up to 5 M.2 NVME SSD, two of which support Gen 5. - Tons of ports with USB 4.0. - Supports up to 4 SATAs at 6/gbs. - Up to 256gb of RAM. - Plenty Fan, AIO, and RGB connectors. - 7800X3D performance is not too far behind a 9800X3D, so it won't be a bottleneck anytime soon. Best performance/$ value.  9800X3D/B650E-E (TUF?): - A solid board. - PCIE 4.0 support. - Up to 3 M.2 NVME SSD, with primary supporting Gen 5. - Less ports with USB 3.0. - Supports up to 2 SATAs. - Up to 192gb of RAM. - Fans, AIO, and RGB connectors. - 9800X3D is the best CPU for gaming and some productivity at the moment. Will probably outlive some components.  These are all the important things (at least to me) that I remember from when I was doing some research for my current build. I ultimately went with a 9800X3D because of its performance and projected longevity, and a X870E because of how much features and future proofing it offers. But what really sold me on these is what I plan to do in the future. I'm currently running a digital storage and plex server with my older PC. In the future, my current build will be my next server, so having the option to expand the storage, memory, and connect more peripherals was a very attractive prospect.  Like I said, not an easy logic. To summarize it for you; buy the one that you think will satisfy your need and your expectations. But whichever one you choose, it's not a bad one.",Positive

AMD,I think your guess is right. I suspect they will update their entire line with UDNA when it releases,Neutral
AMD,"Remember, the main limit for an igpu is the memory bandwidth and latency since it uses ram. Strix halo has a wider bus thus higher bandwidth, but all the others use normal lpddr5x, for example in handhelds. It might be that a rdna4 igpu isn't really faster than a 3.5 one due to this aspect alone, even if it would have nice features like fsr4. They probably are waiting for ddr6 memory to increase the bandwidth and put stronger igpus in devices, or at least this is my theory.",Neutral
AMD,This is just a refresh of the current lineup. It is heavily rumoured that Zen6 will feature more cores.,Neutral

AMD,LPDDR5X 10667 is in mass production and matches the introductory data rate of LPDDR6 (if we ignore 1.5X channel/ECC overhead). They can brute force GB/s issue.   Also RDNA 3.5 has many of RAM BW saving tech as so we'll see how much they actually need to push this. See C&C breakdown and LLVM post u/Defeqel.  But it's an easy win for higher end configs for sure as they're prob BW starved rn.  AMD better have FSR4 INT8 ready by 2026 because RDNA 3.5 products are going nowhere. Even standard SoCs with Medusa Point (without dGPU die) will reuse RDNA 3.5 for another gen according to Kepler\_L2. No UDNA except for premium mobile SKUs (with seperate dGPU die bolted on) it seems u/SAUCEYOLOSWAG and u/Hero_The_Zero   But it's good enough for entry level as it doesn't need ML power of RDNA 4 or GFX13 and like u/J05A3 said it's new and it'll prob be a repeat of Vega 7nm iGPU except this time even more prolonged.,Neutral

But assuming your chip's IF is good, maxing out the FCLK with 4 sticks on both AM4 and AM5 is usually achievable with a few key tweaks and some trial and error (twrrd @ 3-4, correct Proc-ODT for your DRAM ICs, correct RTTs for your board, and finding the CLDO VDDP sweet spot of your IMC).  If you know the ins and outs of memory OC on both platforms, you will almost always be able to max out your linked FCLK limit before you run into your board/IMC MCLK limit with 4 sticks, at least assuming you didn't severely lose the IMC lottery (which is also a rarer occurrence than people think).""",Neutral

AMD,"In games, a CPU is almost never bandwidth constrained. It's always latency. Many games perform the same when you go from dual-channel to single channel.  What causes slowdown in games with heavy RT is pushing a couple hundred megs of BVH data to the GPU over PCIe for each frame, again mostly due to latency.

Even with all those memory channels, this wouldn't have helped memory bandwidth per core or per CCD because the pinch point is the CCD to IOD connection.

Your memory controller clock is running barely over half of what it would be at 6000. You can force the memory controller to run in 1:1 mode, but there's a good chance it won't be stable depending on silicon lottery and what your memory kit is.  It may be also worth checking if your kit has any lower frequency XMP profiles, using the one you currently are and manually reduce the speed to 6000, or grabbing buildzoid's easy timings and punching those in for 6000.

The 9850X3D will sell out quickly as long as it's in the ballpark of current pricing.",Negative
AMD,Worth it,Neutral

AMD,I'm so whelmed,Neutral
AMD,But will it be 4.7% more expensive? /s,Negative
AMD,Cool,Positive
AMD,And 4% !! Gosh imagine the seconds saved in a month,Neutral
AMD,The single core score is what I learned when I started onto console emulation on PC.,Neutral
AMD,"I have a feeling the IMC will stay the same, if AMD had to bin both the memory controller and the CPU cores so 6600 1:1 and/or 8600 1:2 would be possible and stable with the CPU running at 5.6+ GHz then they would only have a handful of 9850X3D processors to sell at a high price.  Imagine selling your 9800X3D (a good sample capable of doing 6400 1:1 CL28 with tight timings) and ending up with a 9850X3D stuck at 6000 MT/s in a 1:1 configuration.",Neutral
AMD,"Zen 6 will be a huge generational improvement due to the elimination of the Infinity Fabric bottleneck and having ""sea of wires"" instead. We'll see large bandwidth and latency improvements.",Positive
AMD,"The memory controller will be exactly the same because the memory controller is in the iodie and they are not changing the iodie   On an 8 core amd cpu, 6000mt/s is already hitting the bandwidth limit on the fabric speed   For 8000mts ram to matter at all, you need multiple chiplets for ccd",Neutral
AMD,Lmao. No. They did not design a better IMC for this cash grab gamer brain chip.,Negative
AMD,I just wish for better memory controller that can easily support 4 sticks of ram instead of 2. It's been too many years of wait.,Negative
AMD,Why would they improve the memory controller on this when its getting revamped for Zen 6.  I don't really see the point for 1 chip.,Neutral
AMD,"Will people go for it? By the time this is released the high performance RAM may cost the same, if not more, than the CPU",Neutral
AMD,And likely not very noticeable to anyone using a GPU worse than a 4090/5090,Negative
AMD,They seem to list it as the same power as the 9800X3D. I suspect this is just a better bin of zen5 chiplet,Neutral
AMD,"Not necessarily, they will be just better binned chips meaning higher clocks at lower voltage. Depending on how crazy these are binned you could technically have chips that pull similar power at 5.6ghz as a bad 9800x3d at 5.2.  I'm guessing most of them will just be a minor power increase over your typical 9800x3d.",Neutral
AMD,If it means cheaper 9800X3D why not,Neutral
AMD,"3700 for me, but yeah.",Neutral
AMD,"As someone with AM4, I'm just hoping the RAM prices comes back from the moon by the time Zen 6 is out. My 5800X is tired.",Neutral
AMD,"Rumors of zen7 also on am5, I'd love that too, I can wait. The 7700x is no slouch, even though it's not that much high end.",Positive
AMD,"Sometimes the silicon comes out way nicer than expected, that's why they introduce a higher model model to sell them as. They don't want to sell the 9800X3D's that perform close to 5% better as ""9800X3D's"". They will label them as a better model and sell them that way. If silicon performs worse than expected, they label and sell them as lower models.",Neutral
AMD,"I wouldn’t expect any memory controller difference. Even if a CPU had higher drive strength enabled, the memory chips on the DIMM would have to drive through the extra capacitive load of a second DIMM per channel being there.  The real solution for that problem is simply going threadripper with a second memory controller die. The problem with that is the drop in clock speeds ignoring cost of board and chip.",Neutral
AMD,Where is this idea coming from that there will be a better memory controller?,Neutral
AMD,"So, like nine months+ more?  Unless AMD suddenly switches up their strategy this round, it will be the same as before and we will get the non X3D parts first.  People are less and less willing to buy those for any sort of gaming load.",Negative
AMD,"It has been cooking for a while. AMD has released refreshes or updates to their lineup before. It has been almost a year since the 9800X3D released in that time they have no doubt either stockpiled or improved the process so much that they can justify a whole new part. And since it wont be another year before next gen, a mid lifecycle refresh is a great excuse to jump back to MSRP and keep selling CPU's.",Neutral
AMD,They bury intel on the charts further,Neutral
AMD,"4.7% is nothing in terms of cpu, just keep it",Neutral
AMD,no,Neutral
AMD,… or 10260X3D,Neutral
AMD,Because not everyone has a 7800x3d or 9800x3d some are still on am4 and want to upgrade this will entice them,Neutral
AMD,and all the extra money spent on power makes it worthless,Neutral
AMD,"Yep, I have the same feeling, which is why *(in that case)* it's going to be either ignored or hated.   Unless it comes at the same price as the current 9800X3D, and the 9800X3D drops in price slightly. Then it will be loved.",Neutral
AMD,Wait I was supposed to get 6400 not 6000? Fml.,Neutral
AMD,"We're gonna get owned by RAM prices, though.",Neutral
AMD,Has that been confirmed yet?,Neutral
AMD,"For the average Joe case you mentioned, barely any difference. The main gains would be waiting for Zen 6 *(next-gen CPU's on AM5 that should come by mid-to-end next year),* I would not waste a single $ on these if someone already has a 7800X3D or a 9800X3D.",Neutral
AMD,"I ran like 20 modern games at 1440p after I got my 5080, paired with a 7800x3d. I was gpu limited in every single one. By a lot. I have a 9800x3d now, and my fps did not increase in any game.",Neutral
AMD,Even then you most likely need to game at 720p low to see more fps.,Neutral
AMD,have you ever played world of warcraft? there's many more games like that.,Neutral
AMD,"tdp is only vaguely related to power draw. 9800x3d stock pulls 140w in all core loads and a 7800x3d pulls 75w, they both have the same TDP  https://skatterbencher.com/2023/04/05/skatterbencher-60-amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-overclocked-to-5400-mhz/#AMD_Ryzen_7_7800X3D_Stock_Performance  https://skatterbencher.com/2024/11/06/skatterbencher-82-ryzen-7-9800x3d-overclocked-to-5750-mhz/#AMD_Ryzen_7_9800X3D_Stock_Performance  TDP IS NOT POWER DRAW  TDP IS NOT POWER DRAW  TDP IS NOT POWER DRAW",Neutral
AMD,"This is not directed to you, but I am legitimately curious about where other people are getting the idea that this chip will run hotter?  I believe its rumored TDP (not representative of the actual power draw) is the same 120w, as the 9800X3D. It just seems to be better binned like you said.",Neutral
AMD,"If you can afford RAM, them prices going up every week",Neutral
AMD,"Same here. Bought upgrades for my wife's PC for her birthday just before prices launched (9600X, 32GB Crucial DDR5-6400 and an X870 Mobo since it was cheaper than the B650 I was originally looking at, all upgraded from an FX-8350 setup) but my PC will be staying on the 3700 for at least 1 more year.",Neutral
AMD,I just have to say I feel like a King right now with a 5800x3D and 32 GB RAM.,Positive
AMD,That won't happen. Forecast is at least 2027 if not 2028 until we see DRAM come down in price. It's only going to get worse before Zen 6.,Negative
AMD,It's a confirmed fake rumour anyway.,Negative
AMD,"I should have added, wait if you can, sorry :-D",Neutral
AMD,"Well as long as they price it right, I could see that being good. Like if they drop the 9800x3D price by like $75 and put this one on its launch MSRP.",Positive
AMD,"Especially in games, unless you play at 1080p for some reason.",Neutral
AMD,"With ram prices... is anybody not made of money on AM4 going to upgrade to AM5 now? AMD has pretty much just the existing AM5 userbase now to appeal to, and Intel 12-14th gen and that's really it.",Negative
AMD,"If efficiency was your purpose, you'd not be getting these chips anyway.",Negative
AMD,6400 requires a gold sample 9800X3D; most can only run 6000-6200.,Neutral
AMD,Still AM5 right? So we'll just have to stick with our 6000 kits for a couple more years.,Neutral
AMD,"Thats why i kept my older DDR5 ram kits, i have 3 sets now, so im good for years.",Positive
AMD,Already bought 48gb 6400 last year for my 7500f to upgrade to zen6,Neutral
AMD,will be pretty bad coming 2 years with ram prices,Negative
AMD,I wouldn't consider this with a 9800X3D. However due to clock speeds it looks to be a 20% difference from the 7800X3D so It would be a maybe for me on that chip. However all the big gains will be Zen 6.,Neutral
AMD,"I have nothing else to buy in 2026 though , might as well",Neutral
AMD,"That's why i keep my 7800X3D until Zen6, i'm also in 4K, so yeah gpu is the real limit here..",Neutral
AMD,Try Tarkov and come back after you've pulled your hair out,Neutral
AMD,"Nah, in CPU intensive games like battlefield6 it can be measured using normal resolutions.  It's very niche",Neutral
AMD,Yes and I know how bottlenecks work,Neutral
AMD,"TDP is ""thermal design power"" which refers to how much heat energy the cooling solution is expected to need to be able to exhaust in order for the device to run at manufactured spec.  The blanketed design of the x3d layer in the 7800x3d and earlier generations traps heat more strongly than in the 9800x3d where the x3d layer is on the bottom.   This trapping effect means that the older x3d cpus  cannot have too much power usage lest they burn, and that they need a stronger cooler than would typically be required for the amount of power they actually use lest they end up too hot and thermal throttle heavily.  I'm not saying the 9850x3d and 9800x3d are likely to use the same default power limits, but I am saying that their TDP are probably much more comparable than is the case as between the 9800x3d and 7800x3d.",Neutral
AMD,"Because usually in tech, CPU or GPU, higher clock speeds mean more power draw to achieve them. I'm sure in gaming with single threaded tasks there's no issues pushing 5.6GHz, but it will likely mean more wattage vs the 9800X3D doing those tasks IF the CPU is being pushed hard to make use of the extra. Plus higher clock speed you to go the silicon's limit, usually the efficiency curve plummets to get each extra bit of clock speed. Not sure how much 5.2 to 5.6GHz is pushing it, but the highest clocked Zen 5 is already only at 5.7GHz with the marked specs.",Neutral
AMD,"I’m on a 5600x3d, similar gaming performance to the 5800x3d and I can’t see myself upgrading till at least AM6",Neutral
AMD,"Right. My point is simply by understanding the underlying technology, such as rumor should never have become known unless someone could credibly explain how certain obstacles and technology limitations were overcome.  Personally, I have a flight sim using two systems and three GPUs. When originally bullt, the threadrippers didn’t have the clock speeds necessary to do what I needed for portions of code limited by single thread performance. I’m thinking hard about a strx50/wrx90 chip/board for next upgrade and collapsing two systems to one. Unfortunately the stupid DDR5 prices and overall cost of that jump are pushing it beyond budget right now. Getting rid of 1000-1500W of heat from one case is a solved problem for me and I already power off of 220V so even that’s not a concern.  The one x16 slot plus an X4 or x8+x8 +x4 are a bummer on AM4/AM5 because PCIe gen4 or gen5 100G Ethernet or 16/32g FC are costly, as are other solutions like PCIe fabric switches and the cabling.",Neutral
AMD,"I have built my first PC 5 days ago with a 9800X3D and 64GB 6400Mhz CL32 DDR5 ram and it runs stable with no issues in EXPO. Does that mean i have a ""gold sample""?",Positive
AMD,"Yeah us on AM5 will be okay... it's the people who don't have DDR5 already who are screwed and probs won't find any worth in upgrading when it'd cost so much.  Wonder how AMD will handle things with Zen 6 actually, they really can't charge too much now can they? The main market to appeal to now for them will be those already on a DDR5 platform, most of which will be AM5 owners (with some Intel 12-14th gen in the mix) where all the CPUs are still competent, just some on entry level Zen 4/5/Intel may still want something faster. Any AM4 owners who may have wanted to jump in next gen are screwed, same with old Intel platforms, AMD can't count on them anymore when RAM makes the platform switch itself insanity so AMD needs to get people with Rzyen 7600/7700s, other non X3Ds and Intel 12-14th gen owners want to buy Zen 6.",Neutral
AMD,"Haha, thats one of the games I didnt test. Could never get into it",Negative
AMD,"it's not just ""how much heat energy"" but the area it's being emitted from too. Also, it's not a standard formula that every manufacturer uses, one heatsink company uses a different formula to define their TDP compared to a different heatsink company, so they aren't even directly comparable.  For example, a 5 millimeter square piece of silicon using 120w needs a higher TDP cooler than a 10 millimeter square one also using 120w. Coupled with the TDP ""bins"" AMD wants to put their CPUs in (either 65w, 105w, 120w, nothing inbetween right now) you get these wide spread where you have two 120w TDP CPUs and one uses literally twice the power as the other and even goes above the TDP rating stock (9800x3d uses 140w, tdp is 120w), tdp is just about the general class of cooler you need and not much else",Neutral
AMD,"No, if all you did is enable expo then you are running 2:1 and getting worse performance than if you had 6000 1:1",Negative

AMD,"If this is anything like most AMD's other super high-end, late-in-cycle CPUs, it will be in limited quantity for a limited amount of time. Once Zen6 comes out, this thing will disappear like the 5800X3D. I figure the same thing will happen with the 9950X3D2. Except neither of those are going to take a price dip before falling completely off the market, unlike the 5800X3D.   Intel always did the same thing. All Extreme editions and KS models were short term, limited production.",Neutral
AMD,sounds like you hit a die lottery. you usually can't go past -30mv all core,Neutral
AMD,Meanwhile my 12900k PC over in the corner casually using 140 to 150w under a medium gaming load...  St least I can turn down the heater in winter I guess.  If ddr5 wasn't so stupid expensive I would switch. Well let's see in 2 or 3 years I guess. Thank you AI.,Negative
AMD,"For 99% of gaming, CPUs really don’t need much.",Neutral
AMD,It’s not Mv. It’s cycles - which is between 3-5mv. So 3-5Mv * 40 is what your undervolt actually is,Neutral
AMD,"That’s what I was hoping for my wife’s build, however I just might get myself a 9850X3D or splurge for a 9950X3D and put my 9800X3D in hers and run at the 65w tdp lvl.",Neutral
AMD,kind of*,Neutral
AMD,"Thanks for telling the other 9800X3D owners that they already know they don't care about a product that is a slight refresh of theirs.  What, do you want a medal for not caring?  Or you could perhaps recognize a large portion of the market isn't even on AM5 yet and these products still matter to them.",Negative
AMD,Likely q1 26. However if it holds true zen 6 x3d will come out the same year. That’s not me saying not to get the 9850x3d only don’t if u have a 9800x3d. But if u like to do a lot of upgrades u might as well wait for zen 6 at this point.,Neutral
AMD,No,Neutral
AMD,"I'm pretty sure no. As 9800x3D owner who was previously on 5950x, I won't notice slightly more single core perf. What would be a noticeably a boost would be having a rumored monolythic Zen6 12-core CPU. A bit more IPC and 50% more cores for few other use cases while no drawbacks of talking inter CCD.",Neutral
AMD,"It depends on what you consider ""worth it"".  You can sell 9800x3d and add a little to get 9850x3d if you really care about slightly more performance, maybe better OC to you're memory if you got a bad chip currently and a better resell quality later because this chip is simple newer.  I am interested in the fact how overclockable it would be, or not.. like, can it be run in 5.8 - 6.0 range without problems.",Neutral
AMD,The 9800x3D is already really efficient when undervolted without noticeable performance drop,Positive
AMD,Lel im here on 3900x and 6900xt,Neutral
AMD,14700K works with ddr4……,Neutral
AMD,Mine can't go past -15 lol,Neutral
AMD,"That's not exactly how it works though. The undervolt offset is relative to starting point, he could have more headroom for the exact opposite reason from a performance/watt perspective (chip running higher vcore values from the factory)  Undervolt values don't mean anything without the actual voltages, frequency, stability, and other contributing variables if we're keeping it real.  It can also mean what you suggest, but without more info it's impossible to conclude either way. -30mV means nothing in its own, a better chip out of the box running at -20mV could very well be outperforming it without having more info.",Neutral
AMD,"I have no idea how, but mine is stable with -45 and +125mhz. It's bonkers.",Negative
AMD,And the other 1% is shader compilation and city skylines II sim,Neutral
AMD,The most popular games played on Steam benefit quite a bit from x3D processors.,Positive
AMD,Depends on the game.  Simulations that run a lot of physics need powerful cpus,Neutral

AMD,"I think you're taking offense from nothing here, and this is a strangely rude response to it.",Negative
AMD,"True but Zen 5 isn't a good enough generational upgrade yet, clocking it higher for another 5% that will result in higher power consumption in gaming loads isn't what I want either.  Really this refresh is a big load of nothing? Other than for show offs and tech channels that can swap in a slightly faster gaming CPU for GPU testing as well as a review content vid to tide over until Zen 6 which AMD has slated for 2026... same year this binned CPU is releasing. Doubt it'll have the value proposition in Zen 6's life to make sense either as the non X3D parts are always a lot cheaper and fill the price to performance role as is, and Zen 6 in leaks looks like a good one for uplifts cache or not unlike 5 that had a more bottlenecked design that benefited the cache parts more uplift wise.   I'm sure it'll sell though, it's why AMD is doing it, Zen 5 X3D is their golden milking machine that sells for MSRP even now, obviously business wise makes sense to release the golden bins that can clock higher for an extra 5% performance at a premium for those who want the best of the best NOW. AMD leads in performance, those chasing the best will take it if they don't want to hold for Zen 6.",Negative

AMD,I wouldn’t be surprised if they are reasoning prices on CPUs to help hedge against rising ram cost.,Neutral
AMD,"There's legitimate no reason for a price hike.  There's a price hike in DRAM because nvidia is buying out all the allocation for their next gen AI GPUs. But 9000 series is built on *N4P whereas next gen AI GPUs will likely be built on N3P (Ruben) and N2P (Rubin Ultra, i.e. the ""SUPER"" refresh of AI GPUs). So there's no effect on AMD allocation as Nvidia have no need to buy out that node.*  AMD also likely have their allocation for N3P or N2P set for their next gen CPUs so unlikely to be hurt here either.  However, if rumours are true, all allocation for A16 has already been bought out by Nvidia, so there will be some competition down the line for sub N2P allocation between Apple, AMD and all of TSMC other high end customers.  We could even see CPUs stagnate for a few years over this.",Neutral

AMD,"In my opinion, AMD doesn't really need to raise the price for Ryzen 9XXX because-  1. It's been out for more than a year 2. Instinct is far more important for the stock than pure Ryzen revenue 3. Ryzen is now just a marketshare and mindshare play. 4. The more people buy into AM5, the more they'll be willing to upgrade to Zen 6 or 7 (if zen 7 is indeed on AM5), to divert people away from Nova Lake if Zen 6 is indeed a tad slower.",Neutral

AMD,"As someone on a 7600X...hold for Zen 6, pretty sure a slide AMD did last month put Zen 6 as 2026. This higher binned Zen 5 X3D is coming early 2026, it's just milking the last of what they can of Zen 5 X3D with a more expensive sku they can charge a premium for before Zen 6 tanks the value of such a part.   Like the clock speed boost is only 400mhz, that's maybe 7% higher boost (that will mean higher power draw), probably about 5-6% faster gaming performance if that. It isn't really going to change Zen 5 from being a skip to worth it if the 9800X3D wasn't enough for you already.   My plan is Zen 6, you'll get more cores per CCD as per leaks, AMD has confirmed a node leap which means higher clock speeds and better power efficiency so Zen 6 will be a GOOD generational leap for us, it won't be Zen 5% again.",Neutral

AMD,"I could, but the rumors around Zen 6, make it *very* appealing, such as: 7+GHz clock speeds (over the 7800X3D’s 5), 12-core CCDs, an improved memory controller/IOdie, more IPC, 2 (4?) LP cores, a NPU, and.. possibly other things. More L1, L2 cache as well. If those are all true, a 50% or so performance boost, worth the upgrade I think.  Zen 7 is enticing too, but at least 2 years out from Zen 6. While the rumors have it on AM5, we also don’t know how the RAM crisis will change things. If, god forbid, RAM remains hideously expensive for years, then is there really a downside to going to DDR6, for the performance it brings? I could even see it being *cheaper* than DDR5 at launch bc of where the LLM demand is. But idk, that’s all just speculation, and hopefully the AI bubble will break soon and it’ll be a non-issue. Zen 7 on AM5 would be nice, yeah",Positive
AMD,Plot twist if the 13700k multithreading throughput magically/finally ends up mattering,Neutral
AMD,"Way more likely is it’ll be some abomination with “AI” prominently in the name. After all, Zen 6 CPUs will have an NPU. I do not like this thought, but I fully expect AMD to do it *unless* the AI bubble pops before then.",Negative
AMD,$350? Must only be getting a single 8gb stick....,Neutral
AMD,"350? That's still cheap by today's standard. I paid like 280 or something for 96GB for my 13th Gen Intel build. 16GB kits are aroubd that price now.   ""Nah dawg. $350,000"" lol",Neutral
AMD,Yeah that seems to be another problem,Negative
AMD,Then why comment if you’re not interested?,Neutral
AMD,"Because X3D of previous gen gets some discount when a new platform gets released, like 5800X3D was for a couple of months when AM5 got released (then price shot to the moon because last gen top chip of AM4 platform). So like the theoretical 11800X3D (if that gen is still AM5) or maybe a lower binned 11700X3D is gonna be cheaper when AM6 gets released.",Neutral
AMD,Likely waiting until 2030+ for that and paying a \*huge\* premium. 2029/2030 for Zen 7 X3D> 2035-2037 for Zen 10/Zen 11 X3D (whichever is the final AM6 gen) seems much more wiser.,Neutral
AMD,This is the way,Neutral
AMD,Yes AM5 7800x3D or 9800x3d would a good upgrade but i guess I'll wait till another gen. Currently my rig just sits at home most of the year because of work travel.   My current main setup is a LP7 7945HX 4080mobile. I have modded my laptop a bit which allowing me OC my CPU and ram which is running at 6000 CL36-37-37-34. Currently I am trying to tune a 6200 profile.   The FPS I get in both setups is pretty similar. I guess its because of the 5800x3D and slower ddr4.,Neutral

AMD,Felt like it.,Neutral
AMD,And DDR6 won't be cheap at all.,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, but then you will have to rebuy literally everything, from motherboard to ram, instead of buying the first AM6 X3D and maybe last X3D when AM7 will be out or close to it",Neutral
AMD,I’m planning the same except getting 11950x3d. If I’m going to be riding it for years might as well go with the best of the best chip.,Neutral
AMD,Yup bought mine right at that moment (also because DDR5 was too expensive) and I‘m still very much bottlenecked by my GPU…,Negative
AMD,"exactly, first and last AM6 now that we re on last AM4.",Neutral
AMD,"MLiD usually predicts things further out, so he tends to be more inaccurate compared to many leakers, this isn't a surprise to me. Naturally, when you are talking about products a couple years out, lots of things aren't ""nailed down"" by the companies themselves, and therefore are subject to change. I'll also say something that applies to all leakers/rumormongers and not MLiD specifically: people like to slam them when they're wrong, but rarely give kudos when they're right. Either wrong or right, I do find the rumors to be entertaining though!  Zen 6 is jumping several nodes. Obviously we'll have to wait for released CPUs and independent testing to have an informed opinion as to how good they are, but with AMD jumping several nodes next-gen, the rumors at least strike me as plausible.. you may feel differently.",Neutral
AMD,"Exactly. Though those products have had problematic names for years now. So I certainly wouldn’t be surprised if they did it with desktop too. AMD does make stupid decisions, sometimes.",Negative
AMD,Gigachad,Neutral
AMD,"Except I don't because why should I upgrade within the platform? That's never necessary. I can just go to the next platform in like 8-10 years after the build, which is right around the timeframe from Ryzen 5000 and Ryzen 11000 too.",Neutral
AMD,">Zen 6 is jumping several nodes  This is also speculation  Rumors are rumors, and they're at least half of AMD's source of disappointment, the other half being their own marketing team.  It's fine to see rumors and ""leaks"" as entertainment, but to refer to them as a reason to buy X or hold off till Y or whatever is nonsense.  The reason we shouldn't credit MLiD when he's right, is because he usually keeps spewing BS until we're down to the wire and starts predicting things right as things get confirmed. He's unreliable at best.",Negative
AMD,"thats exactly what im saying lol. Why but last AM5 and then again AM6 when you can buy directly first and last AM6, which you will do anyways, but you just make it more expensive by buying AM5 too ""again""",Negative
AMD,"> Zen 6 is jumping several nodes  > This is also speculation  No it's not, not really. AMD, unless they're morons, will be using whatever current node was on offer, and that's TSMC N2 (N2P/N2/N2X). That's several nodes improved.   > the other half being their own marketing team.  Yeah, I'm in agreement there. Their marketing team, that whole side of AMD is just terrible. And we just ""know"" they're going to name their desktop Zen 6 CPUs with some naming abomination that has ""AI"" all over it.  > It's fine to see rumors and ""leaks"" as entertainment, but to refer to them as a reason to buy X or hold off till Y or whatever is nonsense.  Context/details matter. Ofc one shouldn't hold off a buying decision for a couple years based on rumors that could easily turn out to be wildly off. However, a few months out, when there's substantive leaks from multiple sources, would be a whole different thing.  Obviously Zen 6 (and Intel Nova Lake for that matter) is at least a year out, and ofc has totally unproven performance. All that said, it's hardly any secret what the node jumps make possible, and so AMD *could* do what is rumored, which is obviously not the same as saying they *will* do it.  > The reason we shouldn't credit MLiD when he's right, is because he usually keeps spewing BS until we're down to the wire and starts predicting things right as things get confirmed. He's unreliable at best.  I'm not going to comment on MLiD or any other leaker or Youtuber specifically. People have their opinions, and I can respect those. Getting into that sort of discussion just invites drama, which I try to avoid.",Neutral
AMD,Zen 6 jumping nodes is revealed in public roadmaps though?,Neutral
AMD,"Because we upgrade our CPU's after 7-8 years since the last one? By the time I feel the need to upgrade, if I bought in at the start of a generation, a new gen is already out.   I just saved hundreds by not buying into AM5 at the start of 7000 series and I feel like I don't need to upgrade until AM6 comes out since this AM4 gen still does everything I need",Neutral

AMD,And what is the point of that if they refuse to add infinity cache to it when 890m barely scales with performance beyond even 2ghz due to memory bandwidth bottleneck?,Negative
AMD,AMD as usual are not able to produce enough chips to fill Lenovo or Dell mainstream offers.   This chip 370/365 was available only in two Asus models and it's hard to buy it around the world.,Neutral
AMD,You are going to see an Intel with Nvidia iGPU in handheld before you see FSR 4.0.,Neutral
AMD,Or any mobile AMD solution at all (laptops began to outsell desktops 20 years ago).,Neutral
AMD,"The workload of FSR4 is pretty “constant” per frame for a given input and output resolution, and it doesn’t care about the original game graphics settings. So a smaller iGPU is going to use too much of the frame time and have too much overhead added.   Navi44 is a 16WGP card.  The Strix iGPU is 8, and Krackan is 4.   For example: At 1080p output, a (14WGP) RX 6700S uses ~3ms to process FSR4, compared to ~2.2ms for XeSS and ~0.7ms for FSR 3.1.5 according to some guys Reddit post.   9070XT (32WGP) was 0.6ms given native FP8.   Even RDNA4 on these iGPU, it would take 4.8ms alone just to run FSR4 upscaling.  Would take your 60fps lower res render down to 47fps. You’d have to get 84fps rendered to get a 60fps upscaled.   That ignores the fact that RDNA4 has physically larger compute units in silicon so it becomes an unfair comparison on an “equal CU” basis.",Neutral
AMD,Isn't there still hope for an official int8 version ?,Neutral
AMD,"Not really, Intel made a good product with Lunar Lake, but not too many carriers are making it compared to those with AMD chips, and theyve obviously already secured contracts with PlayStation and Xbox.   They only really lost ground to the Switch which already happened.",Neutral

AMD,">when 890m barely scales with performance beyond even 2ghz due to memory bandwidth bottleneck?  Source for this?   Also, I'm curious, if the source for this also compares how different iGPU archs also scale with additional frequency.",Neutral
AMD,"It is also getting an upgrade to 8533 mt/s which is sure only a 7% increase from 8000 but since most strix point devices only got 7500 ram, it should help quite a bit.",Positive
AMD,They are rather easily available and there are even miniPCs available. HX 370/375 overall aren't used in gaming laptops and end up in thin/lightweight pro models.,Positive

AMD,And ARM+Nvidia,Neutral
AMD,Won't see FSR4 on handhelds and laptops til Zen 7 or even Zen 8.,Neutral
AMD,"INT8 FSR4 is only DP4a. It needs a WMMA version to be usable on RDNA3/3.5. The only WMMA INT8 version in development is for PS5 Pro's PSSR 2.0, which is a fork of FSR4's upscaler (and maybe FG component).   Technically, most of the code should be usable on RDNA3, excluding any Sony-specific changes. So, it wouldn't really take much extra work to bring it to PC hardware. Non-zero chance. I remain slightly pessimistic about it.   Because PS5 Pro works more with fixed frame rates and varying resolutions, the upscaler algorithms are markedly different vs variable frame rates and relatively static resolutions (like FSR4 Quality's 67% scale or 1440p -> 2160p). This is the largest issue and why PSSR 2.0 is a full fork of FSR4 and could actually have higher overhead as it tries to handle changing image resolutions. Could make it a superior implementation too, especially if it can maintain high upscaled image quality from varied source resolution frames.  WMMA INT8 is 512 ops per CU per clock on RDNA3.   DP4a is roughly 64 ops per CU per clock (4xINT8 ops packed into 32-wide SIMD x2, allowing for quadruple throughput vs a single INT8 op within SIMD32); unfortunately, INT32 cannot use dual ALUs like FP32 can, else output would be 128 ops/CU - this restriction ends in RDNA5 because INT ops are now important for neural rendering and denoising  So, WMMA INT8 (mixed with FP16 for decimal values) allows for an 8x increase in throughput, which will dramatically reduce time per frame.",Neutral
AMD,"Considering how much time has passed, highly unlikely at this point.",Neutral
AMD,Int8 version sucks.,Negative
AMD,"wouldn't make a huge difference. the int8 version is visually noticeably worse and it'll still perform worse on RDNA 3 even with int8 I am fairly certain. It would be fair to call it FSR 3.5, but it's not FSR 4",Negative
AMD,"I was being a bit hyperbolic.  But there are some different factors at play here.  When the 258v came out, it wasn’t good.  It took a software update fairly late after launch to make it the beast it is.  Which certainly kills momentum from partners to build devices.  This time around, it looks like the next chip will come swinging out of the gate.  Amd won’t have anything new, so there is little reason to refresh devices with them.  But Intels chip will be new, and the rumors are looking very strong.  The biggest difference is the 258v is tsmc.  The chip is super expensive and Intel can’t do much about it.  The next gen chip is built on Intel foundry, and will be far less expensive for them/they could more easily take a financial hit on it.  Amd has nothing until mid 2027.  Sure it’s going to be good and will likely power the steam deck 2 and both consoles, but that’s a year and a half+ away.  I don’t think amd is going to be in trouble or anything, but there is actual competition now.  We couldn’t even speak about a steam deck 2 being reasonable before.  Now it’s totally possible that deck 2 launches with a next gen intel chip.  Not that I think it will, but it’s possible.",Negative
AMD,"The other rumour post seems to say even Medusa is rdna 3.5.  Absolutely pathetic if true.   Combined with the rumoured reduction of CU count from 16 to 8, we are looking at ***negative iGP improvement*** in the 15-45w class laptop from July 2024 to whenever Zen 7 mobile comes out maybe in 2028.

AMD,Medusa Halo (both versions) will definitely support FSR4.,Neutral
AMD,Probably more like a CES announcement or something Q1 2026 like that. That's when FSR3 was announced,Neutral
AMD,The presentation of the next version of FSR4 is December 10th - they might very well announce FSR4 for RDNA 3.5 then (but if they don’t then FSR4 will likely stay RDNA4+ exclusive),Neutral

AMD,"That would be terrible, I heard that it was zen 6 + rDNA 5 for Medusa,   According to MLID, the same sauce that leaked strix halo suggested that medusa halo mini would be the iGPU upgrade to strix point with 24CU rDNA5 and lpddr6, so decent improvement if true in 2027.",Negative

AMD,And have been a thing for much longer than that too.  The tegras have been around for a while now,Neutral
AMD,"yes, AMD's skill issue",Neutral
AMD,"Vega 8 on ryzen 4000 compensated with drastically higher clocks and while it was not memory bound. It was also not “massively better”, far from it.   This thing is going from 2.9ghz to 3.1ghz all the while 890m already stopped scaling beyond low 2ghz never mind much higher.",Negative
AMD,"It is roughly 20% faster than the older generation, pretty decent if you ask me.  Unless you have a crystal ball or works at AMD I recommend you to wait and see",Positive
AMD,Yes because an almost 50% clock increase from vega 11 to vega 8 with a node shrink from GloFlo 12nm to TSMC 7nm is comparable to 6% clock increase on the same node.   Some of you don’t even know discussion of rumours has to have _some_ underlying hardware facts to base off of just because y’all speculate without base you assume everyone does the same.,Neutral

AMD,"Not to get super political (I know mods, but it's relevant - hear me out) - the reason that companies engage in this ""chasing margin"" behavior is because of right-wing low-tax policy.    There's no disincentive (in fact, there's a huge tax incentive) to raise prices.  If you want to make a billion dollars, there are two ways to do it - sell a billion things with a $1 profit margin, or 1 this with a $1 billion profit margin.  The structure of the taxes determines which is 'easier' or more highly incentivized.    Our tax system right now awards some of the lowest tax rates to the higher income earners (corporations and very wealthy individuals) - thus it is favorable to raise prices and sell fewer copies of each item.    This is why inflation has been so bad and uncontrollable - because there is a strong incentive to raise prices.",Neutral

They aren't worth it.   For that cpu, I""d go air cooler though. They are simpler, cheaper, less to go wrong. Just make sure the cpu cooler height is lower than the case CPU cooler height. It will be listed on the Corsair case specs. The rest is easy. It just goes on the CPU. Intake fan on front blowing air into the metal hunk, exhaust fan pulling air off of the cooler towards the rear of the case blowing air away from the cooler.   And for fan placement.

AMD,Do you have any examples of this? Raising taxes to lower prices doesn't make intuitive sense.,Negative
AMD,"I would disagree. It is not really political. It is inflation based. Inflation in reality (not in media or political commentary) is preceded by wage disparity. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer. Companies are then able to ""markup"" a product and ""limit"" supply, increasing demand. Those with greater wealth will just outbid those with less money, much like an eBay auction. The producers see this and maintain the higher margin, and then raise the bar again to test a new level.    So this problem has been brewing for 50 years and is unlikely to change anytime soon. You need more wealth (greater pay) to the working class and modest middle class and less money to the upper class/mgmt class. Then you would see a reversion to quantity based pricing because more people have more money to purchase goods compared to a concentration of greater wealth into a smaller group of people (where we are today).    We all hate it, but a business has the goal of maximizing revenue. In a world where wealth concentrates into fewer hands, the business has to target that group of people and get them to pay higher margins. It is the world we have allowed our government officials to create for us all the while worshipping the ground they walk on and campaigning for them instead of questioning them.",Neutral

But as of now, we don't really have any information that directly points to a competing product.      In fact, I might be crazy but I feel like it is more likely that the actual answer to Strix Halo will be all Intel silicon, because Nvidia is very horny for all things ai and all things datacenter.",Neutral
AMD,"I mean no offense, but Passmark is irrelevant.  Even comparing the 890m to the 7600m (non-xt), the 7600m is usually twice as fast, with dips down to ~60% faster, and lifts up to ~170% faster.     NoteBookCheck has an extremely robust dataset of benchmarks in games for both the 890m and the 7600m (non-xt) at various resolutions, and they show not only a clear winner, but a very large difference in the performance of these devices.      Now I'm not trashing what the B390 will be, because we need an iGPU fight here.  But thinking that the 7600m (non-xt) is only ~15.7% faster than the B390 ((new-old)/old gives percent change) because of Passmark is erroneous.",Neutral

I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works. It's like the 2001 Toyota of the laptop world, it's not winning prizes for looks, but it'll never die, gets good mileage (battery life), and is easily repairable. Maybe not the laptop you want, but definitely the one you need (excluding people who need something like a dedicated GPU or really need super high CPU performance).",Positive

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance. I’ve shown full system specs and game settings every time, and provided more evidence than any tech site or tech YouTuber ever has, yet some people are still in denial.

AMD,"What’s fake about it? What scores are you getting? Prove me wrong with score screenshots, not with fanboyism false accusations.

AMD,"Two things can be true at the same time. Arrow lake has legitimately improved since it launched last year, and Intel is portraying it in the best, most optimal light they can that is probably not representative of a broad spectrum of games reviewed by a third party.   It would be interesting to get a retest of arrow lake now, but I dunno if it is worth the time investment for some reviewer like TPU or HWUB to re-review a relatively poor platform that’s already halfway out the door.",Positive
AMD,"Arrow Lake performs quite well at general compute and power efficiency compared to prior generatons ans even against AMD.  Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU. Ironically the 9070 performance was identical with a 9700X and a 9800X3D.  So it's actually kind of the reverse, gaming reviewers painted Arrow Lake in the worst possible light.",Neutral
AMD,What do you mean by gaslighting in this case?,Neutral
AMD,"The answer depends on whether or not you're a ""next-gen AI gamer"" (apparently that means 1080p avg fps with a RTX 5090).",Neutral
AMD,I doubt they would give false numbers. Those are probably what you get with the setup they list in fine print. Also they pretty clearly show the 3dx parts are faster in gaming. But they have probably picked examples that show them in a good light.   There is nothing wrong per se in the arrow lake lineup. In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all. The issue that destroyed the image of arrow lake is that the previous generation was often faster in gaming. That made every reviewer give it bad overall reviews.,Neutral
AMD,Wait till refresh comes out in December... Memory latency lower and performance boosted. Price also lower... Wish it could come to the old chips but it architecturally cant. :(,Negative
AMD,"generally they cherry pick, so maybe the demo they use is process heavy with minimal I/O (arrow's biggest performance hit is memory movement). if you manage to keep memory movement low core performance is actually really good on arrow lake. it just gets massacred by d2d and NGU latency, which they don't get a pass for but its unfortunate that decent core designs are held back severely by packaging.",Negative

AMD,"As a real world example, I upgraded my primary system from a 14700k to a 265k recently. My other desktop is a ryzen 7900 (non x, 65 watt tdp)  Compiling my os takes 6 minutes on the 7900, 10 minutes on the 265k, 10 minutes on a 3950x, and 16 minutes on the 14700k.   That is not in windows, but my os which does not have thread director or custom scheduling for e cores. (So going to be worse than windows or Linux)   All the numbers except the 7900 are with the same ssd, psu, custom water loop.  The motherboard and cpu changed between Intel builds and the 3950x was the previous build before the 14700k.   The e core performance significantly improved in arrow lake.  It’s now keeping up with 16 core am4 parts in the worst possible scenario for it.  If the scheduler was smarter, I think it would be very close to the 7900.   In windows, it’s pretty close in games I play on frame rate to the old chip. A few are actually faster.",Neutral

AMD,The ones with similar pricing not performance,Neutral
AMD,"True, except AM5 supported all cpus 7000, 9000 and will support the newest one. So not exactly true per se, because you need a new motherboard every time and those on AM5 can upgrade cpu without buying a board. Imagine if someone was on 13400F and wanted to buy lets say 285K? Well, you need a new board. So it depends what “cheaper” is seen as.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep. We all see the patterns here. Gamers nexus, HUB, LTT and most big name they all keep mocking Intel, even when Intel did good job to bring improvements to their products like fixing Arrow Lake gaming performance but those ""tech reviewer"" decided to be blind, they don't even want to revisit Intel chip and benchmark it, they don't even want to educate their viewers.    At the same time they keep overhyping Amd products to the moon like they own the stock, it's obvious now who is the real reviewer and who is fraud reviewer using their own popularity and big headline to spread their propaganda for their own benefits.

The fact that you can go from a 1700x to a 5800x3d on the same mobo for 85% more performance is crazy good value. You can say that all you want but there's a reason why in the diy market everyone is buying amd over intel. People know arrow lake is doa where as am5 actually has a future, which is why everyone is flocking to the 9800x3d in droves.  Zen 7 is rumored to be on am5 as well. Meaning that am6 would come out in 2030/2031. If that's true am5 lived for around 8/9 years.  That's insane value to get out of one socket.",Positive

AMD,"I agree with you, it’s daft, no doubt about it. But you’ve got to factor in that people can be daft too. Most tend to skimp, only to end up buying another middling CPU the following year, and then again after that. And so the cycle trundles on.  When I buy PC parts, I usually go for the best available. Provided the price is reasonably sane. I picked up a 9900K seven years ago and it’s still holding its own. Is it on par with the 9800X3D? Of course not. But it’s still a very capable bit of kit. Next time I upgrade, I’ll go top shelf again.",Neutral

A good third party reviewer would be needed to determine by how much, yet it’s probably not worth their money and time to test it.   So the truth is probably in between what Intel is saying here and what the state of things was 6 months ago.",Negative

I installed the contact frame in August, and everything was fine until two weeks ago, when the desktop suddenly stopped booting. The fans were spinning, but there was no POST, no debug LED — nothing. I thought the motherboard was dead.   However, when I removed the AIO head and tried to boot again, it worked!  Since then, I’ve been experiencing intermittent no-POST issues, especially after gaming sessions.   To get it to boot, I always have to adjust the screws on the AIO head. If it’s too tight: no POST. If it’s too loose: CPU temperatures are high. For example, in Hogwarts Legacy, I get around 60 FPS with an RTX 4090, while the CPU runs at around 18% usage @ 85°C. Which is not normal at all, as I used to run the game at around 100–110 FPS.  I tightened the screws on the contact frame using my thumb and index fingers.

AMD,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Neutral

AMD,"u/hus1030  The mounting pressure from your AIO cooler can directly affect whether the system successfully completes POST. When the cooler is tightened too much, it can cause the CPU or motherboard to bend slightly, which may lead to poor or lost contact between the CPU and the socket pins. This prevents the processor from initializing properly, resulting in a no-POST condition. Installing a contact frame changes the pressure distribution compared to the stock retention mechanism, so overtightening the AIO screws can amplify this issue. On the other hand, if the screws are too loose, the CPU temperatures will rise because the cooler is not making proper thermal contact. To avoid these problems, ensure the AIO screws are tightened evenly in a cross pattern and do not exceed the manufacturer’s torque specifications. If the issue persists, you may need to verify that the contact frame is correctly installed or temporarily revert to the original retention bracket to rule out pressure-related problems.",Neutral

AMD,"u/Any_Information429 Your HP EliteBook 830 G8 is experiencing boot issues due to corrupted Intel Management Engine (ME) firmware, which is a critical low-level system component that manages hardware initialization. This corruption is causing the blinking caps lock light, multiple restart attempts before successful boot, and the extended Windows startup times you've been experiencing. The BIOS showing ""ME Firmware Mode: Recovery Mode"" confirms this diagnosis. Since these issues began after your recent repair, it's likely that the Management Engine chip connections were disturbed or the firmware became corrupted during the service process.  To resolve this, you need to perform a forced recovery of the ME firmware by downloading the specific firmware version for your EliteBook model from HP's support website-[HP EliteBook 830 G8 Notebook PC Software and Driver Downloads | HP® Support](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/hp-elitebook-830-g8-notebook-pc/38216726) and using specialized recovery tools to reflash the Management Engine. You also have check BIOS settings to ensure proper ME configuration and temporarily disable fast boot to allow complete initialization. If the firmware recovery doesn't resolve the issue, this may indicate hardware-level damage to the ME controller that occurred during the previous repair, which would require professional chip-level service or potentially warranty coverage since the problem originated after authorized service work. The good news is that once the ME firmware is properly restored, your system should return to normal boot times and eliminate the restart cycles you're currently experiencing.  USB flash recovery method is definitely worth trying first - it's designed specifically for these types of firmware corruption issues and should get your laptop back to normal boot times without all those frustrating restarts.

Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive.

On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.

You can easily test this by monitoring 1% lows and increasing memory latency (lowering DDR4 B-die clocks/DDR5 hynix and increasing timings) to see how Cache holds up when full of assets while memory is being bottlenecked-   What games need is 10-12 P-Cores and an IMC capable of high speeds.

Its a give to compare you will need to match the clocks.  Funny you you should mention latencies, considering that core to core (even accross clusters), latencies of Skymont are better than Lion Cove? So if latency is the issue, it has nothing to do with Skymont and everything to do with the trash uncore they have based on the Meteorlake SOC. Even workstation Crestmont on a different package performs better. Furthermore skymont IPC is measured based on Arrowlake. Arrowlake is worse latency than Raptorlake and Zen already.

For the i9 they can have 4 such solitary E-cores that have their own cache and hence do not touch the L3 cache.

AMD,Balanced in full load will just do the same thing as High Performance.,Neutral
AMD,"It's capable of a few things, but the main mechanism from what I've seen is that it temporarily disables three out of four cores in each E-core cluster by forcing them into the lowest power state. The result is that the remaining active core has access to each cluster's full L2 cache (2MB on 12th-gen, 4MB on 13th/14th-gen). L2 cache isn't shared with P-cores (L3 is global), so this can really minimize E-core cache evictions before they're forced into slower memory, and games do love themselves some cache.  It's a genuinely clever way of maximizing available resources and I really wish they'd allow user control over its features, but it seems to be pretty tightly leashed to/by the team that developed it. It obviously wouldn't benefit every situation, such as particularly low/high thread occupancy situations, but it's pretty rough to have the option tied to quarterly updates for one or two specific games.",Neutral

AMD,They are they came up with ML for their upscaller before the red team did and even better than FSR as a dump upscaler and they also did a good RT implementation.

In the 80's or they shammed The DEC Alpha team on subnormal floating point operations with the 8087 FPU. Intel was doing way more precession without having to round so earlier on a consumer FPU while the Alpha CPU was a Mainframe one.

They just had the hardware for it from the get go so they could implement it quicker.  They did make Xess though which is miles ahead of FSR 3 even on AMD systems (on average.

Even on the lightest Xess mode, the performance hit was a bit too noticeable. FSR doesn't look as good as Xess but it runs better and you can get away with a bit more upscaling artifacting on the Decks relatively small screen. Just rendering at a lower res and letting the screen upscale was also a solid option in that scenario.  As I say though, that's an edge case where you really just need outright speed. If your GPU doesn't support DLSS or FSR4 then using Xess makes sense in the vast majority of cases.",Neutral

This time not only optimization for Arc GPU, but also for Intel Core CPU like proper CPU scheduling for P and E cores to make sure the game runs on the right thread.

AMD,Most likely the bLLC variant wil be single compute tile and single cache tile as this would be cheaper for now than putting bLLC cache in base tile like Amd did. They can do that when 18A-PT is avaliable which will probably be after Nova Lake goes into production with 18A or maybe 18A-P,Neutral

AMD,fym no different they're 50% faster,Neutral
AMD,No. ARL architecture is definitely not optimized for latency but hiding memory access which favours multithreading instead of gaming. Hopefully Nova Lake will optimize all the latecy issues with ARL arch and decrease latency to L3 considerably aswell,Negative
AMD,"Yes, but in games, it's the P-cores that are meant to be utilized. Also, more than eight cores or 16 threads aren't really necessary for gaming. The 9950x3d isn't faster, than the 9900x3d.  My point is that the space taken up by the E-cores could instead be used for additional cache, not?",Neutral
AMD,I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it. Anyhow if that's true the large L3 should be even more helpful for things like gaming as it will keep those higher latency hits down.

AMD,Process lasso can let you just designate by task so the E cores can do background and side jobs. People use process lasso on the 7950x3d to make the X3D chiplet run games with those 8 cores and the other 8 core chiplet for everything else.,Neutral
AMD,What issue did you run into with a 9800x3d? It has one CCD and no small cores,Neutral
AMD,"Nowadays there are very few cases where disabling E cores is extremely beneficial, sometimes they are a detriment to performance but more often than not they are useful. Not to mention the E core design team is more competent than the P core team and are quickly catching up in performance.    The E cores in Alder Lake had relatively poor ST performance but in Arrow Lake they are much faster and closer to the P cores in raw performance. Every new generation the gap keeps shrinking and it will make the disabling of E cores less and less relevant.    Sometimes the Windows scheduler will wrongly assign an E core to a ST bound task, even if a P core is available, but it doesn't happen often enough to be a serious issue.",Neutral
AMD,"yes, but not because of windows scheduling - its because you can OC higher with them off - better temps and easier stability - some people disable HT for the same.",Neutral
AMD,They don't pay attention,Negative
AMD,"No. Intel needs to do what Amd did and add seperate bLLC just for gaming. As long as latency is reduced to the L3 cache including bLLC, gaming performance will definitely increase as 285K and 9950x have similar performance in both gaming and productivity with small lead going to Amd. But x3d totally dominates ARL beacsue of the obvious huge cache difference and lower overall latency to their cache implementation.",Neutral

Do you have a source, where they directly claim the NVL cores are coming from TSMC?",Neutral
AMD,"The game is a dumpster fire when it comes to CPU utilization, it hammers even top tier gaming chips like the 9800X3D. I'm not surprised if the E cores can bottleneck the performance even further, most likely some of the game's heaviest threads get (wrongly) assigned to the E cores.    The scheduling in W11 has been significantly improved over the last few years but it's not 100% perfect either. Legacy software in particular, which typically utilizes 1 core, often ends up running in an E core and as a result you can't take advantage of the higher ST performance a P core provides. In that case you need stuff like Process Lasso to fix the problem. It doesn't happen very often but when it does it's very annoying.",Negative

AMD,"Wonder what node such a product, if it does exist, would use for the iGPU tile.   AFAIK, rumor is that the iGPU tile for the standard parts would be on 18A or an 18A variant. However, if this is a flagship part, I would assume they would be willing to pay the extra cost to use N2...   However that would also presumably involve porting the architecture over to another node, which I don't think Intel has the resources, or wants to go through the effort, to do so.   Also wonder if such a product will finally utilize the ADM cache that has been rumored since like, forever.   And this is a bit of a tangent, but I swear at this point in the leak cycle for a new Intel product, there's always usually a ton of different skus that are leaked that may or may not launch - right now we have NVL bLLC, NVL standard, and now this, and a bunch of them end up not launching (whether they were cut internally, or the leaks were just made up).

AMD,That's Panther Lake in a few months,Neutral
AMD,Lunar lake was always confirmed even by Intel as a 1 off design with soldered memory and many of its design choices.,Neutral
AMD,"No, the memory config wouldn't work.",Neutral
AMD,"That isn't that different from the AI MAX 395+ already released, which has 16 Zen 5 cores and 40CUs and some MALL cache (I think 20MB) to help with bandwidth.  For this to be a meaningful upgrade, you'd want more than 20 Xe3 cores, which means you need more bandwidth, which means you need probably LPDDR6 memory to get it high enough as otherwise the cache demands would be prohibitive and LPDDR6 memory isn't coming to client until probably 2027.",Neutral
AMD,No not really.  It's pretty f'n bleak atm.,Negative
AMD,It's N2.  Sadly Intel Inside has almost entirely become TSMC Inside,Neutral
AMD,"Nova Lake-AX will not be released, and DLLC will not be released, and nova Lake will not be released.",Neutral
AMD,"Unless they can find some way to bring down the cost.....these aren't gonna get much traction, the same applies to Strix Point of course. While more efficient than your typical 2000$ laptop with a decent GPU.....the traditional laptop is still gonna outperform them based on pure specs.  You get more battery hour and less heat but people who use these kind of laptop are used to having it plugged 24/7. Feels more like experimental models but they have a long way to go before they see proper adoption. Particularly the cost.",Negative
AMD,"> mid-range gaming  Strix halo is only in $2000 systems. high end price, mid-range performance.  Good for stock margins i guess.",Positive
AMD,I'm sure that Xe2 in Lunar Lake is faster than the 7840HS iGPU on average if you run it with the max performance mode in the OEM software that comes with your laptop.,Neutral
AMD,The 7850HS can't compete with the Xe2 igpu because it's bandwidth starved.   The 8mb of memory side cache insulating the 4mb of L2 from main memory allows the Xe2 Arc 140V igpu in LL clocked at 1950mhz to beat the RDNA 3.5 890m clocked at 2950mhz as it only has 4mb of L2 as a last level of cache before hitting memory.   TLDR: RDNA 3.5 is bandwidth starved on strix point due to lacking memory side cache,Neutral
AMD,PTL's not really a LNL successor.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, it was just to prove a point that ARM is overrated.",Negative
AMD,What about an 8 + 16 big LLC tile and 32Xe3 cores (4096 FP32 lanes or ~60 AMD CU's) + 64mb of memory side cache?   Or even better a mid range part with an 8+16 tile and 16-20Xe3 cores + 16-32mb of memory side cache,Neutral
AMD,Just read about the JEDEC spec for lpddr6 of 14400mt/s.  That is wild!,Neutral
AMD,"I hear you, questioning my decision to return under Pat’s hire-back spending spree. Dodged this one… but this is hitting differently.",Neutral
AMD,Who said it's It's entirely TSMC ? they have been pretty open about majority of tiles Intel the CPU Tile will be shared with N2 ofc though,Neutral
AMD,"It should be Intel here, TSMC there.  Or a little bit of Intc, a little bit of TSMC.",Neutral
AMD,IDM 2.0: Where we proudly declare our fabs are world-class—while quietly handing the crown jewels to TSMC.,Neutral
AMD,Source?,Neutral
AMD,"The BOM is lower, so the question is where the markup is coming from.",Neutral
AMD,Consoles have big APUs and they have better value than anything. I know they're subsidized however.,Positive
AMD,A mid range Nova Lake-A SKU with a 6+12 tile and 16/20Xe3 cores with 16-32mb of memory side cache would be sick,Neutral
AMD,Thats the problem with AMD sticking an additional 8 cores instead of infinity cache to fix the bandwidth bottleneck.,Negative
AMD,>still cheaper,Neutral
AMD,"It's the closest that we will get to a Lunar Lake successor   Really, panther lake is a combined successor to both Arrow Lake-H and Lunar Lake",Neutral
AMD,"Low volume and a giant chip package most likely. That GPU tile is going to be expensive. Look at Strix Halo for reference.  Combine that with not moving a lot of them compared to the rest of the lineup, and each one of those units has to make up more of the costs from things like bad dies or general spin up costs for a new chip.",Negative
AMD,It already has 32MB infinity cache.,Neutral
AMD,The 7840HS is cheaper because it is older.,Neutral
AMD,"It competes in the U/H lanes, so what is today ""ARL""-U and ARL-H. But yes, in practice it should bring *most* of the LNL goodness over, but PTL-U is still not a true successor in the original ~10W envelope LNL was designed for.",Neutral
AMD,"> and a giant chip package most likely. That GPU tile is going to be expensive. Look at Strix Halo for reference   It's no bigger than the equivalent dGPU, and you save on memory, package, and platform costs. Half the point of these things is to use the integrated cost advantage to better compete with Nvidia dGPUs.",Negative
AMD,The new Ryzen AI 250/260 with 780M is still cheaper because it doesn't have copilot+ .,Neutral
AMD,I will see the performance envelope of PTL U and decide should dump my LNL or not,Neutral
AMD,"The low volume part of that quote is important. If you're making heaps of them, each can take up a little bit of the startup costs for that design. If you only make a few, those costs get concentrated on what you do make.  Low volume also means a single defect is promotionally more of your possible units, and hits the margins harder. You do get more total defects in a larger run, but at sufficiently high quantities of those defects, you start making lower bins to recover some of the defects. If you hardly make the volume to cover one widespread SKU, you aren't likely to have enough to make a cheaper one with any degree of availability. At some point you hit a threshold where it's not worth selling what would be a lower bin because there's not enough of them.",Neutral
AMD,Because putting a 40 TOPs NPU for the Copilot+ certification is costly.,Neutral
AMD,"It doesn't have a 40 TOPS NPU, it's the same 16TOPS one in the 8840HS it's literally just another rebrand. It's cheap because it's from 2023.",Neutral
AMD,Exactly. Hence your Xe2 lunar lake being faster is irrelevant to the question because it won't be cheaper regardless of age when they have a NPU that takes close to 1/3 of die space.,Negative
AMD,I think I didn't say anything that deviates from what you just said.,Neutral
AMD,"Maybe I misread or misunderstood, I thought you said the 260/250 had a 40TOPS NPU",Neutral
AMD,enjoy rhythm aware outgoing practice bike attempt library versed cake   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*,Neutral
AMD,Haha wow that is hilariously bad.   And here I thought ASUS newer bios update was bad due to some higher temps,Negative
AMD,"The new Gigabyte BIOS also has booting issues for me, and memory is even more unstable.  At least the UI is entirely in English now.",Negative
AMD,"who needs quality control, what can go wrong?",Negative
AMD,Gigabyte is trash,Neutral
AMD,The Elon Musk method,Neutral
AMD,"> “Yeah just push it to production nothing’s gonna happen, no need to QA/QC this”  Seems to be the motto of a lot of the tech world",Negative
AMD,"Yup indeed.   I would even go as far as one full month   Hence, why I learned to avoid installing new Windows Update automatically",Neutral
